												Aside from an amazing Single-Player experience and playing some of it with friends I still just cannot recommend the game because of some serious issues with Rockstar. And that is because of the many things you have been hearing from the many reviews of others...

And that would be the online part of the game which many bought into to play with others in the GTA universe, and it has Grind/Pay2Win/Microtransactions/Bannings/Hackers/Trolls/Bad Customer Service and a very toxic community that this game has created. And since the creators have had little or no change in helping the many with these issues than they get the rating they deserve. *FAIL*"

												I love this game to death but there is one thing I can't ignore.
The anti-cheat system.
So if you still want to get this game I'll leave a few tips for you to avoid getting banned.

-See a cheater, get out of the lobby
-Don't use mods even for single player
-Don't use third party overlays

If I find anymore ways I'll update, anyways I hope this helps anyone looking into the game.

Edit: These are just precuactions even doing these you might not avoid the bans."

												Updated review.


After so many hours of playing I can tell you with absolute certainty that GTA Online is a big piece of crap filled with pretty pixels. The whole online infrastucture is so frikkin bad that it sucks any possible fun you could have in the game right out of you.  And still up today R* keeps releasing new pixel junk updates on the same piece of crap online p2p infrastructure to milk the consumers even more... with no intention at all to really improve the whole online experience. 
 
Online experience: 
 
Start the game. Get a 2 minute loading screen. Choose online mode. Get a 2 minute loading screen. You are logged into a session without any other players. Okay fine, lets do a quick race then against some players. Choose quick race. 2 minute loading screen.'No active race could be found'. Only options in the menu you have now is 'host a race' or 'join a random mission'. Choose host a race. .... loading screen. You are dropped in a random race alone. Set 'auto invite' active. wait 10 minutes and still nobody to race with. You escape out of the session and go back to freeroam. 2 minute loading screen. Okay back at freeroam, check for other players. Nope, you are again in a session alone. So lets do the 'random race' again. ... and you get where I am going at. You get the same frikking loading screen crap and again the terrible barely functioning p2p matchmaking bull crap. Imagine doing this for 10 hours, imagine doing this for a 100 or a 1000 hours.  And in the mean time R* tries to get you to buy sharkcards ,because they made all the cars etc intentionally expensive... and then you have to grind for ingame money in this piece of crap online infrastructure. What a joke!

Story mode: Really cool, love it! even more a shame that R* abandoned story mode completely and went for online mode cash grab scheme. 


R*, one of the biggest sell out companies of the last years.


And pls note: I play GTAV on a good gaming rig and with a 200MB fibrewire connection."

												First of all...
ROCKSTAR IS NOT BANNING FOR SINGLE PLAYER MODS. They've now stated this outright. I mean seriously, when did we start believing people who were banned, just because they say they're innocent? 90% of these new negative reviews are unfounded and outright lies. Not only that, but they have no changed the EULA, either. If you have a DLL injector installed in your game directory, it DOESN'T MAGICALLY STOP WORKING WHEN YOU GO ONLINE. Just because you don't use it, it's STILL there. YOUR OWN FAULT.

Like seriously, when did people get dumb enough to think an anti cheat wouldn't pick up DLL INJECTORS? DLL INJECTORS ARE THE MOST COMMON WAY HACKS EXIST. *headdesks* There are two groups of people - actual cheaters, who got banned from online for cheating using the scripthook and trainer (dll injection), and then there's people who only used it in single player but left it installed when they went online. Newsflash - it's still there, it's still injected into the games memory.

In any case, the game is great. There's a few speed bumps and quirks here and there that need to be worked out, as with any game so soon after launch, but overall it performs great, online is fun, and you can mod single player. Not really a lot more you can ask for, amirite?

9/10, because I don't believe in perfect scores.

P.S. Stop being idiots.

Edit: In light of a few ignorant jackasses, here's the proof:

“I’m having soo much fun with GTAV on the PC but I just have one question about it, how come you are not allowing mods for it?” - @ClarkMatthew63
“Will I get banned from GTA Online for using a FoV Mod or Oculus Rift mod?” - @Mattophobia



We have always appreciated the creative efforts of the PC modding community and we still fondly remember the awesome zombie invasion mod and original GTA map mod for GTAIV PC among many other classics. To be clear, the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for GTAIV.  Recent updates to GTAV PC had an unintended effect of making unplayable certain single player modifications. This was not intentional, no one has been banned for using single player modifications, and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player PC mods. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing. It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized, they may be broken by technical updates, cause instability, or affect your game in other unforeseen ways.

But by all means - let's just believe the banned people because they said ""they didn't do it"". It's not like cheaters to lie about it or anything."

												The game itself is good, but Rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice. They're forcing you to buy the game AND Shark Cards, which are just in-game multiplayer money, while the game is on ""sale"".

This shouldn't be acceptable. It's basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming it's on sale.

UPDATE: Look at how old this review is people, this was for the Summer Sale, during which it was impossible to buy the base game without purchasing the shark card bundle. So you could not get the base game on sale, you had to purchase it along with a shark card which made the game full price.

This also made it so you couldn't refund the game, due to the Shark Card being considered DLC."

												This is the home GTA V always deserved, but never got, until now.

Welcome home. We've all been waiting for you.


EDIT: After playing for a while I can attach a more informative review. Will update further when enough time is spent with the story and Online portion.

Performance-wise, the game runs relatively well on my GTX 680. I have suffered from an apparent memory leak bug that forces me to shut down the game, but it can be fixed by adding more virtual memory page file size (look it up on the internet). Aside from that, the launch has been relatively smooth for me.

The game world is full of detail. Put on sunglasses and you notice your vision is actually tinted. Park your bike in front of an entrance and a guy might shout you to move it. It's really the kind of benchmark-setting experience that makes other open world games look bland and lifeless.

In my opinion, the story and mission pacing are far steadier and faster than in GTA IV. 
Driving is a little bit better, hard to pinpoint exactly what makes it so, but to me it feels more responsive. Shooting can feel clumsy, especially in first-person, and the guns don't feel all that special, but it's still fun.

In addition to the updated graphics, the other PC-exclusive features include a custom radio station and the Rockstar Editor. Custom radio station is pretty simple. Add music files to a folder in the Documents, and you've got a Self Radio station in-game. It works, nothing more to add. 

As for the Rockstar Editor, it's really simple and fun to use. You mainly use markers to change cameras, apply effects, slow motion et cetera. I tested it for a bit and the end result is this:

(I'm planning to make longer and better videos in the near future)

The online feature can be a little bit confusing for new players to get into first, since it lacks direction, but you'll get it. Haven't played it too much to comment further, but it's fun to play jobs with friends, although the progression feels half-baked.

Thanks for reading my review. I'm planning to report on narrative and more of GTA Online soon."

Im sorry to tell you, but you will get banned for no reason in this game. My 2 friends go banned in GTA online for reasons that R* did not tell us. After this christmas, more than 84.000 players got banned and yes some of them were cheaters/modders, but if you are unfortunate enough to connect to a session with these kind of players, than GG, you will be banned in the next week/month. This is because R* are too lazy to employ people to look after the game, instead they have this broken, stupid system that bans everyone left and right.

shady ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s think you can get away with pulling a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ trick like this? You made alot of people disapointed rockstar.

I know atleast 27 people IRL who were waiting for steam summer sale to buy gta v.

Do math: (59.99-(59.99*.25))= about 45 dollars per game.

Now multiply by 27 and you get an easy 1215 dollars. Now you get none of that money because of your shady ♥♥♥ taticts.

You should be ashamed in yourself rockstar... Such a great game and you have the audacity to pull a gimic like this. I thought pc games had the definitive edition of GTA... Thought wrong I guess."

Online is garbage as stated, no need to beat a dead horse

But the story, the story was abnosultely terrible. Let me just start off with saying, I don't care, didn't care, and couldn't care about the main characters. We start off with a Bank Heist and the main characters are immediately given out as heartless bad guys. I know GTA is about being bad, but hear me out. In 4 I cared about Niko, he was an immigrant coming to America, trying to start fresh, start new, get his life going, live the dream. He has a cousin already established, and that cousin helps him grow. We feel attached to Niko, we care about Roman, the story has it's ups and downs, it's a classic story of trying to do the right thing. Now GTA V, a bunch of heartless thieves with shallow back stories and no depth to them. Why should I care about some random hood gangster, why would I care about a guy who's more than well off and has a comfy home life, why would I care about a batshit insane trailer trash guy? I can't feel for these characters, everything bad that happens to them is because they deserved it. Niko and Roman were trying to make it good, were trying to start new, but these guys, they're just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. And who cares about a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s."

												GTA V is a hit-or-miss game. The greatness shines in the singleplayer with its amazing and flamboyant narrative, good character development, and well-written dialogue. I would certainly recommend buying the game purely for the story mode - at a discount of course. I don't think it's worth the $59.99 price tag as it is. If you're a fan of a good crime narrative, GTA V is definitely the game for you.

Perhaps the weakest element of GTA V is the online mode. Most of the reviews here are complaining about the modders, hackers, false bans, and griefing players who ruin the experience for other players, which is quite true. However, let's dive into the more fundamental elements of the online mode's overall design structure. This review will be mainly about the online experience, as Rockstar continues to update the game's online sessions with new adversary modes and DLC today.  If you're buying the game solely for the online experience, exercise caution. 

 DESIGN : In a nutshell, GTA V's online design is nothing short of awful. The menus are incredibly cluttered with lists upon lists of jobs (mission, races, stunt races) to do, and some of them don't show up. If you want to do a mission, you'll need to scroll through menus of needless tabs just to get to your specific mission unless you bookmark it. If you want to do missions with your friends, you'll need to go through multiple loading screens to start them. Loading back to free-roam takes a few minutes. 

Matchmaking is some of the worst I've seen in an online experience; it can take anywhere from one to fifteen minutes to gather a group of 2-4 players together to do any mission. When the game actually does pair you up with someone else - assuming you don't have many friends who play the game - it is with literally any player with any skill level. The game will sometimes pair a high-level player with most of the weapons and rewards unlocked with a low-level player with most of the weapons locked, often causing the job to fail due to player inexperience. Invites sometimes don't reach your friends, glitches with menus occur, and there are still many gamebreaking bugs that prevent the online mode from being a decent experience. 

If you're a fresh player just joining GTA V Online, good luck - most of the weapons are locked behind a level requirement. It will take you weeks to months to gain enough reputation to get the weapon you want - rocket launchers, grenade launchers, explosives, etc. Rockstar can also dish out permanent bans regardless of behavior, and you cannot appeal them. In summary, don't anger Rockstar.

 AI : Very unforgiving. At times, the AI will be perfectly cunning, dodging and weaving around obstacles to gun you down where you stand. During missions and heists however, most of them are unfair. They never seem to miss; they always have their reticles glued to you, so the moment you pop your head out to return fire, they quickly whittle away what little health you have. 

You can restore health in combat with snacks - purchased from convenience stores around Los Santos in free roam/freemode. If you want to heal when you're being gunned down by police, mercenaries, or gangsters, you guessed it; you need to open your interaction menu, scroll down to inventory, scroll down to snacks, and spam the enter key to heal your character, then exit the menu to resume combat. Run out of snacks or armor during a mission? You will need to quit to freemode, drive to another convenience store - or CEO office - and restock them. Buy too much and the convenience store will run out of snacks, forcing you to drive to another convenience store to buy more. How inconvenient.

The AI isn't easy at all online, and requires precise movements, well-stocked equipment and health, and pure luck to beat them down.

 JOBS : Some online jobs - similar to quests in an RPG - require you to have more than 2 players. If you start a solo session or an invite only session, most of the fun jobs are all closed off, with Rockstar prompting you to join a public session with other unpredictable players in the lobby, because Rockstar wants the playerbase to mingle. In hindsight, it might seem like a great way to connect with other players, but with the hit-or-miss community of ""public lobby"" GTA V Online coupled with matchmaking flaws, it's difficult to get anything done.

Want to do a heist? You are required to gather 4 players together to do them. Individual heist setups can take anywhere from 5-20 minutes. If you fail a heist setup? Moreoften, you may restart from a checkpoint and try it again. If a player leaves the heist setup? Everyone fails the mission, and the party leader will need to exit to freemode, go back to their apartment, re-initiate the heist, and find 4 new players, rinse and repeat. Heist finales contain the highest payouts, with rewards spanning from $80,000 to $200,000 depending on the heist, and can range anywhere between 10-30 minutes to complete. There are rarely checkpoints in heist finales; players have team lives instead of individual lives. If one player dies, your team loses a life, and in 99% of the heist finales, only one team life is available. Therefore, if one player continues to die and uses up your team's lives, you will need to replay the entire heist finale from the beginning or checkpoint. If one player leaves or disconnects while the heist is in progress, you will need to gather another 4 players to do the heist finale from the start. 

 PLAYERBASE : GTA V Online's playerbase is really a hit or miss, though they should be somewhat feared. There are some decent and friendly players who are looking to have fun with heists, rewards, and such, but the majority of the time you'll be killed the moment you leave your apartment - run over by cars, sniped from afar, etc; this can be combatted with the game's passive mode - a mode in which other players cannot attack you, and you cannot attack other players or pedestrians. The problem with this mode is that you can't rob stores, take part in public lobby events, or defend yourself when the cops begin pursuing you.

Also, there doesn't appear to much of a localization option with other players; you are grouped together with players from around the world. God forbid you get paired up in a serious heist where communication is next to impossible due to a language barrier. 50% of the time, you'll luckily encounter an English-speaking player. Most of the other players are from other countries, which makes coordinating missions and jobs frustrating if you or others don't speak a common language.

 DLC/BUSINESS MODEL : The game's online items and cars are progressively getting more and more expensive. Super/hypercars cost upwards of $1,000,000 to $6,000,000. There is a plane in-game for $10,000,000. Luxury yachts go from $6,000,000 to $10,000,000. CEO offices go from $1,000,000 to $6,000,000. Apartments go anywhere from $40,000 to $2,000,000. If you're earning $10,000 per job, and about $80,000 per heist in a great while, you bet it will take a long time to buy the things you want. Rockstar releases ""free DLC"" every few months, which are nothing more than introductions of new vehicles and buildings with inflated price tags. Don't want to play the game to earn money? Simply buy shark cards. $20 USD gets you 1.2 million dollars. $100 USD gets you 8 million dollars. And Rockstar wonders why modders and money hackers grow by the minute. The business model with ""free DLC"" is simply a hellish sanctuary for micro-transactions. You're not buying a $60 game. You're conned into paying for a $500+ game; that is, unless you either grind out every bit of cash slowly, or stay the heck away from online.

Overall? Beautiful story. Story mode gets  9/10. Greedy Rockstar in online mode. Bad design, mixed playerbase, unfair AI, disappointing rewards, but fun with friends. Online gets a  4/10."

												Used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didn't want to make it look like a sale. Should have never went on sale, or pretended to. I don't think the game costs 80$.

EDIT: Let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about. This was posted when R* was doing their shady steam sale promotion. At the beginning you couldn't buy GTA V alone, at it's regular price of $59.99. You could buy it at the same price but with it's in game money card. Which was the only way to buy it, unless you wanted GTA San Andreas or Max Payne. So if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some Googling about what happened. If they hadn't put it on sale GTA V could only be bought at $84.99, so it was a fake sale."

												GTA 5 finally arrives on PC after a long delay but the big question is, was it worth the wait? 

If you haven't played GTA on previous and current gen consoles then this you will definitely want to get it. The campaign on  its own is totally worth the price and with all the Stranger missions, you will be occupied for some time. However, the multiplayer is what will keep you coming back to the game for more.  Rockstar's main focus post-release is on GTA: Online and with their regular release of free updates, there's always something new for players to try out. For any beginners to GTA: Online, here's a handy and short guide with all the need to know

Moving onto performance which is one of the reasons why GTA was delayed so much for PC. There doesn't actually seem to be any major problems with running it. Because the game was made with PS3/Xbox 360 in mind, the required specs aren't amazingly high. Obviously, if you want to be running it in all it's glory and at high resolutions then you will need better equipment."

												Would I recommend Grand Theft Auto V: Yes - well made game.
Would I recommend Grand Theft Auto Online: No - here's why:

I logged on earlier today only to find I have been permanently banned (ironically I was looking at the recent reviews moments beforehand and wondering what they were talking about). Now I myself have fallen victim to a ridiculous fault in the game itself.

Did I break the rules? No
Was I given a reason/date/any information? No
Could I appeal? No

When I tried to appeal, not once but twice, I received an automated response (under new regulations) that I could not appeal from a ban.

Advice: If you planning on buying this game for singeplayer, go ahead. If you were planning to delve into GTA online...don't. If you do, all I can advise is: to play in friendly lobbies, don't record your gameplay, make sure your internet is 100% stable, never play missions with random people or do anything publically.

As you can see this is very limiting, but any one of these reasons could have gotten me banned. Rockstar has the worst anti-cheat system I have ever seen and I did not expect to buy the game and be unable to play it after spending around 500 hours on it (which makes it all the more bitter). It is honestly such a shame that they had to ruin a fun game, fortunately there are other games that will not disappoint you as much as this one."

												So I don’t really write reviews, I’m too lazy or just don’t have the time in my life.

 But for this game I’m willing to bother, mainly because of the  ATROCITIES  that this game possesses. Single player is great sure, but online is such a bigger part of this game now, most people play it just for that mode. But I’m sure you’ve seen other reviews saying: “modders have ruined it!” and “online is no fun cos of hackors!”.

Well that’s because it’s true. All of it.

Allow me to put this as realistically as possible.

I have amassed a total of 420 hours on GTAV. Didn’t play the campaign, I had already done that when it first arrived on console. No, these hours are mainly online play. I’ve grinded mission after mission to earn the cash. I’ve spent hours buying, customizing and completing challenges. I now have a profile that has all the levelled unlocks, cars and guns you could ever want, making it a very hard earned profile.

HOWEVER, I have now lost most (if not all) of my desire to switch this game on, and I’m sure you have a pretty good idea of why that is. Nether the less, I shall give you an example of a typical session of online play if you were to enter the game today (which let’s face it, is the main reason why we play it).

Enter my first match. > begin attempt to have fun. > Player arrives on a bike and kills me to death. > very well, I shall retaliate by firing a rocket at his bike. > Rocket hits.  > But wait, the player didn’t die. > Then quickly learn from further attempts and other players that he is using God-mode > I then attempt to use the player menu to ‘vote to kick’ him, as others were attempting to do the same thing  > Turns out he has used a mod that removes his name from the player list, making it impossible to kick him out of the match. > I then call him out for using Mods (with restraint to call him many, many things) > At this point he proceeds to delete my car and spawn 100,000 things on my head, making my game crash to desktop (and probably anyone else who was near-by in game).

Now after lots and lots of match surfing, I can quite confidently state the following with applied calculation and experience: 

If you buy this game for the online side of play, roughly 1 in 3 of your free-roam sessions will be rife with situations similar to this ^.


So to give you an evaluation:

 If you are a normal player – 

Prepare to have unfair play, have your things deleted, and get crashed to desktop by modder’s whenever you challenge their actions, because Rockstar will never regulate and control this issue.

 If you are wanting to be a modder – 

You can enjoy being invincible, gank on players then delete everyone’s things, and if they call you out you can just crash everyone, because you are a big man and Rockstar will never regulate or control this issue. Then they’ll write negative reviews, losing the game its popularity to a point where it just becomes garbage. Then you’ll have it all to yourself, and your mission to alienate everyone from online play will be complete.


To quote another game (that I would recommend more tbh):

“Well done Stanley, everyone thinks you’re very powerful.”


P.S - The second biggest issue is the micro-transactions, and rockstar's ever vigilant attempt to take in-game money from you in order to force you into buying shark cards with real money. but that needs a whole review in itself to detail that issue (which i really dont have the time in my life for).
   

My only hope is that enough people will see this review and get it to the bench, so that maybe some people will decide not to ruin this game with bad modder/hacker behaviour.

 06/16 Edit: 

Rockstar did a ban wave and disabled the ability to use console (apparently), soo... yay?
Wonder if my moaning review had some sort of effect, anyway im going to leave this here just as a principle.

 02/17 Edit: 

Well here we are again. Rockstar have dropped the ball and now modder/hackers/whatever you wanna call them, have returned. Its worse than ever now. Back to the drawing board...."

												The PC version of GTA V is definitely the best version. We had to wait really long, but the game finally came out in a fantastic state. Rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the PC port/version. I'm usually against pre-ordering games, but I made one exception this year for GTA, and im happy with my decision. I didn't do it for the pre-order bonus (because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat) , I did it just so I could preload all GB's in time for launch, because the game is ridiculously big. 

I'm running it at 60-90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on ""high"", except for the advanced options, which is something you should only use if your running SLI or one really good card. I have a Nvidia gtx 680, which is a few years old now, so im very impressed with how good I can get the game to run. You can also use GeForce experience with GTA, because Nividia released a update for that day before launch.

You can play GTA in first or third person mode, and simply change between them on your controller. All cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person. Some textures are a little blurry in first person, but that is something to expect in a game of this size. Fighting, swimming, walking can also be done in first person, so you can just pick what you like the best.

If you have an SSD drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for GTA, because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long. It's one of the only complains I have with GTA actually. Thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online, because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens.

Singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written. You can swap between them in the open world, but also in certain quests. Michael, Trevor and Franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then GTA IV's only character, Niko.

GTA online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in. I really just bought it for the single-player experience, but after playing a few hours with my friends I have to say that GTA online is actually really fun. I think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run, but to play free-roam with friends will never get old. You also unlock heist in level 12, so that might refresh things even more.

I play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends I've talked to is doing the same thing. I strongly recommend it, at least for the driving. You can enable auto-aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard, or you can swap between your keyboard+mouse in combat, and use controller for driving. When you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates, which I think makes you feel more immersed in the game.

I tried the PC controls and I didn't like them at all. For example you have to hit ""Z"" to see how many players are on your server in online mode. You can however rebind all keys on keyboard, mouse, and controller so thats really good, but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid.

GTA is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come. I have already played it a lot and I feel like I have much more leveling to do in GTA online, much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come. Singleplayer was all I really needed, so I will just see GTA online as a plus.

Well done Rockstar! This is the best PC version you have ever made and I can see that you put a lot of effort, time and love into creating it. Strongly recommend this title to all my friends, whether your the single or multiplayer guy, you will have a ton of fun. This will probably be one of the best games released this year."

												GTA is a great game, I really enjoyed playing it on singleplayer and completing all missions.

However, if you intend to play it online (which I don't recommend) you should be really careful right now.

I just got banned but did not use any cheat or did anything wrong. 
I was in a heist and out of the blue I got the message:

""Your account was used in violation of our Terms of Service and/or EULA (...)
As a result, your account has been suspended from playing GTA Online on PC for 30 days. In addition to being suspended, all GTA Online characters, progress and inventory on PC will be reset.""

Later I found out people are getting banned because they were using some softwares like Discord, Teamspeak, Bandicam
Fraps, OBS, XSplit. 
I was using Discord to chat with friends and was recording the game with Xsplit, so I guess this was the reason for the ban.

Then I opened a ticket to explain the situation and thought that everything was going to be ok, but...
I got an automated message that said: ""All GTA Online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed."" and my ticket was closed.

Nice customer service. 10/10

												So the game was great. I had a blast playing online with my friends. I wasted 250 hours of my life in this game, I thought maybe I would get to play more.

Now you may wonder why I don't reccomend this game. Here it is:

Rockstar is a blantantly terrible company that bans people from the game that were ACCUSED but never actually did. This past week I recieved a permanent ban from the game because I was NEAR a modder causing chaos and someone falsely accused me and reported me. The very next day I got the ban. I sent in a support ticket, even said the modder's name that the report was meant for and the response I got was ""All bans are final decisions and cannot be appealed"". Keep in mind their support tickets have an option to ask for a BAN APPEAL. Why make it an option if you refuse to do it.

												When I bought this game a couple of weeks ago and playing for a while as a Nice Guy character, I couldn't imagine that GTA Online now is the Stalinist Russia Simulator. Every action may be compromised, even if it it's not prohibited, it may be punished but at the same time some of the cheaters can play loose under the protection of modders and spoil community's life. Who are not protected, but not guilty, who are the real victims will stay in GULAG of ban with real lawbreakers and the whole community would perceive them equally, because they don't have an opportunity to know for what they've been banned. With no opportunity to appeal! And after all of thise in a month I'd have to play with permanent fear, with no certainty that if I play fair I would not be punished? 
The problem isn't real, until it concerns you or your friends. Mention it please. And it isn't sacrilege, it's reality.
Btw thank you Rockstar. You made near fascist regime in your small online world. Bravo

Купив на распродаже спустя столько лет после выхода данный продукт ради онлайна, и отыгрывая там дружелюбного парня, я не предполагал, что ГТА онлайн на самом деле является симулятором жизни при Сталинском режиме, когда каждое действие, будь оно названо запрещенным или нет, возможно будет караться, в то время как те кто действительно портят жизнь сообществу свободно будут существовать под защитой моддера, тогда как остальные будут сидеть в общем ГУЛАГе бана наравне с настоящими преступниками, а само это сообщество будет воспринимать их точно так же. Конечно, как будто не было невинно осужденных. Без возможности оспорить ничего! 
И после этого когда бан через месяц пройдет я должен буду продолжить играть без уверенности в том, что честная игра не принесет перманентный бан!
Проблемы нет, пока она не пришла в ваш дом. Примите к сведению. Это не кощунство, это реальность.

												Grand Theft Auto VNote: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.
   Field  Rating  Review    Graphics  9  A huge graphical jump from GTA IV, GTA V brings us the city of Los Santos, in grand detail, from the towering Skyscrapers, to the beautiful mountains. You'll find yourself constantly surprised by the level of detail that Rockstar put into this massive world. Gorgeous lighting effects, incredible weather effects, fantastic audio, and smooth animations come together to immerse you in Los Santos on a whole new level, especially when you check out First Person mode. As with most games though, faces leave something to be desired, though they are a huge leap from GTA IV.     Gameplay  10  From raging shootouts, to daring getaways, GTA V is a game that's hard to step away from once you start playing. Fantastic levels of customization for your clothing, cars and hair. The well-written dialogue and voice acting help to bring Los Santos to life as you ride through a bustling downtown, or take a relaxing drive through the mountains. Time and time again you'll turn a corner and find yourself complete surprised at what you find there. You could easily waste hours just poking around the environment. There is something here for everyone.     Story  7  A decent length story to go through, which spans across multiple intertwining characters. GTA V delivers another decent story by Rockstar. Though not particularly enthralling for the first bit, it certainly picks up the pace as it gets further along. You'll meet some fantastically outlandish characters in typical Rockstar fanshion, and get caught up in some ridiculous events. GTA V accomplishes what it sets out to be, a blast from start to finish.    Multiplayer  9.5  This is frankly where GTA V shines the most. A massive improvement upon GTA IV's multiplayer. With the inclusion of Heists, GTA V added a grand amount of depth to the multiplayer, allowing you to set out on multi-step missions with your friends. Or, you can simply cruise around Los Santos and murder as you please. Take selfies together in hilarious places, get in fistfights on top of skyscrapers. Skydive, swim, play darts, tennis, or golf. Watch a movie, go to strip club! Get completely smashed!  Survive an onslaught of Meth dealers, or cops, together! Play it however you want, create the character you prefer with a great level of customization being offered. The only place that GTA V loses points is in its absolutely awful menu system. Creating a private session, much less staying in it, with your friends is a convoluted process that Rockstar hopefully sorts out. Loading times are also horrendous, even with the game installed on an SSD. But don't let that stop you from playing multiplayer in GTA V. It is not an experience you want to miss out on.    Replayability  10  There are plenty of ways to die in Los Santos, and you'll spend a long time enjoying each and every one of them. Especially with your friends. The huge array of missions and activities in the world offer you plenty of incentive to come back and play again and again.    Overall  9.6/10  Though it took Rockstar an absurd amount of time to prepare the PC version of GTA V, it's a slam dunk by all accounts. Easily the best GTA yet, especially when multiplayer is taken into consideration. With massive replay value, great graphics, enjoyable gameplay, and lots more going for it, GTA V is a game that any player would be hard pressed not to enjoy. 



Also of worthy note is the video editor: Here's a clip I put together of my friends and I having some fun: The Chase

												I never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big. Rockstar has priced GTA V to $80 and reduced it to $60, then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra ♥♥♥♥ no one wants. By bundling the game with the micro transaction money, anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund. Not only is this a violation of FTC regulation and EU law, it is the biggest ♥♥♥♥ move I have seen on steam yet. I would have rather had my $60 go to the WarZ devs than this ♥♥♥♥. Since then, rockstar has added the ability to buy GTA V alone for $60. Truly a noble move. They don't even have this level of garbage business on consoles."

												Bought this game to celebrate getting university finished for the year.  I did quite well with marks, so I figured it was well worth trying out a game to join some of my mates in the online mode.

$60 down the drain.
Took 12h to download this monster, and after *wait for it* 4 hours of playing, two of which being in GTA Online, I get banned.
I check emails and apparently I violated Terms of Use/EULA, without any specification as to what rules I broke.
Sent a request, regarding Ban Appeals to customer service only to get an automated response with copy-paste ""bans are final and cannot be appealed""

So, I log in, create a character, pinch an NPC's car, do some missions, buy some clobber (cheap t-shirt, pants, and shoes), I rob a convenience store as just after I vault a fence to escape the cops, I get hit with the banhammer.

And because I spent more than 2 hours (read: 4.2 hours) in-game, I am also ineligible for steam refund.

Whatever the single player is, I bought the game to play online with my mates.
Appalling customer service (i.e. unacceptable lack of customer service) and a solid middle finger.
Don't waste your time with this scam."

												Hey guys, I don't usually write reviews, but Grand Theft Auto V is a game that is absolutely worth it.

A game that breaked most impressive records of Guiness Book:



        Best-selling action-adventure video game in 24 hours (12 milion copies)
        Best-selling video game in 24 hours (564 milion$)

        Most viewed trailer for an action-adventure video game
        Most viewed trailer of an action-adventure video-game (800+ milion views)



Graphics

1. Graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible. The game runs smooth on any kind of GPU's and CPU's as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements. By the way, these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details.

2. Graphic details are the best I have seen, especially in an open-world game. If I was to tell you all about this topic, I would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours, because boy there are lots to talk about. I'm just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me. 

a) Day/Night cycle recreation. Sure this is not something new in its essence, it has been done before and not just in GTA, but the way we see it here it's what's amazing. The way the light shifts from one period of the day to another it's off the charts. You don't even realize when the afternoon becomes evening. The only way you can tell, it's that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you.

b) Rain. Again, not a new feature, actually is quite an old one BUT the way it's been reproduced in GTAV ... You can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact. Apart from the obvious, what makes rain so special in GTAV ? Well, THE SOUND. This is something that not many people talk about, yet is one of the breathtaking features of the game.The way Rockstar Games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain (besides everything else).

c) Night time, baby! Sure we had night in GTA IV and even before that, so why do I mention this ? Well, because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows. I am not talking just about the graphics aspect. What I'm saying is that the night in GTAV gives you the impression of actual liveliness; the whole city comes to life. It's just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever.

3. Cars are the best looking and are way ahead those we've seen in previous GTA's. I'm not talking about a direct comparison, because of the obvious reason (2015-2010) but what I'm trying to say is that I personally wasn't that impressed at the time by the cars/helis/planes in GTA4 as I am now in GTAV.

Gameplay and Features

Oh yea, the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for GTAV to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come.

1. Car Control I feel like thanking Rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter. Car control was preety much garbage in GTA IV and for this reason alone I had no big expectations for this new series. Well, I was wrong. The car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing NFS MW back in the day. Besides the control, there is the sound of the car's engine which is perfectly accurate.

2. Randomness. Now what in God's name I'm talking about?! Well, have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help ? A woman's that was about to get ♥♥♥♥♥, a kid who's bike was stolen, hitchhiker asking you to take her/him home, etc usually for a reward. If you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal, but baby, this stuff gives GTAV a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game.

3. Los Santos Customs. Again, not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special. Have you tried modifying the car's suspension? Of course you did, what am I saying! But have you actually paid attention of it's realism AFTER the change was made? Well, for those who haven't and for the one's who dont own the game yet, let me tell you that this feature is game-making. My favorite car in GTAV is the Grotti Carbonizzare also known as the Ferarri F12. Now think, how am I gonna drive that beast on the city's roads? Especially in areas like Groove, Hilwood, Rockford. These are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads, so you cant really drive a Ferarri in these parts of the town. Well, you can. Modifying the suspension to a higher state doesn't just make for visual effects, but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads, turns, hard turns. BTW, if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn, you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings. For me, this is one of the best things I've seen in this game. 

4. Activities. Driving, mission making, robberies, flying, hunting, diving, piloting aircrafts, submarines, boats, golf, tennis, cards, smoke weed, racing, playing the stock market. You will never get bored in this game, not even in Single Player mode.   

There are so many more things to talk about, but the review would be monstruosly long, so In a few words: buy the game, it will be the best investment you have done in a PC game. For those who thaught the review was too long and skipped to the bottom, I can tell you in short, that this game excels in every aspect:: Weapons look so realistic in First Person mode, cars have a mind blowing realistic control, weather has never been better reproduced, etc. GL&HF"

												So the game was great. I had a blast playing online with my friends. I wasted 250 hours of my life in this game, I thought maybe I would get to play more.

Now you may wonder why I don't reccomend this game. Here it is:

Rockstar is a blantantly terrible company that bans people from the game that were ACCUSED but never actually did. This past week I recieved a permanent ban from the game because I was NEAR a modder causing chaos and someone falsely accused me and reported me. The very next day I got the ban. I sent in a support ticket, even said the modder's name that the report was meant for and the response I got was ""All bans are final decisions and cannot be appealed"". Keep in mind their support tickets have an option to ask for a BAN APPEAL. Why make it an option if you refuse to do it.

8/10 if you play in private lobbies with your friends
1/10 if you play online with randoms"

WHAT KIND OF LOGIC IS THAT? YOU CAN'T APPEAL BANS?

the anti-cheats not even good... countless cheaters online. every update halts them for... a few days max?

sigh.

edit for clarification: 

- The game is grindy, but in my opinion fun. Solo play is rough, though.
- The community is overall pretty bad.
- This entire review is only based off of online. I played maybe 2 hours of Singleplayer. I know it is a good game, but not my cup of tea.

edit 2: my ban has expired and a few friends helped me earn a few million with heists, still stand by the negative review and will only play with friends =)"

so much scamming going on these Devs now feel their games are worth $200, when did we go from $50 game price to now HUNDREDS of dollars for a F$CKING GAME!!

i can by 10 seasons of a TV show for $80 but $100 for 1 title your out of your mind

												I love this game, but what Rockstar did with the summer sale broke my heart. I have friends who waited for this sale, waited for this game to go on sale specifically.

And what do you know! Day one, 25% off! But wait...what's this?

No it's not 25% off. It's a filthy lie. A manipulative trick to get you to buy 20 dollars worth of in game money, meaning in the end you save about a dollar fifty.

Again, I love GTAV, but until they do something to fix this shady buisness behavior, do not buy this game. It is not worth it. You can be better Rockstar, I know you can, come on."

												Long story short. For people who love GTA and want to play singleplayer only, this is for you. 
If you want to play online, you will probably get killed by hackers. And guess what? Rockstar does nothing about it. There is no simple way to report players, so your only options are to hope to find a good session without any hackers. Game itself 10/10, GTA Online 3/10 hackers everywhere...

--EDIT--
This is it...Decided to improve my flying skills, all of the sudden my character jumps off the plane (I didn't press anything), freezes and that's it. Can't move at all (Some sort of hack). Joined another session. After few minutes I noticed two people with godmode on, so I went passive mode. But guess what? They started shooting cars at me and I died about 10 times. I advice you not to buy this game at all."

Highly do not recommend, Rockstar wouldn't even respond with any type of explanation. I wish I could refund or even just give this game away because I'm so upset about their customer support. 

I will never purchase any of their products again, nor play any of their games online. There is no excuse for an ''accidental'' ban and deletion of assets, and then they treat the customer as if they are a cheating child with no explanation or even without providing any evidence.

												To start this off, I honestly love this game, its probably one of my favourite games of all time, but Rockstar really doesn't seem to care about its customers. I have over 350 hours in this game and have never used cheats a single time, but I was recently in a session with a hacker in which I recieved no money or anything from the hacker that could be used to get me banned, yet I was banned for no reason. My friend was also in the session and he asked if anybody in the session had reported me, the hacker responded saying he was trying to kill me earlier but I wasn't taking any damage and accused me of using God Mode, he admitted to reporting me for hacking, and without any evidence I got a 10 day ban. By now you would think Rockstar is at least trying to prevent this from happening."

												GTA V is a great game, a real achievement for the gaming industry. One of those games that deserves to be recorded, saved and displayed on a museum for all humanity. This is definitely the best version of the game, best graphics, FPS option, mods and etc. 


BUT (and this is a big but), the new anti-cheating mechanism, which was long overdue since cheating is rampant, is now generating a lot of false positives. That is, players that don't cheat or engage in illegal activities are being banned for one month without a specific reason. No one is really certain on what triggers this ban, some say Discord, Xplit, OBS and even Windows 10 Recording might be the culprit. As if that was not enough the worst part is the response from Rockstar, after the ban and you try to open a ticket to resolve the issue, they have already placed an automated response denying any form of contest. Like DONT EVEN TRY, NO ONE IS EVER GOING TO READ YOUR CLAIM.

This is completely ridiculous and a shame, and probably an unethical consumer stance. The game is really amazing and GTA Online is getting better content every month, unfortunately the customer service and the anti-cheating is a big stain on Rockstar’s track record...

If you buy this game now, you are running a big risk on getting a ban out of blue, and not being able to play it online. I would avoid it for the time being."

												***UPDATE 2016:
You think that by this time the cheater situation would be resolved?
EEEE!! You're wrong.. its as bad as before and its going downhill.

People no longer want to play Online aside from obvious script kiddies which there are majority of Online population now..
Legit players moved to Single Player and started playing with mods
which is a lot more fun and has a lot more depth without pointless grinding or dealing with cheating scumbags.. 

And rockstars didnt like that.. because more and more people stopped playing Online and moved to Single Player
They stopped releasing content for single player.

But that wasnt enough for them
they actualy had the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to release a script that blocks off ability to use online content in story mode (lowrider dlc cars spawned in Story Mode instantly got despawned) fortunately modders came up with the fix
but this is just the begining im afraid r* will most likely continue to ruin life for modders
company that once said that they support single player modding ... now are realeasing scripts to prevent from modding the game yeah...

developers of this game went ♥♥♥♥ing nuts over money they went same path Overkill and EA went
and they will now most likely continue to block off single player modding because no one wants to play their ♥♥♥♥ing bugged , riddled with cheaters dying online mode. 
Its all about shark cards BUY SHARK CARDS *middle finger* to the community

Do not buy
there is no point in buying this trainwreck of a game anymore if they continue towards this path of undermining modders and story mode players 
There is absolutely no point in getting the pc version

tho after this ""stunt"" i wouldnt buy any rockstar games at all
this was the last time i bought something from these EA wannabes

You have been warned

----------------------------------------
Game is really fun to play but getting it to run properly is a gamble 
1 wrong component or faulty software and you wont be able to play GTA 5 no matter what.

I was lucky i can play it and i enjoyed every second of it
However i cant recommend this game 
Why? Read below, here is how i rate this game:

Story mode 8/10

Online 1/10 : Hackers everywhere , every session has a hacker in it and they can do to you whatever they want kill you , crash your game , remove your vehicles/money , remove passive mode or even frame you for hacking (turn your character into a walking bomb that will kill everyone as if you killed them)

And Rockstar doesnt seem to handle the situation properly.. occasionaly they ban few of them for 2 weeks only. :/"

												I wish I could recommend this game. If you haven't played the story yet, it's good. I would pay $30 for the story. It isn't as good as 4, as the characters aren't as interesting, but the world presented is significantly more alive and fun to explore.

However I assume most have played the story by now, and if you haven't I assume  you're not interested. And it's Grand Theft Auto: Online that I do not recommend.

Beyond the 55 or so hours we got out of the singleplayer my playtime has, for the most part, been in secluded servers with my wife and friends, as we cannot stand the public in the this game - and if you have a group like that, 5-10 people to roam the map with without having to worry about the insecure manchildren that plague this game - it can be incredibly fun. However, that is not enough to recommend it. At this point I play because I already own it; I would not purchase this again. It only gets used because my wife plays with a friend.

That is because this game has the worst community of toxic players you will ever encounter. It isn't really moderated anymore, so you can expect people to act as they please with next to no apparent overwatch. And the anticheat? Its an absolute joke. I have friends who have received bans for ""hacks"" that I know they didn't use (I have known and been gaming together with several of them for 20+ years, they're above reproach) and yet the real hackers aren't banned or in most cases even kicked from the lobby. Use an overlay though, and you'll get banned so fast your head will spin - yes, that is right, Rockstar won't reverse a ban if a software overlay like a chat client pulls a false positive for hooking into the game. I can't tell you if it's true but there are more claims than I personally dismiss. 

After that ban call R*, I hear they even acknowledge false bans now without doing anything about it. What a great company. That is sarcasm... For those who may not know, R* customer support is legendary for how terrible it is. And they don't need to change their act. They are rolling in money.

And the worst thing of all? I suspect R* is directly lying to customers saying they aren't releasing Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC in the hopes that you'll run out and buy it on console and then later when they release it on PC you'll buy it again. Just like they double- and triple-dipped with the staggered releases of GTA5. R* has gotten too greedy; like any developer who gets this large you should generally avoid their products until they return to a more customer-oriented model for business. People need to remember that companies will only do what customers let them. Your purchasing power counts."

I had put in 400 hours into the game now rockstar has made me watse my money.

This has made very mad as i enjoyed playing GTA Online but now i have to start all over again at level 1 with nothing.

This is why I don't recommend this game as rockstar have ruined the expericane of the game for me and many others after wrongily Accussing me and other players all around the world"

												This is the home GTA V always deserved, but never got, until now.

Welcome home. We've all been waiting for you.


EDIT: After playing for a while I can attach a more informative review. Will update further when enough time is spent with the story and Online portion.

Performance-wise, the game runs relatively well on my GTX 680. I have suffered from an apparent memory leak bug that forces me to shut down the game, but it can be fixed by adding more virtual memory page file size (look it up on the internet). Aside from that, the launch has been relatively smooth for me.

The game world is full of detail. Put on sunglasses and you notice your vision is actually tinted. Park your bike in front of an entrance and a guy might shout you to move it. It's really the kind of benchmark-setting experience that makes other open world games look bland and lifeless.

In my opinion, the story and mission pacing are far steadier and faster than in GTA IV. 
Driving is a little bit better, hard to pinpoint exactly what makes it so, but to me it feels more responsive. Shooting can feel clumsy, especially in first-person, and the guns don't feel all that special, but it's still fun.

In addition to the updated graphics, the other PC-exclusive features include a custom radio station and the Rockstar Editor. Custom radio station is pretty simple. Add music files to a folder in the Documents, and you've got a Self Radio station in-game. It works, nothing more to add. 

As for the Rockstar Editor, it's really simple and fun to use. You mainly use markers to change cameras, apply effects, slow motion et cetera. I tested it for a bit and the end result is this:

(I'm planning to make longer and better videos in the near future)

The online feature can be a little bit confusing for new players to get into first, since it lacks direction, but you'll get it. Haven't played it too much to comment further, but it's fun to play jobs with friends, although the progression feels half-baked.

Thanks for reading my review. I'm planning to report on narrative and more of GTA Online soon."

												Another amazing Grand Theft Auto game. Ive been sticking with grand theft auto for 13 years or so now. Still remember the day i ran to the store to get GTA III for my ps2 in early 2003. Ive played all of them and now, including this one. Even tho for some its just a game, for me. Its become a tiny part of my past. Not to sound like a obessed gamer of some kind lol. 
Its just, if you follow a games developement for so long it becomes something special. Good old Grand Theft Auto :)

												600 hours. Great game. Came back on to have some fun with an old friend and to check out the new updates. We did some CEO missions and drove around, deciding not to bother the other players and do our own thing. I log off the game. Five minutes later i receive an email stating i have violated the EULA and my account, character, and inventory have all been reset. Years of work. Gone. I decided to give the game another chance after the same scenario had happened to my best friend before the reset was a thing, just to have it happen to me. Don't get me wrong, we had a blast driving around, grinding up enough money to finally buy the vehicles and homes we wanted, then proceed to try the new modes as they came out like the racing, CEO, adversary modes. I saw all these negative reviews on the page stating how people had been randomly banned, and when they brought this up on the forums, they were called ""liars"" and told ""Dont cheat again ♥♥♥"". I thought they were full of ♥♥♥♥ until it happened to me. I have no chance of getting all i've worked for back unless i buy their damn shark cards, and even then, whos to say they wont ban me again? I can say the uninstall button worked better than the anti-cheat, as ive seen countless modders roaming around unopposed, causing hell to other players. Im 90% sure that the majority of answers im going to get for this review are going to be the ""regulars"" who claim everyone hacks or cheats except them, and that i won't be missed. Thats fine. Just note Rockstar, if you by chance read my lovely review, you've lost another customer. I will never buy from you again. It was fun while it lasted but in the end, even i was beaten by a robot with the banhammer, with no reason, or ♥♥♥♥s given."

												Beautiful and awesome game, especially when playing with friends, but has non-existant customer support.
Hackers are everywhere and rockstar's system only seems to ban legit players, furthermore, they will not accept responsibility for this and will not unban you regardless if you have 100's of hours in game and/or have poured money into the P2W system.
It has one fo the most toxic communities out there, you can't drive anywhere without being obliterated by some dude who's hacked in a tank. The new update only encourages this by telling everyone in the session to kill anyone doing missions for minimal payout.
8/8 was a CEO and lost money to random hackers/greifers online, then got banned because having your internet drop out whilst customising a car is an attempted 'money glitch.'

All of rockstar's efforts and funds have been put into making money and trying to protect it with anti hacker systems so strict they ban regular players and not a decent support system or more interesting content.

EDIT

Rockstar's 1 month ban is now over, I contacted them multiple times through their ticket system and by phone to no avail so I waited it out. They also decided to remove the 2 mil I grinded for hours to get."

TL:DR at bottom

ONLY PURCHASE THIS GAME IF YOU INTEND TO PLAY SINGLEPLAYER

Single player lasts about 30 hours and ""GTA: Online"" is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.


INTRODUCTION

The single player story is great and all, but that's not why most people buy this game, they buy it for ""GTA: Online"".



EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE


GTA: Online wasn't always horrible, I'd say there was a time when it was actually fun. In it's current state, mostly everything in Online revolves around the ""Sharkcard"" the micro-transaction item that gives you in game money. All of the cool vehicles and houses/offices/gang buildings, are excessively expensive. In order to get the money required to purchase these items, you need to grind missions for hours on end. 

""Couldn't you just play Heists?""
Heists are great and all, but it's going to take a little more than 2 or 3 runs through the Pacific standard job to save up the ~6,000,000 dollars you need to purchase some of the newest vehicles.

""Why not just cheat the money in?""
A great way to move into the next point

BANNING

If you get banned, rockstar will never tell you why. Sure, maybe you know damn well why you were banned, but some people don't. Some people log into their game and have a permanent (or 20 year) ban on their account. And if these people who got randomly banned call rockstar support and ask why they got banned, and if they can get unbanned, they get the big middle finger.

STORY TIME

If you don't give a ♥♥♥♥, skip to the next asterisk border.
***************************************************
Playing dota 2 with a friend, friend's phone lights up. It's an email from rockstar support saying he violated the terms of service. 

Friend:""What?""

He launches GTA V and finds out that he's been banned for a month. With about 800 hours sank into the game, you could probably say he enjoys playing it. So he files a ticket on the rockstar support website and gets a cookie-cutter email 2 seconds later. Now upset, he contacts rockstar support via telephone.

Support: (Introduction: Hello, this is bill with rockstar support.... etc.)

Friend gives them all the information they want(Name, email, etc.)

Support: ""Alright, what do you need help with today""

Friend: ""I got randomly banned""

Support:(This is the email response, but most of the employees who work Customer support have a phrase similar to this memorised. My friend called several times and during the call asked if they had the phrase memorised, to which they replied either ""Yes"" or ""Mostly"".)

Thank you for contacting Rockstar Support. GTA Online bans are the result of automated analysis related to modding in GTA Online, exploiting or abusing game mechanics, or otherwise interfering with other players' gameplay experience. If you are banned from GTA Online, your ban expiration date is shown in the lowerleft corner after being returned to Story Mode following an attempt to play online. We generally do not overturn temporary bans nor can we guarantee individual responses to any temporary or permanent ban appeals however, we will review the evidence you submitted and take it into consideration. No further information is required from you at this time, and this ticket will close on its own.

(I'll refer to this as ""//Cookie-Cutter Response//"" from now on in order to save space.)

Friend:""Can I atleast know, why I'm banned?""

Suppport: Something along the lines of ""Our banning procedure is automatic and we cannot access why you were banned.""

Friend: ""Don't you think your automated process might mess up sometimes?""

Support: //Cookie-Cutter Response// (Except friend Interrupts support about halfway through)

Friend: ""So what you're saying is that your automated system is perfect and has no flaws whatsoever? And that I can just get banned when I'm not even playing the game?""

Support: Generic Apology that makes you feel like a toddler (You know the ones, the ""Sorry, not sorry."" apologies) 
 
Support: Addresses that bans can be a result of reports, and thus can happen when not playing the game.

Friend: Asks a few other things with no help and then gets transfered to someone else, He asked for a higher up, but I doubt he was actually given to someone ""higher up""
 
Support: Goes through generic intro and gets information from other customer support employee.

Support: ""Okay, and what was it you needed help with?""

Friend: ""I wanted to know if you could confirm that I'm actually banned for me and if you can figure out why.""

Support: Asks for social club ID, mishears the letter ""G"" as ""J"" and can't access the account.

Support: Asks for CD Key of game (This is tied to your steam account, and thus your social club ID)

Friend: Gives CD Key

Support: Apologizes for mishearing the letter ""G""

Support: ""Yes this social club account is banned from GTA: Online.""

Friend: ""Can you tell me why it was banned?""

Support: ""Everything here matches up.""

Friend: ""What matches up?""

Support: //Cookie-Cutter Response//

Friend(Interupting the //Cookie-Cutter Response//): Do you have that memorised?

Support: ""For the most part, you'd be suprised how many people call in with issues relating to bans.""

Friend: ""So you can't help me with my ban?""

Support: ""No, and if there's nothing else I can help you with, I'm going to have to let you go.""

Friend: ""So I'm just screwed? What if this happens again? I got the one month ban this time, What happens when I get randomly banned and it's permanent?""

Support: Something along the lines of //Coookie-Cutter Response//

Friend doesn't interupt this time

Support asks if he needs help with anything, friend says ""no"".

Support: ""Thank you for calling rockstar support, have a nice day.""

Friend: ""Thanks for nothing.""

I'll give you one guess as to what happened one or two months later to spark this review.

A good buddy of mine(Not the friend in the story) starts steam messaging me. Haven't talked to him in ~6 or 7 months. Says he's going to buy GTA V. He does it, installs it. My Good buddy, My Friend and I boot up GTA Online. 


My friend is permanently banned from GTA Online.


***************************************************************


Nobody likes cheaters, the guy who drives around and shoots everyone with his explosive pistol. Those guys need to be banned. What about the guy who spawns money on himself and others? Well, there's no doubt he's ""Impeding Shark-Card sales"", so ban him. What about the guy who got money dropped on him? Lucky you, rockstar already answered this question, they said they wouldn't.
However, it's speculated that you can get banned for selling cars that you buy with money that gets dropped on you. It's also speculated that using some of these programs will get you banned.


	
	
		[SAFE] HOW TO PREVENT FROM GETTING BAN FOR NO REASON [ONLINE IS SAFE NOW] [THREAD CLOSED] 
		A Guide for Grand Theft Auto V
		By: Original Protonium Egg
		
			for those scared to play gta online after the latest patch 7/6/16 GTA Online: Further Adventures in Finance and Felony .here is the exposed rockstar detection that i do some research...enjoy and sorry for bad english...		
	



Notice how all the ban reasons are speculated. This is because rockstar doesn't tell people why they get banned. Having 800 hours on a game and not logging in after a major update out of fear of being permanently banned is stupid. But it's what people have to do. That or get banned and have to go spend 60 dollars on another copy of gta v
______________________________________


TL:DR

To conclude, random bans happen and rockstar won't explain them. Only buy for single player. The random ban is constantly floating over your head. Rockstar support sucks.

More ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t: Each update, breaks almost every single existing mod, and adds even more confusion in modding community.Also, ♥♥♥♥♥tar, it's not that hard to add a separate .exe for online, to stop the cheaters. Stop being idiots.

And here we go again, update. Now Rockstar bans modders that actually helped to sell the game, the ones who did their own multiplayer THAT REQUIRED LEGIT COPY of the game, they banned their accounts, and now they cant play this game, or the other games they owned that are using R* Social club.

Goooood job, Rockstar. My reccomendation: Go ♥♥♥♥ing pirate it.

And update: Rockstar FULLY Shut down FiveM, great job digging your own grave, R*."

Online is near enough an utter grindfest for newer players and the commuinity is utter cancer, full of cheaters, children and angry pre teens that have invested more time and cash into shark cards than they have into their education as it comes to when a salty russian corrects a british child on his/her's spelling.

The anti cheat is utter garbage, false positives everywhere banning innocent players and letting cheaters roam free. You'd think with all that money they could have hired a better online security team.

If Rockstar listened to their commuinity (which they never have done really as they're still rolling in last year's sales report) perhaps this game can have another chance with me.


TL:DR
Single player: Fantastic alone, even better with mods.
Online: Avoid like the plauge, unless you have some sort of sexual fettish for getting shouted at and wasting your money.

Edit: I am aware of the fanboys mass disliking this review as well as the same people in question commenting on my profile because apparantly I'm not allowed an opinion online because I dislike a segment of a popular video game. Grow up children."

												Pre-ordered this game straight away when it first came to steam. Been playing it back and forth for 330 hours total. I had a ton of fun playing with friends and just doing stuffs online. Then all of a sudden i got a ban after i got the X80 Prot car (Or whatever it's called). A 1 week ban. I made a ticket and got a automatic bot reply. Waited for the ban to disappear to go in again. Then I notice all my money is gone (they wipe your account when you get a ban) so I started playing a heist with my brother and some friends. On the last part of the heist, I got another ban for 1 month. I still don't know what it is I am doing that's against their rules. I make 4 tickets in hope of getting a reason for my ban and all I get are bot replies. After a while, I manage to do a ticket with the title ""connectivity issues"" and explained that I was afraid to log in cus I didn't want another ban, and this time, I get a reply from a person. This person said ""we do not know the reason since it's a bot that's banning people"" and calmly said ""but you shouldn't be afraid to log in."". I trusted this guy so I logged in after my 1 month ban and managed to play for a day. HOWEVER on the next day I started playing, I got a PERMANENT ban and I still have NO clue whatsoever what I got banned for. Talked with some guys in a GTA group and they said I will most likely not get unbanned. *NOTE* I was NOT modding, cheating or abusing anything in the game at all. Pure vanilla version of the game. *END NOTE*

The Game is very fun to play with friends, BUT their anti cheat system bans people for nothing and the Support gives no ♥♥♥♥ whatsoever to help or explain what might be the issue.

If you can look past the risk of getting randomly banned and having cheaters nuking you anywhere in the world, then you might have a good time. I don't recommend it cus I think Rockstar don't deserve the money when they clearly don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about their community."

												After 1380 hours ingame, mostly online, never cheated, always hated and reported the cheaters in GTA I got banned for 1 month with absolutely no reason. I didnt even unknowingly got money by standing afk and getting money dropped on me. I mostly played in private sessions or ""low populated"" lobbies because of all the annoying 10 year old internet warriors.

I grinded so much, soooo much and enjoyed almost every aspect of the game, gameplay mechanics especially. Meaning, I was a loyal ""customer"" to this game, to Rockstar, and as respons in my ticket asking why I got banned I didnt even get a correct answer, ""youre banned"" and it's final. They ban people for no reason!!!!!!!!!!!

Last big hammer wave was a few months ago, and coincidentally short after that, the game was on sale. Shady eh.

Sadly, even though GTA is a great serie and the ideas they had for GTAV were really nice, I cannot recommend this game anymore. Come on, they ban ppl for no reason and RESET EVERYTHING you have earned, that's enough said."

												Don't get me started on GTA Online. It's only matter of time before R* closes solo session and private session or pays troller more by successfully annoy other player (Crate delivery, Import / Export, you know it) or probably makes the game itself harder by applying more sh*tty policies and such (No garage access during Pacific Heist, etc. CMIIW) w/ purpose to punish players more while playing it or force players to buy Shark Cash Cards instead just heavy grinding in specific heists or side missions, hell IDK...

Aside from being exaggerating, don't buy this game. Hell even just for enjoying Story Mode - it's not worth it for $50 price tag (Wait till it discounted like around 66% - 75%)"

												Don't buy this game until Rockstar gets off their asses and fixes the ridiculous amount of bugs they still haven't touched since launch.

The game takes 12 hours to download on a good machine and crashes ten or twenty minutes for no reason. The online mode is full of hackers who kill everyone repeatedly and will even try to get you banned from the game by spawning you money. I don't have access to half of the map because the game will crash if you drive too far north.

Don't bother reporting any bugs to Rockstar, they have some of the worst customer service I've ever seen. Take the crashes for example, I've seen hundreds of posts about this problem and Rockstar either ignores them or tells the poster to buy a better computer. This is obviously a huge problem that happens to many players and Rockstar hasn't even touched it yet.

Don't get me wrong, this is a good game when it works, a really good game. But the fact that Rockstar has ignored so many game breaking issues experienced by such a huge portion of their fanbase makes me think that Rockstar just doesn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥.

By the way, nice thing you pulled with the summer sale Rockstar!"

												So there I was at 12am in the morning. I remember the great times I've had on console, so I buy GTA V for $30. It takes me four hours to download the massive 70gb game. I start GTA Online and start to drive around in a car and terrorize the civilians. After an hour of gameplay I decide to go to sleep.

When I wake up I see an email from Rockstar. ""Rockstar Games Account Suspension and Character Reset Notification"" (which was an email sent by them 50mins after i stopped playing). I remember looking at the reviews about the game and seeing people complain that they've been mysteriously banned for no reason. 

So I think about the situation. I just bought the game, I just gave these people my money, I played for maybe a little more than an hour of GTA Online, AND NOW IM BANNED. 

Have I ever exploited the game with any malicious programs? NO I LITERALLY JUST BOUGHT THE GAME FOR $30 ON MY MAIN ACCOUNT (WHICH IS CLEAN).

Also to make it just all that much better, these people don't give you any information as to why you were banned, they just tell you that you have violated their rules and tell you how long you're banned for.

So in the Rockstar support pages it says that 3rd party applications don't cause bans in GTA Online. Yea right. 

SO WHAT COULD IT BE?! Could it be that I said one thing in chat which consisted of ""hi guys."" Could it be that I shot civilians and ran from the police? Could it be that I slightly damaged another player's car when I rear-ended it? Nope, i guarantee it isn't any of those things.

These people have made billions off of GTA V, so why would they care about my petty $30? 

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. YOU ARE GUARANTEED A BAN.

These people are too lazy to actually do anything about their rotting reputation.

Seriously please do not buy the game guys it seriously makes you feel worthless and degraded. To explain my story hopefully a little better. I bought GTA V for $30 off of Steam because I remember the fun times I had on console. It takes so many hours to download and once it's done I am excited. After the prologue, I head into GTA Online because it's my first experience on pc. In summary, I shot civilians, stole cars, ran from the cops, typical GTA stuff, I didn't PVP. 

To convice you others that I am a legitimate player, this is my main steam account. This is my first time playing GTA Online on the computer. Why would I waste $30 on my MAIN account just to hack a game? AND why would I spend quite a long time writing this review if I were an actually cheater?

CONCLUSION I realize that I have actually violated Rockstar's agreements. To play GTA V without being randomly banned you must ensure that your computer doesn't have any programs Rockstar doesn't like? In my case it could've just been cheat engine sitting on my computer, not running. GTA V is a great game, but Rockstar's auto ban system seems faulty to me but that's just my opinion."

												The singleplayer is excellent as well as the multiplayer portion of the game when you are playing with friends doing jobs and heists and having a fun time messing around in the open world of Los Santos. Everything else is a freaking mess. If the grind doesn't get you, then be prepared to meet the community. One side are the legit hackers that ruin the game with their God Mode and one shot everything in their path with merely peashooters. On another side will be griefers that will do anything to give you a bad day in a public lobby. One another side would be the actual community whose toxicity is worse than the kids on either the CoD or BF community that fondles R*'s balls and blindly believes that all legit players that were falsely banned are hackers. There is no way to reason with them even though there is hard proof. A word of advice, either do a private lobby or grab some friends or trusted people (heh, as if that would apply to the majority of the GTA:O community)"

												Let me start at the beginning in order to accurately describe this atrocity that has happened to me a few months ago. Just now decided to write a review after seeing the same thing has happened to so many others. 

I bought GTAV on September 17th, 2013. I waited in the pre-order line at gamestop because I was so damn hyped for this game. I was only intending to play it on console until the PC version came out. At this point I had no clue that there was going to be character swaps from console to PC. I obtain level 72 on console. Loving the game, couldn't be happier (except if the radio stations were better).

PC version release date is announced sometime in January 2015. I immediately pre-order it in order to get the bonus money that was available as a pre-order incentive. Upon release I transfer my character from console to PC and recieve my pre-order money. I was so thrilled to finally be playing this great game on PC. In the last year I put in 390 hours online in this game and achieved level 136 if I recall correctly. Countless hours of heist grinding, job grinding, lots of shark cards bought. Sitting at something like 11million dollars. 2 houses, 2 garages. Everything I could ever want in the game. I had things that weren't even obtainable anymore. I was thrilled with where the game was going. Then.... I get bored; So I quit playing for 2 months.

A friend asks me, ""Hey come play GTA with me let's wreck some kids"". Sure why not. I get on for about an hour and we do just that, wreck some kids. I log off for the night and log in the next day to a 10 day ban. I was beyond baffled. How could I be banned when I didn't do anything? Surely rockstar support can help me. So I call in an attempt to figure out what is going on. I get fed a rehearsed line about bans being the result of online modding etc etc. I ask for a supervisor, the supervisor says the same thing. I ask for his supervisor. He says there is no one above him available and I was unable to appeal my ban. His reasons are as follows.
""Just accept the 10 day ban."" 
""If you weren't really doing anything then in 10 days you can play again and nothing will be lost, just take a break"". He neglects to tell me that the system was going to take all of my money and I would have to start over. Grinding countless heists/jobs or buy a large sum shark card (which is ultimately what they wanted me to do).

I come back around 12 days later and play for a few hours. Nothing out of the ordinary happens. I then got off for the night. The following day I got back on and was banned again. This time for 30 days. I think to myself ""No &*%#ing way, this isn't possible"". I call AGAIN and get the same rehearsed line AGAIN from both the first and second level of support (always ask for a supervisor). Except this time something was different. This time I was being allowed to appeal my ban. I thought for sure I would be exonerated of these allegations. Nope. I was told that I must have been hacking if their skynet system banned me. That there is nothing they can do and that ""evidence of illicit activity"" was found on my account. So I ask them to check again and they do. Same result. 

At this point I start thinking ahead. ""What happens when I get back from this 30 day ban?"". ""I'm just going to be banned again for the same false reason?""
They reply, ""that shouldn't happen sir"". I reply, ""Shoulda coulda woulda. It's happened twice now so what makes next time any different. No variables have changed. If I record all of my gameplay from now on will that protect me? If I am indeed banned upon return to your game can I use the footage as proof of my innocence?""
""Yes"", I was told. Not maybe, not ""we're not sure"". I was told ""Yes, that will suffice"".
So I did just that. I recorded all of my gameplay. Unfortunately ""all"" only ended up being roughly 2 hours the night I was unbanned after the 30 day ban because I was immediately banned permanently after logging off for that night.

This is starting to get a little longer than I expected so I'll cut it short. I tried to appeal the permament ban. I thought ""I have video that I didn't do anything, surely this time it will be different.... they will have to unban me"". NOPE.
I'll just end my review here and link my evidence. The videos of my gameplay and their final reply to me in my appeal where I linked them the videos.

 TL;DR: ROCKSTAR CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE AND IF YOU BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL BE BANNED BY SKYNET SIMPLY FOR BEING IN THE SAME LOBBY AS A SCRIPTER (WHICH WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN). 

Edit: According to various sources (denied by Rockstar when I called them today) I was banned for MSI Afterburner/RivaTuner. This would make sense to me now that I think about it. However my review remains unchanged because they are doing absolutely nothing to fix the issue. I was told that I am not allowed to appeal my permanent ban because their system is flawless and does not falsely ban people for any reason. The support supervisor (Kyle) even acknowledged that he had heard of the MSI/Riva complaint but that it was ""false"". So yeah I'm still in the same place I started. Still will never support another Rockstar game for as long as I live."

WHAT KIND OF LOGIC IS THAT? YOU CAN'T APPEAL BANS?

the anti-cheats not even good... countless cheaters online. every update halts them for... a few days max?

sigh.

edit for clarification: 

- The game is grindy, but in my opinion fun. Solo play is rough, though.
- The community is overall pretty bad.
- This entire review is only based off of online. I played maybe 2 hours of Singleplayer. I know it is a good game, but not my cup of tea.

edit 2: my ban has expired and a few friends helped me earn a few million with heists, still stand by the negative review and will only play with friends =)"

												I can't recommend this right now because of the scummy business practices that Rockstar are currently employing. As you have probably read, it is impossible to get a real 'discount' on the game as they have decided to instead bunch it together with a shark card leaving the game with no real discount. Not only does mean that the game isn't really on a discount, it also means that you probably won't be able to refund it in case something goes wrong or if you change your mind because of the unrefundable micro transaction along with it. I preorded this game before it came out, but for players who do not currently own it and are considering it, I would probably wait until this is over. Hopefully Rockstar will see how angry the Steam community is about this and sort it out. Until then, I would suggest waiting. The game itself is enjoyable for the most however, but I can't suggest it until Rockstar sort this out."

												***UPDATE 2016:
You think that by this time the cheater situation would be resolved?
EEEE!! You're wrong.. its as bad as before and its going downhill.

People no longer want to play Online aside from obvious script kiddies which there are majority of Online population now..
Legit players moved to Single Player and started playing with mods
which is a lot more fun and has a lot more depth without pointless grinding or dealing with cheating scumbags.. 

And rockstars didnt like that.. because more and more people stopped playing Online and moved to Single Player
They stopped releasing content for single player.

But that wasnt enough for them
they actualy had the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to release a script that blocks off ability to use online content in story mode (lowrider dlc cars spawned in Story Mode instantly got despawned) fortunately modders came up with the fix
but this is just the begining im afraid r* will most likely continue to ruin life for modders
company that once said that they support single player modding ... now are realeasing scripts to prevent from modding the game yeah...

developers of this game went ♥♥♥♥ing nuts over money they went same path Overkill and EA went
and they will now most likely continue to block off single player modding because no one wants to play their ♥♥♥♥ing bugged , riddled with cheaters dying online mode. 
Its all about shark cards BUY SHARK CARDS *middle finger* to the community

Do not buy
there is no point in buying this trainwreck of a game anymore if they continue towards this path of undermining modders and story mode players 
There is absolutely no point in getting the pc version

tho after this ""stunt"" i wouldnt buy any rockstar games at all
this was the last time i bought something from these EA wannabes

You have been warned

----------------------------------------
Game is really fun to play but getting it to run properly is a gamble 
1 wrong component or faulty software and you wont be able to play GTA 5 no matter what.

I was lucky i can play it and i enjoyed every second of it
However i cant recommend this game 
Why? Read below, here is how i rate this game:

Story mode 8/10

Online 1/10 : Hackers everywhere , every session has a hacker in it and they can do to you whatever they want kill you , crash your game , remove your vehicles/money , remove passive mode or even frame you for hacking (turn your character into a walking bomb that will kill everyone as if you killed them)

And Rockstar doesnt seem to handle the situation properly.. occasionaly they ban few of them for 2 weeks only. :/"

												If this game was split into two Steam hubs for the Single Player and the Multiplayer, the SP would have a 99% positive and the Multiplayer would look like No Man's Sky. It is an excellent single player game, but mimics a trash and cash-grabby freemium game for multiplayer. It seems like Rockstar only sees their players as wallets.

The lowest price this game has gone for is $30, so wait until then. When you do, just stick to single player. For a good open world multiplayer experience, head elsewhere. 

Cons first, pros second.

Cons

Rockstar intentionally designed their online ecosystem to be like a cash-grabby mobile game. You are able to own property, vehicles, etc. However, you have to earn currency by playing similar grindy missions/heists or competitions. This seems great in concept, but the numbers are intentionally designed to make you feel like it would be easier to just ""buy"" the in-game currency with real money. Also, if you come from the single player, you get much less cash in general, so you are getting less money than you are ""used to"", which contributes to the aforementioned psychological pressure. Yes, you can theoretically get it all with time spent in-game, but this is similar to the League of Legends IP model in which the time spent per money acquired is so low that you are constantly pressured to just spend the real money. This sort of constant pressure does not make for an enjoyable gaming experience.

There are superfluous accounts of Rockstar refusing to appeal any bans for online play. The ban-worthy offenses include but are not limited to: using any overlays, recording software, voice chat software such as Discord, etc etc. Oh, and make sure to hell that you don't EVER mod the single player, because that'll get you banned in multiplayer too! (maybe this is why Bethesda doesn't do multiplayer?)

Let's also not mention that some hackers can appear in your public games (because you can't do these grindy missions by yourself) and just spawn money over your head. You can go jump through a bunch of hoops to try to get rid of that ""hacked"" cash, but even the fact  that this is possible is ludicrous. 

How on earth are you supposed to prepare so much for all of these detrimental nuances? No one should have to be this scared and pensive to just play multiplayer normally, but it primarily exists as a cash grab to support the ""free"" DLC that Rockstar releases (which you need to acquire with in-game currency, of course). 

If you get banned, you will get ignored. Rockstar already made their money off of you, so who cares.

Rockstar also has a history of greed by refusing to put the game on sale during Steam sales. They instead will lump the game at the reduced price and throw the ""Shark cash"" in with the, so it is tough to find it below 60 bucks. You probably won't want to play multiplayer anyway. 


Pros

This is one of THE best single player games I've ever played. The over-world has an astounding amount of detail and nuance, the content is ample, the characters and story are interesting, and a lot of the mechanics are fun to use. The story is surprisingly deep and is on par with a gang/mafia style movie. One of the things that Rockstar has understood about GTA is that making the driving/traversing around the world fun makes everything else fall into place, and this game is the best in the series at it. Sometimes you just want to drive around and go sight-seeing, which is extremely fun. 

As a PC port, it exceeds expectations. This game is proof that it is always worth it to wait for a PC port (most recent example being Final Fantasy XV), as long as the developer makes sure to do it well. Uncapped framerate, resolutions, lots of options for optimization, etc. The rendering distance is great, and it's very easy to see most of the distinct features of a landscape at a long distance. 

One of my main complaints is that hitting a high vehicle speed can make the rendering suffer a bit, but it's not a big deal."

												Rockstar has a no questions asked ban policy and thousands of upset players who were permanently barred from online play thanks to false-positlives, discord overlays, MSI Afterburner, changing the FoV, the list goes on. Online play isn't even Grand Theft Auto anymore, it's economics simulator. You are forced to buy cars and store them in your garage instead of just stealing them, each new update brings inflation to in-game currency yet Sharkcards remain the same price. If you spend $100 on a Shark Card you can buy one vehicle and the required garage from the new update. Cannot recommend the game, Rock$tar is no longer interested in customer satisfaction, only customer churn. The latest ban-wave came literally two days before the game went on sale. Say no to predatory business practices."

												The game is so-so. While it's the magnum opus GTA, the pc port is a bit of hit&miss. I, for one, have heavy graphical bugs whenever it rains.

Also, going to have to give it a negative review for bumping the price up and then pretending it was on a generous summer sale. Seriously, doesn't gaming industry have a single bit of ethics left anywhere?"

												GTA V is a hit-or-miss game. The greatness shines in the singleplayer with its amazing and flamboyant narrative, good character development, and well-written dialogue. I would certainly recommend buying the game purely for the story mode - at a discount of course. I don't think it's worth the $59.99 price tag as it is. If you're a fan of a good crime narrative, GTA V is definitely the game for you.

Perhaps the weakest element of GTA V is the online mode. Most of the reviews here are complaining about the modders, hackers, false bans, and griefing players who ruin the experience for other players, which is quite true. However, let's dive into the more fundamental elements of the online mode's overall design structure. This review will be mainly about the online experience, as Rockstar continues to update the game's online sessions with new adversary modes and DLC today.  If you're buying the game solely for the online experience, exercise caution. 

 DESIGN : In a nutshell, GTA V's online design is nothing short of awful. The menus are incredibly cluttered with lists upon lists of jobs (mission, races, stunt races) to do, and some of them don't show up. If you want to do a mission, you'll need to scroll through menus of needless tabs just to get to your specific mission unless you bookmark it. If you want to do missions with your friends, you'll need to go through multiple loading screens to start them. Loading back to free-roam takes a few minutes. 

Matchmaking is some of the worst I've seen in an online experience; it can take anywhere from one to fifteen minutes to gather a group of 2-4 players together to do any mission. When the game actually does pair you up with someone else - assuming you don't have many friends who play the game - it is with literally any player with any skill level. The game will sometimes pair a high-level player with most of the weapons and rewards unlocked with a low-level player with most of the weapons locked, often causing the job to fail due to player inexperience. Invites sometimes don't reach your friends, glitches with menus occur, and there are still many gamebreaking bugs that prevent the online mode from being a decent experience. 

If you're a fresh player just joining GTA V Online, good luck - most of the weapons are locked behind a level requirement. It will take you weeks to months to gain enough reputation to get the weapon you want - rocket launchers, grenade launchers, explosives, etc. Rockstar can also dish out permanent bans regardless of behavior, and you cannot appeal them. In summary, don't anger Rockstar.

 AI : Very unforgiving. At times, the AI will be perfectly cunning, dodging and weaving around obstacles to gun you down where you stand. During missions and heists however, most of them are unfair. They never seem to miss; they always have their reticles glued to you, so the moment you pop your head out to return fire, they quickly whittle away what little health you have. 

You can restore health in combat with snacks - purchased from convenience stores around Los Santos in free roam/freemode. If you want to heal when you're being gunned down by police, mercenaries, or gangsters, you guessed it; you need to open your interaction menu, scroll down to inventory, scroll down to snacks, and spam the enter key to heal your character, then exit the menu to resume combat. Run out of snacks or armor during a mission? You will need to quit to freemode, drive to another convenience store - or CEO office - and restock them. Buy too much and the convenience store will run out of snacks, forcing you to drive to another convenience store to buy more. How inconvenient.

The AI isn't easy at all online, and requires precise movements, well-stocked equipment and health, and pure luck to beat them down.

 JOBS : Some online jobs - similar to quests in an RPG - require you to have more than 2 players. If you start a solo session or an invite only session, most of the fun jobs are all closed off, with Rockstar prompting you to join a public session with other unpredictable players in the lobby, because Rockstar wants the playerbase to mingle. In hindsight, it might seem like a great way to connect with other players, but with the hit-or-miss community of ""public lobby"" GTA V Online coupled with matchmaking flaws, it's difficult to get anything done.

Want to do a heist? You are required to gather 4 players together to do them. Individual heist setups can take anywhere from 5-20 minutes. If you fail a heist setup? Moreoften, you may restart from a checkpoint and try it again. If a player leaves the heist setup? Everyone fails the mission, and the party leader will need to exit to freemode, go back to their apartment, re-initiate the heist, and find 4 new players, rinse and repeat. Heist finales contain the highest payouts, with rewards spanning from $80,000 to $200,000 depending on the heist, and can range anywhere between 10-30 minutes to complete. There are rarely checkpoints in heist finales; players have team lives instead of individual lives. If one player dies, your team loses a life, and in 99% of the heist finales, only one team life is available. Therefore, if one player continues to die and uses up your team's lives, you will need to replay the entire heist finale from the beginning or checkpoint. If one player leaves or disconnects while the heist is in progress, you will need to gather another 4 players to do the heist finale from the start. 

 PLAYERBASE : GTA V Online's playerbase is really a hit or miss, though they should be somewhat feared. There are some decent and friendly players who are looking to have fun with heists, rewards, and such, but the majority of the time you'll be killed the moment you leave your apartment - run over by cars, sniped from afar, etc; this can be combatted with the game's passive mode - a mode in which other players cannot attack you, and you cannot attack other players or pedestrians. The problem with this mode is that you can't rob stores, take part in public lobby events, or defend yourself when the cops begin pursuing you.

Also, there doesn't appear to much of a localization option with other players; you are grouped together with players from around the world. God forbid you get paired up in a serious heist where communication is next to impossible due to a language barrier. 50% of the time, you'll luckily encounter an English-speaking player. Most of the other players are from other countries, which makes coordinating missions and jobs frustrating if you or others don't speak a common language.

 DLC/BUSINESS MODEL : The game's online items and cars are progressively getting more and more expensive. Super/hypercars cost upwards of $1,000,000 to $6,000,000. There is a plane in-game for $10,000,000. Luxury yachts go from $6,000,000 to $10,000,000. CEO offices go from $1,000,000 to $6,000,000. Apartments go anywhere from $40,000 to $2,000,000. If you're earning $10,000 per job, and about $80,000 per heist in a great while, you bet it will take a long time to buy the things you want. Rockstar releases ""free DLC"" every few months, which are nothing more than introductions of new vehicles and buildings with inflated price tags. Don't want to play the game to earn money? Simply buy shark cards. $20 USD gets you 1.2 million dollars. $100 USD gets you 8 million dollars. And Rockstar wonders why modders and money hackers grow by the minute. The business model with ""free DLC"" is simply a hellish sanctuary for micro-transactions. You're not buying a $60 game. You're conned into paying for a $500+ game; that is, unless you either grind out every bit of cash slowly, or stay the heck away from online.

Overall? Beautiful story. Story mode gets  9/10. Greedy Rockstar in online mode. Bad design, mixed playerbase, unfair AI, disappointing rewards, but fun with friends. Online gets a  4/10."

												Things I Have Never Done in GTA Online:
- Used Hacks in Any Form
- Modded the Game (Single or Multiplayer)
- Been Given Hacked Money
- Asked for Hacked Money
- Glitched or Used Exploits 
- Cheated or Abused the Game
- Had any Software Installed that has been known to Interfere with Cheat Detection

Things I Have Done: 
- Paid for GTAV on two platforms
- Spent over 350hours playing GTAOnline across two platforms
- Rarely spent any time in Public GTAOnline Sessions
- Bought all Previous Rockstar Games and Loved them

So in early December 2016 I was grinding hard in GTAOnline during a slow week. I had decided to set myself goal of earning enough money through CEO Jobs and Biker Work to buy a Super Yacht. After a few days of grinding I logged on and found I had been banned. I checked my email and found an agressively vague non-spesific email telling me I had violated Rockstars EULA and I had been banned from GTAOnline for one month.

At first I was fairly okay with this, it was one month, and sometimes these things happen. Then I found out that I had my character stats, profile, money and assets wiped out. So I left a ticket on Rockstar social club querying this and attemping to appeal the ban and got back a generic reply that I had violated the EULA and the ban is final. 

I have spent the last month sending in tickets, asking different questions trying to at the very least pinpoint what my violation of the terms of service was. I have yet to recieve anything except identical replies, all giving me the exact same vague information that I had violated the EULA and had been banned and that all bans were final. I tried calling up Rockstar technical support (which I only found the phone number for my country on Reddit - thanks to who ever posted that), and the person on the phone read me the EXACT same reply I got by email and then proceeded to hang up. 

At the very least Rockstar has some horrible customer service. At worst, they are deliberately obstructing and willfully ignoring the compaints of paying customers. No automated ban system is flawless, and prior to this I would have agreed that people claiming false bans are just whining cheaters. But now I believe that there is at least a minority of banned players who have been banned for no valid reason, have had hours upon hours of gameplay wiped and have no recourse to appeal the bans. There are victory stories from before Rockstar updated their ban policy mid-2016 when people had been able to appeal the bans due to false-positives, and this at least shows that the automated ban system is flawed. 

Let me be clear: I couldn't even find out what I did to earn the ban, let alone be given the chance to refute it. 

---
So: if you want this game for singleplayer, go for it. It's good. Story isn't as tight as GTAIV but the gameplay has improved greatly. But if you want to buy GTAV for Online only, think twice; because you may end up having hundreds of invested hours wiped out for no apparent reason, and have no way to even appeal or find out why."

												 My Experience With Rockstar Support 
   Well, as you may pick up from the title, anybody posting about experience with support is most likely posting something negative. This is most definitely true.

   I begin my story, 2 days ago, playing GTA 5 - Online and having some fun with friends. Since I'm slightly impatient I decided to purchase a $10 shark card to assist me in getting me started up. Purchased some weapons, vehicle, upgrades, all that jazz. The next day I start up the game only to see that I have been banned with no explanation as to why I have been banned.

   Of course, I move onto the support website. I submit a support ticket explaining my issue and get a response back within minutes of posting the ticket. I was impressed!! Such fast response times!!

   Just kidding, it was just an automated response explaining that bans are automated and they can't do anything about it. So then I decided to call. 51 calls just to get into the waiting line, 47 minute hold, brief explanation of myself, and another 7 minute hold all to be told the same ♥♥♥♥ the automated system on the website told me.

   I still have no idea as to why I was banned. Never hacked. Never modded. Never abused anybody. Thank you support for literally wasting my time.

Other than the stupid banning of innocent people, including a friend of mine who has been temp banned twice now and will be perma banned on the next one, it's fun with friends.

 Verdict 
Would I recommend it? If you can avoid being perma banned by a broken automated system, sure I would, but I can't say that is possible.

/Ijustneededtovent /endrant

EDIT: This was originally a reddit post, when I state 2 days ago, I really mean a while ago.
EDIT 2: To all those saying ""just shut up, you cheated admit it, stop lying"" you clearly either haven't played long enough or consistent enough to have the broken automated system touch you in inappropriate places, or you are just that one special snowflake that is so ignorant to all the evidence of false-positives.

												Would have easily recommended this game before Steam's 2015 Summer sale--fantastic game, incredibly immersive, tons of fun--but sadly I won't be recommending any Rockstar games anymore.

The company essentially bundled in-game cash DLC with the base game, raised the price of the bundle to $80, and marked the bundle 25% off so that it sold ""on sale"" for the regular base price of $60. On top of this, Rockstar (initially) pulled the base game from their store page, which made it seem like the cash card bundle was the only version of the game you could purchase (effectively hiding the fact that the base game is not actually on sale).

To top everything off though, purchasing the cash card bundle is basically Rockstar's way of skirting around Steam's new refund policy. Buying the bundle and starting up the game immediately ties the cash card to your account, which disqualifies you from requesting a refund even if you play the game for less than two hours. It's a ♥♥♥♥ move. I'm just disappointed I've already given Rockstar my money. Wish I could get it back.

Won't be buying another Rockstar game anytime soon."

												Price jacked up for ""sale"". The port is good and I had thought they had redeemed themselves into the PC market since GTA4 was a disaster but this cash grab is the last straw for me. I'd request a refund if I was eligible. They can't keep on taking and taking from us and giving nothing in return. We the consumer are being taken for granted.

We shouldn't be giving our hard earned money to developers like this, if you really want to spend this sort of money on a game then chuck in another couple of quid and buy Witcher 3 where the developer really does care about its consumer. Witcher 3 is worth every single penny."

												TLDR; It's not worth it. Not for the single Player, not for the Multiplayer. Don't give Rockstar money for this game. 

As other reveiws and countless articles have shown, Rockstar does not listen to the playerbase. The anti-Cheat just doesn't work.

 I've been permanently banned from all of GTA Online without ever going into a public server. All I've done is join a friends private, invite only session. This was the first time I logged into GTA online, I should add. 

So, I call up Rockstar support. I explain my issue. 

""It seems like our Anti Cheat engine flagged you on accident, since it has no reason why."" 

 ""Wonderful. When do you think I can play again?"" 

""Bans can't be appealed or removed.""

""You just said that I was falsely banned."" 

""Yes Sir."" 

""And... I'm going to still be banned. ""

""Yes Sir. If that is all, you can fill out a small questionaire about how we helped you today!"" 

Oh.. You bet I filled that puppy out. Again. Don't buy this game. The single player is good, but not worth the issues you WILL have with rockstar."

So you know, if you wanna have online fun, look for something else.

												Come for the story mode, leave for the online filled with hackers.


Edit: It seems as though R* Has finally stepped up their detection for the moment and online is nowhere near as bad as the first 4-5 months. So If you are just now getting into online, be glad you didn't live through the hell that was online mode.

Edit2: I deiced to give GTA5 Online another shot after a 5 month break, First game I joined I, along with everyone else, was blown up by one player at the same time. My review stands as negative. Rockstar clearly does not care for it's community but instead; their wallets."

***FINAL EDIT ???*** Permanently banned today. I am very surprised and never saw this coming /sarcasm. Why would I be complaining for months about my bans, but continue to cheat and get banned? 1002 hours played over the years, not a single cheating infraction until 2 months ago, when their anti-cheat was updated. Bans within weeks of each other since then. Hmmm, seem legit.

***EDIT #200: I contacted Rockstar support online 3 time. Each time they were unable to verify my claim. I called their support (1800-601-237 for Australia) and the guy I spoke to wasn't able to verify my claim. That's 4 people who couldn't verify my claim. I asked to speak to the supervisor, who finally COULD VERIFY MY CLAIM. That's right, you actually have to look into the problem to verify it. These people are incompetent duds. But at least I got my $4.8 million back.***

***EDIT: My third ban finished, but they took all my legitimate money. $4,800,000 that I farmed for hours, doing Pac Standard, stolen from me. For reference, to buy $3,500,000 from Rockstar it costs $50. Rockstar have stolen $70 worth of in-game currency from me. They shut down support tickets. They say they're auditing my account, but they never get back to me. If you know of anyone or any place I can contact to help me out, please let me know.***

I've left the old review below, but I'm writing a more in-depth one since I've been through a lot of ♥♥♥♥.

About a week before the Finance and Felony update, I started up GTA Online to kill some time. Played around for about an hour, then went out. About 2 hours later I got an email saying I was banned.

I played as I normally would, never used mods in single player or online etc. etc. Created many support tickets, which were all instantly closed. TOP TIP: If you want to send them a ticket regarding a ban, file it under 'bug report'. This guarantees a human will look at it, at the very least. Filing it under anything to do with a ban will auto-solve it and get you an automated message telling you to ♥♥♥♥ off. Good support.

So 10 days pass, no reply. My ban was over exactly the day Finance and Felony came out, so I played it for a bit. They'd taken all my money, ~$15,000,000. Some was given to me by a modder, most notably I got a very large sum by beating a random person in a point-to-point race (~$10,000,000 instantly for winning). My money was reset to $20,000.

TOP TIP #2: You don't get banned for receiving or using modded money. Only by being a cheater. Google it if you don't believe me, there's a post by Rockstar Games on their support forums.

About 2 hours later, I was banned again. 1 month this time.

At this point, I'd spoken to a lot of other people with the same issue, but no word on whether Rockstar was even aware of it.

About a week into the 1 month ban, I heard people were getting unbanned. Started up the game, and I was unbanned too. I have screenshots in my library that show the initial ban, the 1 month ban, and then the unban message. Stating my RP had been returned to a previous state for whatever reason.

So I played normally, everything seemed fine.

That is, until about a week ago. There was another ban-wave. Wouldn't you know it, I was banned again. 1 month again. There is a screenshot of that too, which proves my other ban was overturned (Rockstar NEVER overturn bans, unless they ban you by mistake). I received my second 1 month ban before the first one was even scheduled to end.

I am still banned now, and have been banned for almost 1 month all up, completely illegitimately. ♥♥♥♥'s ♥♥♥♥ed, Rockstar doesn't care and I get a bunch of nerds telling me I deserved it.

It's interesting to note that Rockstar have not contacted me at all through-out this entire mess. Not even when I was unbanned, to let me know they'd fixed their ♥♥♥♥ up. Much less to apologies.

Also interesting to note that a lot of people blamed VoIP programs and a bunch of those nerd gamer overlay programs for getting them banned. I don't use any of that ♥♥♥♥, and it still happened to me. All just speculation.

10/10 game.

♥♥♥♥♥♥ old review bellow.
__________________________________________________________

EDIT #2: BANNED AGAIN. THANK YOU ROCKSTAR. THANK YOU.

EDIT #1: UNBANNED NOW. THEY DUN ♥♥♥♥ED UP. THEY TOOK ALL MY MONEY THO

At least 1 hacker in every single online session, and they choose to ban ME for 10 days instead. Try to contact Rockstar, and they instantly close your ticket with an automated message telling me cheats have been detected, but no proof of course. So I do some reasearch, seems like a lot of people were hit with a false-positive and Rockstar doesn't care."

												Aside from an amazing Single-Player experience and playing some of it with friends I still just cannot recommend the game because of some serious issues with Rockstar. And that is because of the many things you have been hearing from the many reviews of others...

And that would be the online part of the game which many bought into to play with others in the GTA universe, and it has Grind/Pay2Win/Microtransactions/Bannings/Hackers/Trolls/Bad Customer Service and a very toxic community that this game has created. And since the creators have had little or no change in helping the many with these issues than they get the rating they deserve. *FAIL*"

												After TakeTwo (the publisher) decided to shutdown the FiveM and Citizen:MP alternative multiplayer projects, I can no longer consider this a game worth any price, and it most definitely does not represent why the PC is supposed to be the master race.

GTA Online exists ultimately for one purpose: selling Shark Cards. Online is riddled with hackers which remotely explode players, pull their names and make it look like a different player is killing other players, set players on fire remotely, spew money and hand out RP like candy on Halloween, and even if you play in private sessions with friends and nobody else, you're still going to spend an absolutely colossal amount of time grinding for RP and GTA$... unless you buy Shark Cards!

What did FiveM do? It offered multiplayer with the freedom to do whatever anyone wanted to. Cars, jets, money, weapons... we would've had custom missions if the project hadn't been shut down. Measures were implemented to prevent pirates from getting multiplayer capability, and the option existed for server administration and custom anti-cheating systems. Most importantly, however, there wasn't an arbitrary unlock system designed around levelling up. There was no cause or need for microtransactions, no need or use for Shark Cards, and no JRPG-insult of a grind! Everything was available from the start. It is also worth mentioning that these projects didn't interfere at all with GTA:Online's functionality, neither were able to be carried into the other, and to the best of my knowledge, it was never planned on.

GTA5's singleplayer leaves little to be desired aside from a still-existing problem we've had since its first release on the previous generation of consoles; cars, planes, boats, and what have you will ALL disappear forever if they get destroyed, you start a mission, you leave the general area they're in, or the game just feels like being hateful for no particular reason. The only cars which see an exemption from this are the ones the main characters start with, which while of respectable performance after upgrades, aren't enough for some of us.

I really, really don't like it when I've dropped a few million $ on a supercar and its upgrades, only for that car to despawn and never be seen again because I drove it to a mission.  It has been a little over 2 years now that GTA 5 has existed. Singleplayer mode has, to the best of my knowledge, suffered this disappearing car problem since day 1. However...

GTA: Online lets you mark a car with a tracker, lets you insure it so you don't blow $3+million for nothing, and you can switch to a different, faster car if you just unlock it and perform the requisite grinding... which is faster if you buy Shark Cards!

This tracker option doesn't really exist in Singleplayer, but it could! In fact, it seems to exist partially, in that character-specific vehicles are 'almost' always marked on your minimap. They can still despawn, but they'll usually respawn (at a safehouse, usually far away from your current location) and you'll be able to find them without paying anything... which is still a broken system, because they're still disappearing and you can't replace them with a different car.

If I have 300 million in SP mode but I still can't upgrade a player character's personal vehicle to a Zentorno, Osiris, Adder, or ANYTHING AT ALL (not even an Emperor), then there is clear favoritism for GTA: Online where we, without doubt, CAN upgrade... but it'll cost us, and we WILL pay, whether it be in time or money for $HARK CARD$!!!

These may seem like small complaints, but they really aren't. A bug which existed since Day 1 still isn't fixed, a Quality-of-Life update which Singleplayer would benefit from only exists in Online mode, and TakeTwo stamped out both of the alternatives to their poorly secured, microtransaction-riddled, hacker-filled grindfest.

Let me state clearly that Rockstar is not at fault here; it's just TakeTwo, pulling a page from EA and Activision on how to be a publisher with all the qualities so many gamers have grown to hate. GTA 5's Singleplayer is good, but it isn't perfect. GTA:Online is ultimately a system to facilitate microtransactions, and isn't worth much more than that.

I payed $75 to play GTA5; $30 for my PS3 copy and $45 through a Steam sale. Thanks to TakeTwo's actions, I realize now that I've payed far too much, and that I can't rely on the PC community to make the game any better unless they take a humongous legal risk. Furthermore, seeing as Singleplayer is missing some of the Online-improvement functions for no good reason but the promotion of Online mode (which as previously mentioned is not at all 'hacksafe' to play without people you trust), I am led to draw the conclusion that roughly 5% of Online Mode is in an acceptable state, and roughly 95% of Singleplayer is in an acceptable state.

I'd call GTAV 50% acceptable, 40% scam, and 10% bad decisions. We can't mod or take any control over the one part of it that needs it most because TakeTwo Interactive said so. The only part of this game I'd consider acceptable for the Master Race is the only part I'd consider acceptable for the console peasantry, and that's SinglePlayer. In the defense of every race, I suggest nobody pay full price. Get it in a Steam Sale, or better yet, buy used on a console, if you absolutely must have it. Everyone suffers, your gaming racial and social statuses means nothing to TakeTwo.

Update Singleplayer and do something about the current Online model. Dedicated Servers with custom Anti-Cheat scripts and an Administrator would do a better job, and modding support would make it an example of real PC Racial Mastery.

Keep GTA:Online functioning for all I care and make Dedicated Servers entirely serperate from it. I just want real multiplayer modding support and not need to grind like I'm playing a JRPG. There are people who have good ideas to make GTA5 better than what it is, and some of these ideas are the addition of what so many PC games already have.

There has not been, and never will be, an excuse of great enough magnitude for these problems still existing.

5/10, Online is HORRENDOUS and being used as an excuse to keep Singleplayer out of date, because microtransactions."

												Grand Theft Auto VNote: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.
   Field  Rating  Review    Graphics  9  A huge graphical jump from GTA IV, GTA V brings us the city of Los Santos, in grand detail, from the towering Skyscrapers, to the beautiful mountains. You'll find yourself constantly surprised by the level of detail that Rockstar put into this massive world. Gorgeous lighting effects, incredible weather effects, fantastic audio, and smooth animations come together to immerse you in Los Santos on a whole new level, especially when you check out First Person mode. As with most games though, faces leave something to be desired, though they are a huge leap from GTA IV.     Gameplay  10  From raging shootouts, to daring getaways, GTA V is a game that's hard to step away from once you start playing. Fantastic levels of customization for your clothing, cars and hair. The well-written dialogue and voice acting help to bring Los Santos to life as you ride through a bustling downtown, or take a relaxing drive through the mountains. Time and time again you'll turn a corner and find yourself complete surprised at what you find there. You could easily waste hours just poking around the environment. There is something here for everyone.     Story  7  A decent length story to go through, which spans across multiple intertwining characters. GTA V delivers another decent story by Rockstar. Though not particularly enthralling for the first bit, it certainly picks up the pace as it gets further along. You'll meet some fantastically outlandish characters in typical Rockstar fanshion, and get caught up in some ridiculous events. GTA V accomplishes what it sets out to be, a blast from start to finish.    Multiplayer  9.5  This is frankly where GTA V shines the most. A massive improvement upon GTA IV's multiplayer. With the inclusion of Heists, GTA V added a grand amount of depth to the multiplayer, allowing you to set out on multi-step missions with your friends. Or, you can simply cruise around Los Santos and murder as you please. Take selfies together in hilarious places, get in fistfights on top of skyscrapers. Skydive, swim, play darts, tennis, or golf. Watch a movie, go to strip club! Get completely smashed!  Survive an onslaught of Meth dealers, or cops, together! Play it however you want, create the character you prefer with a great level of customization being offered. The only place that GTA V loses points is in its absolutely awful menu system. Creating a private session, much less staying in it, with your friends is a convoluted process that Rockstar hopefully sorts out. Loading times are also horrendous, even with the game installed on an SSD. But don't let that stop you from playing multiplayer in GTA V. It is not an experience you want to miss out on.    Replayability  10  There are plenty of ways to die in Los Santos, and you'll spend a long time enjoying each and every one of them. Especially with your friends. The huge array of missions and activities in the world offer you plenty of incentive to come back and play again and again.    Overall  9.6/10  Though it took Rockstar an absurd amount of time to prepare the PC version of GTA V, it's a slam dunk by all accounts. Easily the best GTA yet, especially when multiplayer is taken into consideration. With massive replay value, great graphics, enjoyable gameplay, and lots more going for it, GTA V is a game that any player would be hard pressed not to enjoy. 



Also of worthy note is the video editor: Here's a clip I put together of my friends and I having some fun: The Chase

												So at first R* fails to protect the game from hacking, then they fail to ban cheaters, then they ban innocent players, then they fail to resolve any false bans while not giving any meaningful explanation.

At first I was sceptic about false ban issue but then I got banned too and I have no idea why (supposedly for using Discord?!). Rockstar support refused to remove a ban or to give a reason for a ban. Just a bot reply ""All GTA Online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed"". This is the worst support I've ever encountered."

												Great for single player, great story and can fuel hours of fun with the standard game alone. Mods make this game great though.

Online is near enough an utter grindfest for newer players and the commuinity is utter cancer, full of cheaters, children and angry pre teens that have invested more time and cash into shark cards than they have into their education as it comes to when a salty russian corrects a british child on his/her's spelling.

The anti cheat is utter garbage, false positives everywhere banning innocent players and letting cheaters roam free. You'd think with all that money they could have hired a better online security team.

If Rockstar listened to their commuinity (which they never have done really as they're still rolling in last year's sales report) perhaps this game can have another chance with me.


TL:DR
Single player: Fantastic alone, even better with mods.
Online: Avoid like the plauge, unless you have some sort of sexual fettish for getting shouted at and wasting your money.

Edit: I am aware of the fanboys mass disliking this review as well as the same people in question commenting on my profile because apparantly I'm not allowed an opinion online because I dislike a segment of a popular video game. Grow up children."

												This game costs $59.99. The servers are always fluctuating in up/down status. This game costs $59.99. Programs like Discord or any other voice chat will get you banned. This game costs $59.99. Even on a solid state drive it takes over three minutes to load into the online functions. This game costs $59.99. Rockstar Support is almost completely automated, and the only time you get a human representative they read off of a script. This game costs $59.99. The game has been out for three years and still has a massive memory leak. This game costs $59.99. Everything is locked behind a paywall in the same fashion as mobile games. This game costs $59.99. This game has extreme netcode issues and rubberbanding, leaving players online to have experiences only comparable to high latency DAYZ servers. This game costs $59.99.

But wait, this game doesn't cost $59.99. This year alone Rockstar made over $700,000,000.00 from microtransactions via Shark Cards, meaning that ALL in-game multiplayer items are purchasable through real money. If you go broke in GTA V Online you will NEVER recover unless you spend real money. At that point you will legitimately never be able to buy in-game items again with the pathetic missions and heists that were No Man's Sky'd at release. 

To be able to have every item in GTA V Online you have to spend over $500.00. 

This game costs $500.00.

The only ""Theft"" here is on Rockstar's end."

												While single player mode is enjoyable, Multiplayer is plagued by Rockstar's attempts to empty your wallet. The methods to make money in multiplayer are tedious and not very rewarding for the work you do. The worst thing about multiplayer is that they've recently adopted some new terms for playing which basically say that they'll delete your multiplayer accounts without need for explanation, which is basically what happened to me. A few years worth of progress completely deleted with no explanation. So yeah, if you really want to play it, then do so, but don't buy any Shark cards, it isn't worth it and you can't get refunds for them either."

												The single player game is rather good, but the online game is just unplayable.

1. Countless bugs. When you do a heist there is about a 50% chance that you cannot finish it because of a bug. I am not even kidding. That means if you spend 2 hours on a heist, you are only actually playing the real game for 1 hour, as most of these bugs require a restart of the game.

2. Crashes. Random crashes occur all the time. Not only that, but some crashes are so terrible that it requires you to reinstall the game. One friend of mine has reinstalled the game more than 10 times now, I am yet again not kidding. More than 10 times he needed to download the entire game again, which is about 60gb each time.

3. Glitches. The only thing in the online game that is important is money. You can buy money from the store of the game, but that is never needed. There are multiple glitches and hacks which can make you a millionaire from doing nothing. That is destroying the gameplay a lot, and the programming level of this game to make these hacks possible is just terribly low (I am a programmer myself, and I am shocked that Rockstar Games managed to do this).

4. Online in a random game is just terrible gameplay. If you are in a car (which you most likely are), people will just one hit you with an RPG or a Homing Launcher. These players then have to pay a fine for your car if it was insured, which it most likely is. That means that they have to pay for the missile shot ($1500) and then the car (~$6000), but they do not care and think that they have ""won"" the battle, even if they payed for it.
This either means that people are just not smart enough in this game to understand that what they do actually makes them lose a lot of money, or that those players are using the glitches to have unlimited money, and can therefore just waste money to win in PvP. That means that money is much greater than skill in this game.

5. Heists. Apart from all the bugs, finding people to go to a heist with is just horrible. Most people can't even speak or type in english. This makes it impossible to finish a heist with random people. You have to use external websites to find a heist team, and even then its hard to find people that can actually finish a heist (about 5% chance to win a heist each try, hours and hours doing the same thing over and over).
Even if you finish all heists in a row, or without dying at all, there are bugs that removes the additional money given for achievements. This means that you can spend around 10 hours doing an achievement, and then when you should get $10 000 000 for it, you just get nothing.

I always wanted to work at Rockstar Games, but now I feel that I have nothing to learn from them. How can they fail so miserably making a game that works with that much money?"

												Writing a new review now:

Online is garbage as stated, no need to beat a dead horse

But the story, the story was abnosultely terrible. Let me just start off with saying, I don't care, didn't care, and couldn't care about the main characters. We start off with a Bank Heist and the main characters are immediately given out as heartless bad guys. I know GTA is about being bad, but hear me out. In 4 I cared about Niko, he was an immigrant coming to America, trying to start fresh, start new, get his life going, live the dream. He has a cousin already established, and that cousin helps him grow. We feel attached to Niko, we care about Roman, the story has it's ups and downs, it's a classic story of trying to do the right thing. Now GTA V, a bunch of heartless thieves with shallow back stories and no depth to them. Why should I care about some random hood gangster, why would I care about a guy who's more than well off and has a comfy home life, why would I care about a batshit insane trailer trash guy? I can't feel for these characters, everything bad that happens to them is because they deserved it. Niko and Roman were trying to make it good, were trying to start new, but these guys, they're just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. And who cares about a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s."

												Long story short. For people who love GTA and want to play singleplayer only, this is for you. 
If you want to play online, you will probably get killed by hackers. And guess what? Rockstar does nothing about it. There is no simple way to report players, so your only options are to hope to find a good session without any hackers. Game itself 10/10, GTA Online 3/10 hackers everywhere...

--EDIT--
This is it...Decided to improve my flying skills, all of the sudden my character jumps off the plane (I didn't press anything), freezes and that's it. Can't move at all (Some sort of hack). Joined another session. After few minutes I noticed two people with godmode on, so I went passive mode. But guess what? They started shooting cars at me and I died about 10 times. I advice you not to buy this game at all."

												So. GTAV. I cant say Ive ever had a game I both loved and hated at the same time.
I'll start off by saying that this game IS good. My negative review is simply because it doesnt deserve such high praise.

Everything in this game thats good is offset by something bad, almost always tied directly to Rockstar being greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The world is incredible. Beautiful map, the amount of detail is astonishing. The vehicles are fantastic. Theres plenty to do and see. Its also a NIGHTMARE to play.

You'd think some of that over $500,000,000 they made JUST IN MICROTRANSACTION SALES would go into moderating the online play, but that would cut into their profits.

It is next to impossible to join a single server that isnt plagued with MULTIPLE modders. Almost all of which do nothing but blow you up, teleport and godmode their way to win events, strip your weapons, and crash your client. Considering the price of EVERYTHING in this game is set by Rockstar to try to make you buy their horrendously overpriced shark cards, Having modders ruin damn near everything in the game that you can use to make money makes it next to impossible to buy anything if you werent lucky enough to have had cash dumped on you ages ago that didnt get you banned. The only modders Rockstar ever seems to even try to deal with are the ones that spawn money, because Rockstar doesnt care about players who are ruining the game, only ones that might make them lose money from microtransactions.

Once Rockstar has your money for the game, they dont give a ♥♥♥♥ how your gameplay is.

They even removed the ability to email information about modders in, which could include video footage. Now its just the report button. Which the latest mod menus seem to be able to block from sending anyways, from what everyone says now.

I dont regret having bought the game, but its saddening to see Rockstar going the way of EA and so many AAA game devs these days. I'll honestly have to think hard about it on whether I'd be willing to buy a new GTA after this one.

I miss the developer that ruined my childhood innocence with San Andreas back in the day. Come back Rockstar."

												Don't get the game on PC unless you are going to play the story mode. Sadly, this game is flooded with modders online. They do anything they can to ruin the experience of GTA: Online by trying to crash your game, aimbotting, god mode, spawning objects like ferris wheels on you or around the map, giving fake money or even taking away money, removing levels, and just overall destroying the game. DON'T PLAY ONLINE UNTIL ROCKSTAR FIXES THEIR ♥♥♥♥."

Im sorry to tell you, but you will get banned for no reason in this game. My 2 friends go banned in GTA online for reasons that R* did not tell us. After this christmas, more than 84.000 players got banned and yes some of them were cheaters/modders, but if you are unfortunate enough to connect to a session with these kind of players, than GG, you will be banned in the next week/month. This is because R* are too lazy to employ people to look after the game, instead they have this broken, stupid system that bans everyone left and right. IM NOT GOING TO SUPPORT R* in the future unless they change this system and neither should you..."

												After TakeTwo (the publisher) decided to shutdown the FiveM and Citizen:MP alternative multiplayer projects, I can no longer consider this a game worth any price, and it most definitely does not represent why the PC is supposed to be the master race.

GTA Online exists ultimately for one purpose: selling Shark Cards. Online is riddled with hackers which remotely explode players, pull their names and make it look like a different player is killing other players, set players on fire remotely, spew money and hand out RP like candy on Halloween, and even if you play in private sessions with friends and nobody else, you're still going to spend an absolutely colossal amount of time grinding for RP and GTA$... unless you buy Shark Cards!

What did FiveM do? It offered multiplayer with the freedom to do whatever anyone wanted to. Cars, jets, money, weapons... we would've had custom missions if the project hadn't been shut down. Measures were implemented to prevent pirates from getting multiplayer capability, and the option existed for server administration and custom anti-cheating systems. Most importantly, however, there wasn't an arbitrary unlock system designed around levelling up. There was no cause or need for microtransactions, no need or use for Shark Cards, and no JRPG-insult of a grind! Everything was available from the start. It is also worth mentioning that these projects didn't interfere at all with GTA:Online's functionality, neither were able to be carried into the other, and to the best of my knowledge, it was never planned on.

GTA5's singleplayer leaves little to be desired aside from a still-existing problem we've had since its first release on the previous generation of consoles; cars, planes, boats, and what have you will ALL disappear forever if they get destroyed, you start a mission, you leave the general area they're in, or the game just feels like being hateful for no particular reason. The only cars which see an exemption from this are the ones the main characters start with, which while of respectable performance after upgrades, aren't enough for some of us.

I really, really don't like it when I've dropped a few million $ on a supercar and its upgrades, only for that car to despawn and never be seen again because I drove it to a mission.  It has been a little over 2 years now that GTA 5 has existed. Singleplayer mode has, to the best of my knowledge, suffered this disappearing car problem since day 1. However...

GTA: Online lets you mark a car with a tracker, lets you insure it so you don't blow $3+million for nothing, and you can switch to a different, faster car if you just unlock it and perform the requisite grinding... which is faster if you buy Shark Cards!

This tracker option doesn't really exist in Singleplayer, but it could! In fact, it seems to exist partially, in that character-specific vehicles are 'almost' always marked on your minimap. They can still despawn, but they'll usually respawn (at a safehouse, usually far away from your current location) and you'll be able to find them without paying anything... which is still a broken system, because they're still disappearing and you can't replace them with a different car.

If I have 300 million in SP mode but I still can't upgrade a player character's personal vehicle to a Zentorno, Osiris, Adder, or ANYTHING AT ALL (not even an Emperor), then there is clear favoritism for GTA: Online where we, without doubt, CAN upgrade... but it'll cost us, and we WILL pay, whether it be in time or money for $HARK CARD$!!!

These may seem like small complaints, but they really aren't. A bug which existed since Day 1 still isn't fixed, a Quality-of-Life update which Singleplayer would benefit from only exists in Online mode, and TakeTwo stamped out both of the alternatives to their poorly secured, microtransaction-riddled, hacker-filled grindfest.

Let me state clearly that Rockstar is not at fault here; it's just TakeTwo, pulling a page from EA and Activision on how to be a publisher with all the qualities so many gamers have grown to hate. GTA 5's Singleplayer is good, but it isn't perfect. GTA:Online is ultimately a system to facilitate microtransactions, and isn't worth much more than that.

I payed $75 to play GTA5; $30 for my PS3 copy and $45 through a Steam sale. Thanks to TakeTwo's actions, I realize now that I've payed far too much, and that I can't rely on the PC community to make the game any better unless they take a humongous legal risk. Furthermore, seeing as Singleplayer is missing some of the Online-improvement functions for no good reason but the promotion of Online mode (which as previously mentioned is not at all 'hacksafe' to play without people you trust), I am led to draw the conclusion that roughly 5% of Online Mode is in an acceptable state, and roughly 95% of Singleplayer is in an acceptable state.

I'd call GTAV 50% acceptable, 40% scam, and 10% bad decisions. We can't mod or take any control over the one part of it that needs it most because TakeTwo Interactive said so. The only part of this game I'd consider acceptable for the Master Race is the only part I'd consider acceptable for the console peasantry, and that's SinglePlayer. In the defense of every race, I suggest nobody pay full price. Get it in a Steam Sale, or better yet, buy used on a console, if you absolutely must have it. Everyone suffers, your gaming racial and social statuses means nothing to TakeTwo.

Update Singleplayer and do something about the current Online model. Dedicated Servers with custom Anti-Cheat scripts and an Administrator would do a better job, and modding support would make it an example of real PC Racial Mastery.

Keep GTA:Online functioning for all I care and make Dedicated Servers entirely serperate from it. I just want real multiplayer modding support and not need to grind like I'm playing a JRPG. There are people who have good ideas to make GTA5 better than what it is, and some of these ideas are the addition of what so many PC games already have.

There has not been, and never will be, an excuse of great enough magnitude for these problems still existing.

5/10, Online is HORRENDOUS and being used as an excuse to keep Singleplayer out of date, because microtransactions."

												Was permanently banned for no reason from their GTA Online servers. Contacted their support via ticket, and was told 'the ban was permanent', and they closed the ticket. Called their support, even told them I had video proof of not cheating, and they said 'the ban is permanent', and hung up on me.

EDIT: Because people were complaining about a 7 1/2 hour video (something I did to show my transition from working to playing GTA) I've uploaded the video to YouTube. The video has cut out me working, and goes straight to moments before I open Steam, and run GTA, to the moment I get banned:


	
	
		YouTube™ Video: Thanks, Rockstar! False-Positive Ban. 
		
			Views: 2,123		
		
			Not sure if audio is synced properly, but I don't care enough to re-render the 15GB video file. TL;DR: Opened the game on Steam, made a new character, played for 3 and a half hours.		
	



Despite being permanently banned for absolutely no reason, the game's online experience is horrible, littered with cheaters and frequent disconnects and bugs. Loading screen takes about four minutes, even on an SSD. Missions get canceled as players get booted from the online service due to Rockstar's terrible online servers. Joining sessions with your friends are hit-and-miss, and you'll likely get kicked offline to single-player many times while joining any online session, only to be greeted by the four-minute loading screen again. You can actually see this problem occur in my video. The game never logs in the first time I create my character, and I have to do it again. It's about ten minutes before I even get to play.

If you choose to buy the game, do it for the single-player campaign. The characters in the game are likeable and well-designed, and the missions are pretty fun to do. If you're buying the game for the online experience, don't expect anything at all besides a horrible time. Thankfully for me, I don't really care about being banned from GTA, as I only bought it for single-player in the first place and have beaten the campaign and gotten most of the achievements. I typically don't review products, but I thought it was important for others to know there's a possibility of being banned without warning and without reason."

												Would have easily recommended this game before Steam's 2015 Summer sale--fantastic game, incredibly immersive, tons of fun--but sadly I won't be recommending any Rockstar games anymore.

The company essentially bundled in-game cash DLC with the base game, raised the price of the bundle to $80, and marked the bundle 25% off so that it sold ""on sale"" for the regular base price of $60. On top of this, Rockstar (initially) pulled the base game from their store page, which made it seem like the cash card bundle was the only version of the game you could purchase (effectively hiding the fact that the base game is not actually on sale).

To top everything off though, purchasing the cash card bundle is basically Rockstar's way of skirting around Steam's new refund policy. Buying the bundle and starting up the game immediately ties the cash card to your account, which disqualifies you from requesting a refund even if you play the game for less than two hours. It's a ♥♥♥♥ move. I'm just disappointed I've already given Rockstar my money. Wish I could get it back.

Won't be buying another Rockstar game anytime soon."

												I am disappointed on where this game has gone, despite how long I've used to play this game nearly everyday.

Hackers are in just about every lobby and Rockstar does the worst job to take care of this issue. Often, innocent players are being banned, blown up, teleported, or trapped (to name a few things) for absolutely no other reason besides being in the lobby, knowingly or unknowingly, with a hacker. I've waited a couple months now to wait for Rockstar to improve their system or completely resolve this, but everytime I try to log onto GTA V to check, I'm told that I can't connect to the servers (Or something similar), even after I've confirmed on Rockstar's site that their servers were infact running.

Rockstar's support system will not help you either, they simply just want you to buy their game and then ignore the fact that you were falsely banned or can't even play.. None of my support tickets have been responded to, ever, and I'm obviously not the only one either as seen all over the support section of their site. I strongly suggest that you do not support their game, it seems as if they just want your money."

Multiplayer is cancer. A hacker can spawn 500 moneybags on your head and he'll never get detected. There is no way for you NOT to pick up the money as its picked up automatically. The moment you involuntary pick up the money - you're ♥♥♥♥ed.

Nowhere on the game or its description or manual does it say that you're required to report the money to be removed by Rockstar. Even if you do go and try to report it on Rockstar's support site - it doesn't work. The submit button hasn't been working in months. You're basically ♥♥♥♥ed.

Rockstar uses 3 strikes system which would be okay if they wouldn't ban you 3 times for the exactly the same ♥♥♥♥ because they're too mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to revoke the cash you recieved from your first strike

												Great Game, horrible company. I've been banned twice now, the first time for TV remotes in my apartment that were duplicating themselves, and the second time for apparently jumping out of an airplane (This is all me guessing the most plausible cause, since you are given no reason).

And as per usual, Rockstar Support refuses to be cooperative, even to the point of completely closing down their phone line to avoid having to speak to any frustrated player. Submitting a support ticket, even with evidence of your innocence, results in the same bot response and an immediate closing of the ticket. You should essentially expect to be banned at some point if you buy this game.

UPDATE: After my 30 day ban ended, I decided I would play the game once more just to enjoy it before my inevitable permanent ban. And I was entirely correct, because after the entirety of one evening, I wake up to be perma-banned.

Based on when I got the violation notice e-mail, It banned me when I was logging off - when I still had a three star wanted level. Oddly enough, my friend who did the exact same thing (but has no bans on his record) can still play the game. Amusing to say the least."

												I would have recommended this game, until rockstar pulled their latest stunt as part of the summer sale. 'Bundling' the game with a card for in-game currency, then marking it up, just so the sale price is the same as the regular game. 'Technically' not illegal. They've officially proven that they care more about raking in money and screwing over their fanbase than drawing in new fans. Deceptive, sleasy marketing at it's scummiest."

												 YOU WILL NOT GET BANNED FOR USING MODS IN SP, ONLY MP. THEY DO NOT HAVE A MAGIC TURN OFF BUTTON WHEN YOU GO ONLINE 
Do not listen to the popular review circlejerk, they are arrogant idiots who did not realize that  all  mods were not permitted online, yes, even FoV ones as silly as it sounds. It is justified as it's a unauthorized modification to the game's code which is a breach of GTA online's use.

												I never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big. Rockstar has priced GTA V to $80 and reduced it to $60, then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra ♥♥♥♥ no one wants. By bundling the game with the micro transaction money, anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund. Not only is this a violation of FTC regulation and EU law, it is the biggest ♥♥♥♥ move I have seen on steam yet. I would have rather had my $60 go to the WarZ devs than this ♥♥♥♥. Since then, rockstar has added the ability to buy GTA V alone for $60. Truly a noble move. They don't even have this level of garbage business on consoles."

												Only time I've reviewed a game and it's more of a warning.

Bought the game, downloaded, played for a couple hours with an IRL friend, came home from work the next day and was banned. I was given no reason why, just an email linking to the EULA & ToS. Immediately tried contacting Rockstar Support and received a generic computer generated message, once again, linking me to the EULA & ToS and now saying they don't overturn bans. 

I'll rate the game 7/10 from the short time I played, the customer support a 0/10.


[EDIT] Turns out Rockstar's hack prevention program considers recording software to be malicious. Rockstar bans follow a three strike program (10 days, 30 days, permanent). 
I'll change my review once Rockstar support becomes competent."

												Price gouging/hiking/inflation as well as Product-Tying is a crime in several jurisdictions, and entitles the consumer to a refund for a very blatant, anti-consumer practice. 

If you live in;
Australia (via ACCC)
Canada
Germany
Ireland
United Kingdom (via ASA)
United States (via FTC and Former Price Comparison)
New Zealand (via Fair Trading Act)

If you live in the above countries, you are entitled to a refund if you bought the game during the price-hike/product-tying. If you don't, I recommend you ask a lawyer or equivalent. Although rectified, the act still occured. Because a thief returns a man's property, doesn't mean the crime didn't occur."

												My first day in Grand Theft Auto V:

● I accidently blew up a truck - > Mission failed
● I tried to kill and run towards the enemies - > Instantly died
● I drove a car - > Got stuck or destroyed the car
● I raced with the car - > Did not even finish the first lap while the others finished all of them
● I ran after the civilians - > I did not keep up
● I went swimming - > I drowned within 30 seconds
● I flew a plane - > Crashed it within 30 seconds
● I flew a helicopter - > It started to smoke within 1 minute

And I still loved the game

Now I got the hang of it and today's experience is:

● Awesome radio stations
● Awesome strip club and strippers
● Awesome tv channels (aliens, furries and all that weirdgood stuff)
● Awesome movies at the cinema
● Awesome graphics, lightning and city
● Awesome gameplay (heists, missions, races etc)
● Awesome hours of laughing and tears
● Awesome game, I am still amazed by how the game looks like
● Awesome to play with and without friends
● Awesome ♥♥♥♥ing story! I have finished the story, it was great! (Way better missions and heists)

Also note that:

● You can point your middle finger to anyone. If you are on a bike, car, boat, anything!
● You can pick up hockers during the night. (Note that they often wear red clothes).
● You can easily lose the cops by driving off-road. If that does not work just call creepy uncle Lester♥, he will help you out!

Remember, we are all noobs at first.
GTA V is definetly worth the money

												WARNING, DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ONLINE.

The game itself is well made. The support, well....there is no support. Unless you have a question where the answer can also be found on Google (they are happy to explain you things that you can find yourself as well), you will get an automated reply. For what I've seen, a lot of new people (including my friend) are getting banned without a reason from GTA 5 online. The ban period is for one month. Since there was nothing he did wrong, there is a big chance that when he logs in after that month, he will be perma banned.  When you address this issue to R*, all they do is give you the same reply over and over again and redirect you to their license and agreement. I would NOT recommend to buy this game, since you can get banned without a reason. R*'s ego about their automated ban system is so huge, starting a discussion with them about it is just a waste of your own time.

For all the people that are sitting, ready to reply: ""your friend is a cheater, he got what was coming to him"", just forget it.
I would not waste my time writing this review if I knew he hacked/cheated or whatever.

Please note that this review is regarding the support R* doensn't offer and GTA 5 online. Once you've sent them your money, don't count on any help. Bans can't be appealed, even though you are innocent.

For the people who do risk their money, I hope this won't happen to you.

Update 2-12-16: one month later, just as predicted my friend was banned again (permaban). He even asked R* to check his files before he logged in with a clean install. They refused and said to contact them again when he would be banned. We all know where this is going. Will update when something comes out of it, if not...we gave up on this game."

												We had fun in GTA Online before my friend got banned out of nowhere.

Yeah, the public playerbase was pretty bad, and the business model was scummy, but truth be told, my overall experience was great.

Playing mostly on private servers, my group of friends and I built characters from nothing together. As we made money, playing stupidly-fun minigames and going on deathmatch rampages, we created our characters’ lore. Buying new outfits, houses, and cars, we created the personalities and relationships between our characters. From the first convenience store robberies we committed to the “hard mode” heists we tried over and over to beat, everything we did spawned stories of our virtual lives.

After 140+ hours of glorious, stupid fun, we took about a month’s hiatus. We played a few other group-based games, such as ESO and Don’t Starve Together, but we ended up feeling inclined to reunite our virtual characters in GTA Online. After this time away, we were ready to have some more fun, reuniting in a game that brought us all closer together as a group.

That was until one of us logged on, saw that they had been suspended for 30 days, and read that their character had been completely reset.

Why was our friend banned? Who knows. Based on what I’ve read (and we’ve been studying into it for hours in hopes of getting our friend's character back), there’s no hope. Rockstar’s employed some sort of algorithm that ends up banning both guilty hackers and innocent players alike out of nowhere, with no distinction. I’m not going to lie, when we went onto public servers we frequently met hackers. The issue is that my friend wasn’t one of them.

“You have violated the EULA,” the suspension email states, “this decision is final.”

Rockstar, you know how to make a really good game - Red Dead Redemption and both Grand Theft Auto 4 & 5 were excellent in single-player - but I can’t support this blatant lack of care for supporting your online players. 60 dollars and 140+ hours just went down the drain, because your robot randomly banned our friend, you won’t say why, and none of your “support” staff (if they even exist) care to respond to any players in the same situation.

I won’t support this bafflingly unprofessional treatment of GTA Online’s playerbase.

=====

Basically, single player is great. Online can be as well, but good luck not getting suspended or banned out of nowhere, for no reason. You won’t know why you were banned. You won’t get support. You’ll lose time and money. And Rockstar won’t even care."

TL:DR at bottom

ONLY PURCHASE THIS GAME IF YOU INTEND TO PLAY SINGLEPLAYER

Single player lasts about 30 hours and ""GTA: Online"" is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.


INTRODUCTION

The single player story is great and all, but that's not why most people buy this game, they buy it for ""GTA: Online"".



EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE


GTA: Online wasn't always horrible, I'd say there was a time when it was actually fun. In it's current state, mostly everything in Online revolves around the ""Sharkcard"" the micro-transaction item that gives you in game money. All of the cool vehicles and houses/offices/gang buildings, are excessively expensive. In order to get the money required to purchase these items, you need to grind missions for hours on end. 

""Couldn't you just play Heists?""
Heists are great and all, but it's going to take a little more than 2 or 3 runs through the Pacific standard job to save up the ~6,000,000 dollars you need to purchase some of the newest vehicles.

""Why not just cheat the money in?""
A great way to move into the next point

BANNING

If you get banned, rockstar will never tell you why. Sure, maybe you know damn well why you were banned, but some people don't. Some people log into their game and have a permanent (or 20 year) ban on their account. And if these people who got randomly banned call rockstar support and ask why they got banned, and if they can get unbanned, they get the big middle finger.

STORY TIME

If you don't give a ♥♥♥♥, skip to the next asterisk border.
***************************************************
Playing dota 2 with a friend, friend's phone lights up. It's an email from rockstar support saying he violated the terms of service. 

Friend:""What?""

He launches GTA V and finds out that he's been banned for a month. With about 800 hours sank into the game, you could probably say he enjoys playing it. So he files a ticket on the rockstar support website and gets a cookie-cutter email 2 seconds later. Now upset, he contacts rockstar support via telephone.

Support: (Introduction: Hello, this is bill with rockstar support.... etc.)

Friend gives them all the information they want(Name, email, etc.)

Support: ""Alright, what do you need help with today""

Friend: ""I got randomly banned""

Support:(This is the email response, but most of the employees who work Customer support have a phrase similar to this memorised. My friend called several times and during the call asked if they had the phrase memorised, to which they replied either ""Yes"" or ""Mostly"".)

Thank you for contacting Rockstar Support. GTA Online bans are the result of automated analysis related to modding in GTA Online, exploiting or abusing game mechanics, or otherwise interfering with other players' gameplay experience. If you are banned from GTA Online, your ban expiration date is shown in the lowerleft corner after being returned to Story Mode following an attempt to play online. We generally do not overturn temporary bans nor can we guarantee individual responses to any temporary or permanent ban appeals however, we will review the evidence you submitted and take it into consideration. No further information is required from you at this time, and this ticket will close on its own.

(I'll refer to this as ""//Cookie-Cutter Response//"" from now on in order to save space.)

Friend:""Can I atleast know, why I'm banned?""

Suppport: Something along the lines of ""Our banning procedure is automatic and we cannot access why you were banned.""

Friend: ""Don't you think your automated process might mess up sometimes?""

Support: //Cookie-Cutter Response// (Except friend Interrupts support about halfway through)

Friend: ""So what you're saying is that your automated system is perfect and has no flaws whatsoever? And that I can just get banned when I'm not even playing the game?""

Support: Generic Apology that makes you feel like a toddler (You know the ones, the ""Sorry, not sorry."" apologies) 
 
Support: Addresses that bans can be a result of reports, and thus can happen when not playing the game.

Friend: Asks a few other things with no help and then gets transfered to someone else, He asked for a higher up, but I doubt he was actually given to someone ""higher up""
 
Support: Goes through generic intro and gets information from other customer support employee.

Support: ""Okay, and what was it you needed help with?""

Friend: ""I wanted to know if you could confirm that I'm actually banned for me and if you can figure out why.""

Support: Asks for social club ID, mishears the letter ""G"" as ""J"" and can't access the account.

Support: Asks for CD Key of game (This is tied to your steam account, and thus your social club ID)

Friend: Gives CD Key

Support: Apologizes for mishearing the letter ""G""

Support: ""Yes this social club account is banned from GTA: Online.""

Friend: ""Can you tell me why it was banned?""

Support: ""Everything here matches up.""

Friend: ""What matches up?""

Support: //Cookie-Cutter Response//

Friend(Interupting the //Cookie-Cutter Response//): Do you have that memorised?

Support: ""For the most part, you'd be suprised how many people call in with issues relating to bans.""

Friend: ""So you can't help me with my ban?""

Support: ""No, and if there's nothing else I can help you with, I'm going to have to let you go.""

Friend: ""So I'm just screwed? What if this happens again? I got the one month ban this time, What happens when I get randomly banned and it's permanent?""

Support: Something along the lines of //Coookie-Cutter Response//

Friend doesn't interupt this time

Support asks if he needs help with anything, friend says ""no"".

Support: ""Thank you for calling rockstar support, have a nice day.""

Friend: ""Thanks for nothing.""

I'll give you one guess as to what happened one or two months later to spark this review.

A good buddy of mine(Not the friend in the story) starts steam messaging me. Haven't talked to him in ~6 or 7 months. Says he's going to buy GTA V. He does it, installs it. My Good buddy, My Friend and I boot up GTA Online. 


My friend is permanently banned from GTA Online.


***************************************************************


Nobody likes cheaters, the guy who drives around and shoots everyone with his explosive pistol. Those guys need to be banned. What about the guy who spawns money on himself and others? Well, there's no doubt he's ""Impeding Shark-Card sales"", so ban him. What about the guy who got money dropped on him? Lucky you, rockstar already answered this question, they said they wouldn't.
However, it's speculated that you can get banned for selling cars that you buy with money that gets dropped on you. It's also speculated that using some of these programs will get you banned.


	
	
		[SAFE] HOW TO PREVENT FROM GETTING BAN FOR NO REASON [ONLINE IS SAFE NOW] [THREAD CLOSED] 
		A Guide for Grand Theft Auto V
		By: Original Protonium Egg
		
			for those scared to play gta online after the latest patch 7/6/16 GTA Online: Further Adventures in Finance and Felony .here is the exposed rockstar detection that i do some research...enjoy and sorry for bad english...		
	



Notice how all the ban reasons are speculated. This is because rockstar doesn't tell people why they get banned. Having 800 hours on a game and not logging in after a major update out of fear of being permanently banned is stupid. But it's what people have to do. That or get banned and have to go spend 60 dollars on another copy of gta v
______________________________________


TL:DR

To conclude, random bans happen and rockstar won't explain them. Only buy for single player. The random ban is constantly floating over your head. Rockstar support sucks.

												GTA 5 finally arrives on PC after a long delay but the big question is, was it worth the wait? 

If you haven't played GTA on previous and current gen consoles then this you will definitely want to get it. The campaign on  its own is totally worth the price and with all the Stranger missions, you will be occupied for some time. However, the multiplayer is what will keep you coming back to the game for more.  Rockstar's main focus post-release is on GTA: Online and with their regular release of free updates, there's always something new for players to try out. For any beginners to GTA: Online, here's a handy and short guide with all the need to know

Moving onto performance which is one of the reasons why GTA was delayed so much for PC. There doesn't actually seem to be any major problems with running it. Because the game was made with PS3/Xbox 360 in mind, the required specs aren't amazingly high. Obviously, if you want to be running it in all it's glory and at high resolutions then you will need better equipment."

												I used to love this game so much. I've played more than 200 hours across PC, PS4, and PS3. My review for this game used to be so positive as I loved how much there was to do. However, I now have to make my review negative for the following reasons.

I've had my current character for over two years. In those two years I reached level 100 and I have so much stuff like multiple properties, a yacht, a business, a biker gang, etc. Not once have I modded GTA Online, but that didn't stop them from banning me.

I recently logged on to find out that my account was suspended until next month, and that when my account became available again, I would have to start over. My first thought was that this is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I didn't hack, I worked my way for a long time to get my character to where it was now and I lose it all because Rockstar can't tell the difference between a modder and a regular user.

My second thought is that ""this is why people hack"". Rockstar makes everything in GTA Online super expensive. It's over $1mil for a damn tug boat, a really ugly tug boat. I can buy a nice super car for a quarter of that price, any car would be better that a slow ♥♥♥ tug boat. Everything is so expensive that you either have to grind forever (there are good methods of making money but they require you to spend a lot of money first), buy shark cards, or get a modder to give you money.

Honestly, this game has gone to absolute crap for me."

												Hey guys, I don't usually write reviews, but Grand Theft Auto V is a game that is absolutely worth it.

A game that breaked most impressive records of Guiness Book:



        Best-selling action-adventure video game in 24 hours (12 milion copies)
        Best-selling video game in 24 hours (564 milion$)

        Most viewed trailer for an action-adventure video game
        Most viewed trailer of an action-adventure video-game (800+ milion views)



Graphics

1. Graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible. The game runs smooth on any kind of GPU's and CPU's as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements. By the way, these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details.

2. Graphic details are the best I have seen, especially in an open-world game. If I was to tell you all about this topic, I would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours, because boy there are lots to talk about. I'm just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me. 

a) Day/Night cycle recreation. Sure this is not something new in its essence, it has been done before and not just in GTA, but the way we see it here it's what's amazing. The way the light shifts from one period of the day to another it's off the charts. You don't even realize when the afternoon becomes evening. The only way you can tell, it's that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you.

b) Rain. Again, not a new feature, actually is quite an old one BUT the way it's been reproduced in GTAV ... You can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact. Apart from the obvious, what makes rain so special in GTAV ? Well, THE SOUND. This is something that not many people talk about, yet is one of the breathtaking features of the game.The way Rockstar Games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain (besides everything else).

c) Night time, baby! Sure we had night in GTA IV and even before that, so why do I mention this ? Well, because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows. I am not talking just about the graphics aspect. What I'm saying is that the night in GTAV gives you the impression of actual liveliness; the whole city comes to life. It's just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever.

3. Cars are the best looking and are way ahead those we've seen in previous GTA's. I'm not talking about a direct comparison, because of the obvious reason (2015-2010) but what I'm trying to say is that I personally wasn't that impressed at the time by the cars/helis/planes in GTA4 as I am now in GTAV.

Gameplay and Features

Oh yea, the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for GTAV to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come.

1. Car Control I feel like thanking Rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter. Car control was preety much garbage in GTA IV and for this reason alone I had no big expectations for this new series. Well, I was wrong. The car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing NFS MW back in the day. Besides the control, there is the sound of the car's engine which is perfectly accurate.

2. Randomness. Now what in God's name I'm talking about?! Well, have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help ? A woman's that was about to get ♥♥♥♥♥, a kid who's bike was stolen, hitchhiker asking you to take her/him home, etc usually for a reward. If you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal, but baby, this stuff gives GTAV a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game.

3. Los Santos Customs. Again, not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special. Have you tried modifying the car's suspension? Of course you did, what am I saying! But have you actually paid attention of it's realism AFTER the change was made? Well, for those who haven't and for the one's who dont own the game yet, let me tell you that this feature is game-making. My favorite car in GTAV is the Grotti Carbonizzare also known as the Ferarri F12. Now think, how am I gonna drive that beast on the city's roads? Especially in areas like Groove, Hilwood, Rockford. These are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads, so you cant really drive a Ferarri in these parts of the town. Well, you can. Modifying the suspension to a higher state doesn't just make for visual effects, but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads, turns, hard turns. BTW, if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn, you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings. For me, this is one of the best things I've seen in this game. 

4. Activities. Driving, mission making, robberies, flying, hunting, diving, piloting aircrafts, submarines, boats, golf, tennis, cards, smoke weed, racing, playing the stock market. You will never get bored in this game, not even in Single Player mode.   

There are so many more things to talk about, but the review would be monstruosly long, so In a few words: buy the game, it will be the best investment you have done in a PC game. For those who thaught the review was too long and skipped to the bottom, I can tell you in short, that this game excels in every aspect:: Weapons look so realistic in First Person mode, cars have a mind blowing realistic control, weather has never been better reproduced, etc. GL&HF"

												Rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet, sweet steam summer sale. 0/10 would not recommend again.

****Update****

Okay, so some people don't understand why people are mad that the base game is not on sale. When Steam's Summer Sale first began, the base game of GTA V was on sale for $30, but it was only at that price for roughly 10-20 minutes. Instead of keeping it at that price, they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale, which, as countless others have stated, is shady business. I'm not mad that the base game isn't on sale; it's their right as a company to not have to put it on sale. I'm just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics."

												This game is great, until you go to play online... It takes waaay to long to load online (close to 5 minutes on a high end pc like mine) and once you get there it is miserable to play. Nearly every session i have joined the past 2 weeks has at least one hacker either giving everyone money, or just running around with invincibility killing everyone. What finally pushed me over the edge is when I was playing online with a friend doing our own thing and then all of a sudden everyone on the server dies because they are crushed by falling rocks, then there is a clone of the character stuck to my body and even after killing it and myself, it just stayed. It only gets worse, my friend and I didn't mind it to much and it was a bit comical at times, but then we are all killed again except this time blown up which destroyed my car that I had to make the claim on and drained all cash and removed all guns. About 30 seconds after that it was flooded, literally. I did what a responsible person would do and reported the hacker as i have to most of the other hackers that I pass by and what does Rockstar do? Nothing. Absolutely &%$#ing nothing to the point where I saw the same hacker a week later doing the same thing in a different server. It has gotten to the point where I don't even bother playing online anymore because you simply can't.

TL:DR Version:
Rockstar needs to get it together with banning hackers, and until then, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you plan on playing online or it will be miserable for you."

												To start this off, I honestly love this game, its probably one of my favourite games of all time, but Rockstar really doesn't seem to care about its customers. I have over 350 hours in this game and have never used cheats a single time, but I was recently in a session with a hacker in which I recieved no money or anything from the hacker that could be used to get me banned, yet I was banned for no reason. My friend was also in the session and he asked if anybody in the session had reported me, the hacker responded saying he was trying to kill me earlier but I wasn't taking any damage and accused me of using God Mode, he admitted to reporting me for hacking, and without any evidence I got a 10 day ban. By now you would think Rockstar is at least trying to prevent this from happening."

												400+ hours online. 

Reported modders/hackers and griefers.

December 19th - Reported a modder who repeatedly teleports to and kills players, or teleported people to him, dropped money on them and stuff.
December 20th - Tried to log in and noticed: ""Banned until 30/12/2015"". Reasons unspecified except for an email with a rather ""broad"" explanation, stating I ""cheated"".

By the end of January, same ♥♥♥♥. Got banned because... reasons?

And by Mid-June, got permanently banned because... reasons too? Apparently they didn't remove the hacker money I got, even though I reported it to them. So after selling a car I had bought in like December or so, they banned me on grounds of earning money ""unfairly"" - selling something I had for 6 months or more.

The amont of hackers in-game is ridiculous, and Rockstar DO NOT LIKE HELPING PEOPLE. You can get banned even when you're not online or playing the game because someone will hack in-game using your name and Rockstar will ban YOU. Oh, you'll also get banned for mods. So basically, if you're going to buy this game....

												While single player mode is enjoyable, Multiplayer is plagued by Rockstar's attempts to empty your wallet. The methods to make money in multiplayer are tedious and not very rewarding for the work you do. The worst thing about multiplayer is that they've recently adopted some new terms for playing which basically say that they'll delete your multiplayer accounts without need for explanation, which is basically what happened to me. A few years worth of progress completely deleted with no explanation. So yeah, if you really want to play it, then do so, but don't buy any Shark cards, it isn't worth it and you can't get refunds for them either."

												 My Experience With Rockstar Support 
   Well, as you may pick up from the title, anybody posting about experience with support is most likely posting something negative. This is most definitely true.

   I begin my story, 2 days ago, playing GTA 5 - Online and having some fun with friends. Since I'm slightly impatient I decided to purchase a $10 shark card to assist me in getting me started up. Purchased some weapons, vehicle, upgrades, all that jazz. The next day I start up the game only to see that I have been banned with no explanation as to why I have been banned.

   Of course, I move onto the support website. I submit a support ticket explaining my issue and get a response back within minutes of posting the ticket. I was impressed!! Such fast response times!!

   Just kidding, it was just an automated response explaining that bans are automated and they can't do anything about it. So then I decided to call. 51 calls just to get into the waiting line, 47 minute hold, brief explanation of myself, and another 7 minute hold all to be told the same ♥♥♥♥ the automated system on the website told me.

   I still have no idea as to why I was banned. Never hacked. Never modded. Never abused anybody. Thank you support for literally wasting my time.

Other than the stupid banning of innocent people, including a friend of mine who has been temp banned twice now and will be perma banned on the next one, it's fun with friends.

 Verdict 
Would I recommend it? If you can avoid being perma banned by a broken automated system, sure I would, but I can't say that is possible.

/Ijustneededtovent /endrant

EDIT: This was originally a reddit post, when I state 2 days ago, I really mean a while ago.
EDIT 2: To all those saying ""just shut up, you cheated admit it, stop lying"" you clearly either haven't played long enough or consistent enough to have the broken automated system touch you in inappropriate places, or you are just that one special snowflake that is so ignorant to all the evidence of false-positives.

												GTA 5 is a great game! But..

Single player mission mode is fun to do and will keep you busy for many many hours..
and then you'll discover..  GTA ONLINE, the online multiplayer world..

Loading the game and get online takes almost 4..5 min and yes, I DO have fast internet!
Often getting online fails, pushing you back to story mode.. making you wait until the storymode is loaded and only then you're able to try to get back online..  :/
After you finally managed to get online, you'll see a cool OPENWORLD environment, you can do whatever you want :)

Except..  the cheater/hacker problem in GTA ONLINE..
They will ruin your game, take away weapons and ammo, spawn crazy stuff on top of you, destroy your cars, teleport you into the ocean or drop out of your plane/helicopter or just set everyone on fire on the server and keep killing everyone until you change server.. and that often doesn't help.
So you have to shut down the game and restart again and guess what?  The LONG waiting to get online, including all the failed tries, start again as well

And what does ROCKSTAR do about all this?
ROCKSTAR does release lots of EYE CANDY projects, but so far, doesn't do a thing about cheaters/hackers.  They don't even react/reply when people mention cheaters/hackers.

So.. the game, without all the cheaters/hackers, needs some serious performance fix for online multiplayer, but yeah.. it's FUN
But... there IS still the cheater/hacker problem and as long ROCKSTAR doesn't do a thing about this, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone."

												Was permanently banned for no reason from their GTA Online servers. Contacted their support via ticket, and was told 'the ban was permanent', and they closed the ticket. Called their support, even told them I had video proof of not cheating, and they said 'the ban is permanent', and hung up on me.

EDIT: Because people were complaining about a 7 1/2 hour video (something I did to show my transition from working to playing GTA) I've uploaded the video to YouTube. The video has cut out me working, and goes straight to moments before I open Steam, and run GTA, to the moment I get banned:

			Not sure if audio is synced properly, but I don't care enough to re-render the 15GB video file. TL;DR: Opened the game on Steam, made a new character, played for 3 and a half hours.		
	



Despite being permanently banned for absolutely no reason, the game's online experience is horrible, littered with cheaters and frequent disconnects and bugs. Loading screen takes about four minutes, even on an SSD. Missions get canceled as players get booted from the online service due to Rockstar's terrible online servers. Joining sessions with your friends are hit-and-miss, and you'll likely get kicked offline to single-player many times while joining any online session, only to be greeted by the four-minute loading screen again. You can actually see this problem occur in my video. The game never logs in the first time I create my character, and I have to do it again. It's about ten minutes before I even get to play.

If you choose to buy the game, do it for the single-player campaign. The characters in the game are likeable and well-designed, and the missions are pretty fun to do. If you're buying the game for the online experience, don't expect anything at all besides a horrible time. Thankfully for me, I don't really care about being banned from GTA, as I only bought it for single-player in the first place and have beaten the campaign and gotten most of the achievements. I typically don't review products, but I thought it was important for others to know there's a possibility of being banned without warning and without reason."

												The PC version of GTA V is definitely the best version. We had to wait really long, but the game finally came out in a fantastic state. Rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the PC port/version. I'm usually against pre-ordering games, but I made one exception this year for GTA, and im happy with my decision. I didn't do it for the pre-order bonus (because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat) , I did it just so I could preload all GB's in time for launch, because the game is ridiculously big. 

I'm running it at 60-90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on ""high"", except for the advanced options, which is something you should only use if your running SLI or one really good card. I have a Nvidia gtx 680, which is a few years old now, so im very impressed with how good I can get the game to run. You can also use GeForce experience with GTA, because Nividia released a update for that day before launch.

You can play GTA in first or third person mode, and simply change between them on your controller. All cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person. Some textures are a little blurry in first person, but that is something to expect in a game of this size. Fighting, swimming, walking can also be done in first person, so you can just pick what you like the best.

If you have an SSD drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for GTA, because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long. It's one of the only complains I have with GTA actually. Thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online, because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens.

Singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written. You can swap between them in the open world, but also in certain quests. Michael, Trevor and Franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then GTA IV's only character, Niko.

GTA online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in. I really just bought it for the single-player experience, but after playing a few hours with my friends I have to say that GTA online is actually really fun. I think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run, but to play free-roam with friends will never get old. You also unlock heist in level 12, so that might refresh things even more.

I play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends I've talked to is doing the same thing. I strongly recommend it, at least for the driving. You can enable auto-aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard, or you can swap between your keyboard+mouse in combat, and use controller for driving. When you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates, which I think makes you feel more immersed in the game.

I tried the PC controls and I didn't like them at all. For example you have to hit ""Z"" to see how many players are on your server in online mode. You can however rebind all keys on keyboard, mouse, and controller so thats really good, but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid.

GTA is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come. I have already played it a lot and I feel like I have much more leveling to do in GTA online, much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come. Singleplayer was all I really needed, so I will just see GTA online as a plus.

Well done Rockstar! This is the best PC version you have ever made and I can see that you put a lot of effort, time and love into creating it. Strongly recommend this title to all my friends, whether your the single or multiplayer guy, you will have a ton of fun. This will probably be one of the best games released this year."

												Updated review.


After so many hours of playing I can tell you with absolute certainty that GTA Online is a big piece of crap filled with pretty pixels. The whole online infrastucture is so frikkin bad that it sucks any possible fun you could have in the game right out of you.  And still up today R* keeps releasing new pixel junk updates on the same piece of crap online p2p infrastructure to milk the consumers even more... with no intention at all to really improve the whole online experience. 
 
Online experience: 
 
Start the game. Get a 2 minute loading screen. Choose online mode. Get a 2 minute loading screen. You are logged into a session without any other players. Okay fine, lets do a quick race then against some players. Choose quick race. 2 minute loading screen.'No active race could be found'. Only options in the menu you have now is 'host a race' or 'join a random mission'. Choose host a race. .... loading screen. You are dropped in a random race alone. Set 'auto invite' active. wait 10 minutes and still nobody to race with. You escape out of the session and go back to freeroam. 2 minute loading screen. Okay back at freeroam, check for other players. Nope, you are again in a session alone. So lets do the 'random race' again. ... and you get where I am going at. You get the same frikking loading screen crap and again the terrible barely functioning p2p matchmaking bull crap. Imagine doing this for 10 hours, imagine doing this for a 100 or a 1000 hours.  And in the mean time R* tries to get you to buy sharkcards ,because they made all the cars etc intentionally expensive... and then you have to grind for ingame money in this piece of crap online infrastructure. What a joke!

Story mode: Really cool, love it! even more a shame that R* abandoned story mode completely and went for online mode cash grab scheme. 


R*, one of the biggest sell out companies of the last years.


And pls note: I play GTAV on a good gaming rig and with a 200MB fibrewire connection."

												400+ hours online. 

Reported modders/hackers and griefers.

December 19th - Reported a modder who repeatedly teleports to and kills players, or teleported people to him, dropped money on them and stuff.
December 20th - Tried to log in and noticed: ""Banned until 30/12/2015"". Reasons unspecified except for an email with a rather ""broad"" explanation, stating I ""cheated"".

By the end of January, same ♥♥♥♥. Got banned because... reasons?

And by Mid-June, got permanently banned because... reasons too? Apparently they didn't remove the hacker money I got, even though I reported it to them. So after selling a car I had bought in like December or so, they banned me on grounds of earning money ""unfairly"" - selling something I had for 6 months or more. 

GG Rockstar. 10/10 - Keep on being that nice to your customers and gamers."

												Pre-ordered this game straight away when it first came to steam. Been playing it back and forth for 330 hours total. I had a ton of fun playing with friends and just doing stuffs online. Then all of a sudden i got a ban after i got the X80 Prot car (Or whatever it's called). A 1 week ban. I made a ticket and got a automatic bot reply. Waited for the ban to disappear to go in again. Then I notice all my money is gone (they wipe your account when you get a ban) so I started playing a heist with my brother and some friends. On the last part of the heist, I got another ban for 1 month. I still don't know what it is I am doing that's against their rules. I make 4 tickets in hope of getting a reason for my ban and all I get are bot replies. After a while, I manage to do a ticket with the title ""connectivity issues"" and explained that I was afraid to log in cus I didn't want another ban, and this time, I get a reply from a person. This person said ""we do not know the reason since it's a bot that's banning people"" and calmly said ""but you shouldn't be afraid to log in."". I trusted this guy so I logged in after my 1 month ban and managed to play for a day. HOWEVER on the next day I started playing, I got a PERMANENT ban and I still have NO clue whatsoever what I got banned for. Talked with some guys in a GTA group and they said I will most likely not get unbanned. *NOTE* I was NOT modding, cheating or abusing anything in the game at all. Pure vanilla version of the game. *END NOTE*

The Game is very fun to play with friends, BUT their anti cheat system bans people for nothing and the Support gives no ♥♥♥♥ whatsoever to help or explain what might be the issue.

If you can look past the risk of getting randomly banned and having cheaters nuking you anywhere in the world, then you might have a good time. I don't recommend it cus I think Rockstar don't deserve the money when they clearly don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about their community."

												GTAV online is pure ♥♥♥♥.

A typical use case looks like this. 
Start up GTAV on my top end maxed out super desktop.
Wait 15 minutes before getting into online
It doesn't auto join sessions with friends.
Tell it to join session with friends.
Wait some more.
We try to do a heist.
Spend 20 minuites driving to get into the same area.
A guy in a flying tank at level 8000 kills us and spawns a giant UFO on us. 
Get killed a few times against the invincible hacker.
Change session.
Doesn't automatically add you to session with friends.
GTAV Kicks me out to single player. 
Join session with friends.
Spend 20 minutes driving to meet up. Go to so-n-so's house for a heist. 
Watch ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cinema that we have all seen like 30 times because you have to grind heists daily to make ok Money.
Start waiting room for heist.
Friend is kicked out to single player.
Need 4 players for heist.
Kicked out of heist.
Go outside to meet up again.
Dude in flying car drops $1,000,000 on friend.
Ok? Weird
Start heist for real this time.
30 minutes in, friend that recieves money is banned. 
Kicked out of heist
Sigh
Lets just mess with other players and shoot cops.
Meet up again, get kicked into my own session.
Join session with friends
zooms in on the single player dude fighting with his girlfriend.

This sums up my experience. Today, I was finally the guy that had a hacker drop money on them and I earned my first ban.

												You won't find worse customer support anywhere, and at the same time you won't find any other game with as much paid marketeers as this one. Fanboys that will defend their employer till death claiming this game and its administration are perfect.

Multiplayer is cancer. A hacker can spawn 500 moneybags on your head and he'll never get detected. There is no way for you NOT to pick up the money as its picked up automatically. The moment you involuntary pick up the money - you're ♥♥♥♥ed.

Nowhere on the game or its description or manual does it say that you're required to report the money to be removed by Rockstar. Even if you do go and try to report it on Rockstar's support site - it doesn't work. The submit button hasn't been working in months. You're basically ♥♥♥♥ed.

Rockstar uses 3 strikes system which would be okay if they wouldn't ban you 3 times for the exactly the same ♥♥♥♥ because they're too mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to revoke the cash you recieved from your first strike


You planning on buying this for your younger brother? Don't.
A hacker will have him banned permanently within a month

												GTA V is a great game, a real achievement for the gaming industry. One of those games that deserves to be recorded, saved and displayed on a museum for all humanity. This is definitely the best version of the game, best graphics, FPS option, mods and etc. 


BUT (and this is a big but), the new anti-cheating mechanism, which was long overdue since cheating is rampant, is now generating a lot of false positives. That is, players that don't cheat or engage in illegal activities are being banned for one month without a specific reason. No one is really certain on what triggers this ban, some say Discord, Xplit, OBS and even Windows 10 Recording might be the culprit. As if that was not enough the worst part is the response from Rockstar, after the ban and you try to open a ticket to resolve the issue, they have already placed an automated response denying any form of contest. Like DONT EVEN TRY, NO ONE IS EVER GOING TO READ YOUR CLAIM.

This is completely ridiculous and a shame, and probably an unethical consumer stance. The game is really amazing and GTA Online is getting better content every month, unfortunately the customer service and the anti-cheating is a big stain on Rockstar’s track record...

If you buy this game now, you are running a big risk on getting a ban out of blue, and not being able to play it online. I would avoid it for the time being."

												[Newer Review]

The Actual Final Update for my Grand Theft Auto Online Review. [12/11/2016]: Trainer Users are still there, Rockstar still does nothing about them but put up bans they can avoid, and get ban happy to third party apps, the wheels keep turning, don't bother buying this game on PC for online, it's a terrible Idea. 
DO NOT BUY IT ON PC FOR ONLINE.

 In addition, here's a minor list of things that can and will get you banned from GTA: Online

- Used a memory optimization program (CleanMem, Razor Cortex, etcetera)

- Attempting to force AA or other graphical effects through your drivers

- Using a Field of View mod (They actually lied about saying this is acceptable)

- Having any file in the GTA folder that was not shipped with the game (Literally anything)

- Leftover log files from singleplayer mods

- Discord when it hooks into a game via an Overlay can get you banned

[Trainers don't get banned since they hide the way they hook into the game.]

			looks like francis got banned from Grand Theft Auto 5, for modding the game. He didn't cheat in GTA online, but he did mod the game for single player.		
	
 (Fun little videos)

 I ran Both Cleanmem and Razor Cortex and got banned in 4 hours after playing with some friends, a little while after watching someone use a trainer. I narrowly missed getting Discord Thrown in with those two.

There's a lot of people calling out falsely for bans but if you search around for specific reasons you find a ton of people getting banned from very specific explainable things.

This multi-million dollar company will never spend the money to make a valuable port, or put in proper Anti-Cheat, don't trust them.

[7/20/2016]: A bit over year later Rockstar finally updates their game enough to consider that it has a bit of Anti-Cheat now to ban people at a faster rate and prevent cheats from the start and is working quite well considering many haven't seen many script users, I've seen at least 2 but it has been very spaced out and only briefly using it very blatantly, it has helped it out a lot to not have said issues persist as strong as they used to and I can recommend it, but I won't take down this review since it took over a year to lock-down the issues and still not have a statement on it, or anything else to say why it took so long, the game is harder to mod for the better and the worst because of their implementations, modding the game will trigger the anti-cheat they are using and ban the user, so if you have any interest in modding and online you can only pick between the two and stick with it, otherwise your SOL.

As a final note I would recommend picking the game up for 30 Dollars, or Less, it's a fun game and it's a little less toxic with the removal of rampant use of mod menus and general scripts, at full price I can't recommend it if your interested in online, it's toxic as any game would be with such free reign, but if you enjoy being aggressive towards other players then it's fine and full price is acceptable, SP is still as good as ever but MP is still brought down a bit with the player base being really trigger happy and aggressive to ♥♥♥♥ every ones ♥♥♥♥ up whether they are interested, or not.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

[Oldest Review]

Don't get the game for Online, Until Rockstar adds some sort of SERIOUS Anti-Cheat, The Online Portion is absolutely ruined.

If your looking for a open world game with an interesting SINGLE Player Story, Or Private Multiplayer with friends, Then this is for you, But if your looking for some drop in and have some open world fun with 30 players, Expect to be abruptly blown up, Gain Millions in cash, Lose said millions in cash, Gain guns you never bought, Lose said guns you never bought, And then have your car deleted all from users playing with trainers.

Rockstar Cares about your cash, Not your experience in the game, Dont buy it for half the game, Buy it for the full game when they actually make half the game playable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATES TO ISSUES THAT PLAGUE HALF THE GAME:

12/16/2015: Update: There's already a work around with trainers, Unknown if their system is working forward to banning them after a bit.

12/15/2015: Update: Nothing has exceptionally changed for the better, Recent Patch Notes say that they have updated and tweaked their anti-cheat measures, Ussually trainers would be up and running in a few hours, So far nothing has come up.

7/11/2015: UPDATE TO TRAINERS: Players using scripts and what not can now go invisible and hide themselves from others entirely, Add that onto the ability to launch others into the air at a whim, Or having molitovs explode on them, As well as exploding, the only thing actively being gaurded right now is the money, And that's still being shot out from miniguns, Or simply dropped onto player's heads.

To gather information if you wish to report a player, the best option is to find a TV ingame and use spectate to report a player that is invisible, They can still be seen even if their husk isn't visible.

6/16/2015: UPDATE TO SO CALLED ""ANTI-CHEAT"": The script creators already found an easy workaround around the brief scan, It's stopped all money drops long term because they are monitoring it a bit more heavily, But they can do everything else in between still, I'm still suggesting anyone to really think about getting the game.

6/10/2015: UPDATE TO THE TRAINER ISSUE: The issue still persists to this date, But is now raised to where Users of said Trainers are targeting players calling out users and reporting players using trainers to rockstar, They can remove the bans placed against them, They can remove all in-game reports on them, They've ruined Online, I implore you to reconsider at all costs as to buying GTA 5 For online, They have so much power in Online and rockstar is not showing any hint of helping out the common player on GTA besides for giving us cash for the cars/ammo/guns we have lost and saying, ""Sorry for your inconvenience."", Perhaps they've forgotten who makes their games so popular.

------------------------------------------------------------------

[Summary]
------------
 The game has massive issues with memory tied to a leak that has persisted from launch, and just overall hogs a lot of memory, do not tamper with anything related to the game with how it handles memory, you will get banned. 

 My Final Words as someone whos played Grand Theft Auto since I was a child is don't grab this game on PC, it's not worth it at all, better graphics be damned, the game has so many issues on PC that Rockstar should be ashamed to have put such a title out, but that doesn't matter in the end they'll get sales, they'll meet their qoutas, time will continue on with them getting more and more sales.

I finish my time with Grand Theft Auto 5 as a series with 1,455 Hours that I wish I never had logged on to buy it on PC, I won't be buying another game of theirs again with how poor they treat their customers and how poorly they treat PC entirely from removing content from San Andreas and removing music/ruining performance on a 10 year old game, poor performance with GTA4, and then just poor treatment of their customers with their support and ban happy treatment to users in an attempt to keep online safe while still neglecting adding in true Anti-Cheat.

------------

TL;DR: Online Portion Ruined by Trainers, minor things get you banned, Single Player is Absolutely Amazing if you like the GTA Series and ""good"" Characters."

												Hi.

This is about my first serious review, and I'll try to advise you if it's worth it or not to buy the game, based on my personal   opinion.
As you probably know, GTA has two kind of game modes, Online and Story mode and I'll judge both.

PLEASE REMEMBER, this is my personal opinion and everything is based on what I feel about the game, and I'll undersand and respect yours aswell.

- Story Mode -

Catchy story-mode.
Somewhat fun and dynamic questline.
Some nostalgic feels.
Balanced prices and easy fun.
Huge map, but feels somewhat empty.

My opinion - 

 It's pretty standard, same grab this kill that, race this kind of missions, but is it good? 
 From my point of view, it can be fun, though it lacks the "" Gta San Andreas "" vibes, but hey, it's a new game.
 If you came for the ol'gangbanging drive-by feel, it will let you down, mostly it's big game moves, stealing banks and others.
 But, apart from that, and that you can't get all the 'online' perks and dlc stuff, it's a pretty fun single player.
 
- Online  -
Huge open world, tho some of it lacks content.
Huge grind to get money.
Almost everything overpriced.
♥♥♥♥♥♥ community ( Imagine COD's and Minecraft community togheter, yeah ).
Free DLC's but really expensive in-game content.
Hackers and modded accounts.
Bad servers with huge loading times and frequent lost connections.
Weak UI, somewhat challenging to get around.
Game-modes feel straight up pushed into the game "" just to add content "".
Races are fun!                                       ...kinda.

||| - I understand that my views towards the online mode are mostly money centered, but without cash, you can't get around really. You need money for bullets, money for cars, money for houses, money for almost everything, it's the Lifeblood of the game. - |||

 
So in my opinion :

 The online feels like a massive grind. You'll get around but it just feels like you'll never enjoy the game to it's fullest without money. 
 The community is just random, either they  wont ever bother to talk to you or straight up blow up everything you love and care about.
It really feels like a pay to win game.
 Did I mention the hackers and modded accounts that will make you feel poor?
New DLC out! Great! What new content will I try? Oh, I can't really afford any. 
Alright, I got really side-tracked there, sorry.
I used to love GTA, but it feels that they've went way to greedy on everything and basic things that could be done to fix the game or improve it are shunned upon by the creators and instead we are given ever more expensive content to either buy shark cards or grind for 4 hours straight to get ONE CAR. It's just not the kind of game I wouldn't buy, and yes, I regret buying it.
-----------------------------


Thank you for stopping by, I hope this helped you in anyway, take your time to read other reviews and don't stick with just one, remember this is my opinion and yours might differ from mine. 

Good luck and Cheers :)"

												Long story short, after over 600 hours of gameplay (most of which is online, my character was around level 214), I get suspended for no discernable reason and my character reset. 

November 8th: Me and a few friends decided to try the new Deadline game mode after messing around in a private free mode lobby for a while. We do this, and when were done, I got sent in to a public game for about a minute before I quit the game. Approximately two hours later, I get an email saying my account broke the EULA and terms of service, and I have been suspended for 30 days and my stats reset. Why? I have never once cheated/hacked/modified my game files. If I had to guess, there was probably a hacker in the public game I was in, and I was in just long enough to get dragged along with him. All the horror stories about getting suspended are true, I found out. I tried contacting support and got a copy/paste response about how the ban system works. My friend also contacted them and got a name for me to ask for, even going to the length of calling their support hotline and speaking to a (rather cocky) employee who told him that I would have to call (the entire call was also recorded). It was late at night at the time I heard about it so instead of calling, I sent in another ticket explaining in detail what happened, and mentioned his ticket number and the persons name...same response. Thanks Rockstar for taking over 600 hours of gameplay away from me for no real reason. I loved GTA Online, but after this, I am never buying any of your products again.

My boyfriend and another friend of mine made videos on it if anyone is curious.

												Rockstar told us the PC-version would be the ultimate version and they were right. I just love this game, the heists, the missions.. everything! 10/10 and it's running smooth. :) 

Pros: 
Beautiful graphics and city
Optimized game for pc
3 character switch
Smooth gameplay
Hours of fun
GTA online.


Cons:
Rockstar Support
No cloud save for story mode.
Rockstar social club integration itself.
Taking a long time to load sometimes."

												My first day in Grand Theft Auto V:

● I accidently blew up a truck - > Mission failed
● I tried to kill and run towards the enemies - > Instantly died
● I drove a car - > Got stuck or destroyed the car
● I raced with the car - > Did not even finish the first lap while the others finished all of them
● I ran after the civilians - > I did not keep up
● I went swimming - > I drowned within 30 seconds
● I flew a plane - > Crashed it within 30 seconds
● I flew a helicopter - > It started to smoke within 1 minute

And I still loved the game

Now I got the hang of it and today's experience is:

● Awesome radio stations
● Awesome strip club and strippers
● Awesome tv channels (aliens, furries and all that weirdgood stuff)
● Awesome movies at the cinema
● Awesome graphics, lightning and city
● Awesome gameplay (heists, missions, races etc)
● Awesome hours of laughing and tears
● Awesome game, I am still amazed by how the game looks like
● Awesome to play with and without friends
● Awesome ♥♥♥♥ing story! I have finished the story, it was great! (Way better missions and heists)

Also note that:

● You can point your middle finger to anyone. If you are on a bike, car, boat, anything!
● You can pick up hockers during the night. (Note that they often wear red clothes).
● You can easily lose the cops by driving off-road. If that does not work just call creepy uncle Lester♥, he will help you out!

Remember, we are all noobs at first.
GTA V is definetly worth the money

												Alright boys and girls, super salty rant time. This game is not worth the money if you want it for Online only. I repeat, if you are only interested in Online, *DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME* there have been a lot of false bans being issued recently and R* DOES NOT care if you were falsely banned. I have been banned for 4 days now and I have written 4 tickets to support, three of which have recieved the same response. Two were from a bot, the third was a real person but still the same response. I don't have a god damn clue why I was banned because Ive never modded, never exploited, and never even recieved money from any other players. The only thing Ive done in the game is cuss some guy out because he called me a f aggot after I said he was salty. Supposedly you can be banned for being overly racist, homophobic, or disrespectful towards a religion... I cussed someone out for using homophobic slurs. I defended homosexuals while he bashed them. So, if that warrants a ban, ♥♥♥♥ me right? Ive done everything I could to contact R* support INCLUDING the 4 support tickets (as mentioned above), a forum post, tweets @ and DM's to both their support and games accounts, and Ive even called the support line over 100 times, only to never talk to a human. All Ive asked for in my tickets/dms/posts/whatever is a reason for being banned, or a removal of the ban. Yet Im still no closer to understanding why I was banned. IF and ONLY if I hear back from support BEFORE my ban is automatically lifted, I will alter this review to reflect upon it. But as of right now, I cannot recommend this game for anyone only interested in the Online feature. As of this particular point in time, I wont be playing Online until I get a response from R* support telling me why I was banned in the first place, because Ive read many a post about people being banned, not knowing why, then getting banned again after attempting to play Online again. 

Go ahead and say what you want, Im sure I'll get lots of ""You cheated, you got caught, deal with it."" comments, but I know that I havent broken any rules and I could honestly care less what people assume of me.

EDIT: They never got back to me. BUT, I would like to say that a few of the known programs that can trigger a false ban are things like TeamSpeak, Discord, and Skype as well as (possibly) Steams FPS counter or recording software like Bandicam and Fraps."

												Rockstar decided to become greedy at the sight of the sweet, sweet steam summer sale. 0/10 would not recommend again.

****Update****

Okay, so some people don't understand why people are mad that the base game is not on sale. When Steam's Summer Sale first began, the base game of GTA V was on sale for $30, but it was only at that price for roughly 10-20 minutes. Instead of keeping it at that price, they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale, which, as countless others have stated, is shady business. I'm not mad that the base game isn't on sale; it's their right as a company to not have to put it on sale. I'm just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics."

												The singleplayer is excellent as well as the multiplayer portion of the game when you are playing with friends doing jobs and heists and having a fun time messing around in the open world of Los Santos. Everything else is a freaking mess. If the grind doesn't get you, then be prepared to meet the community. One side are the legit hackers that ruin the game with their God Mode and one shot everything in their path with merely peashooters. On another side will be griefers that will do anything to give you a bad day in a public lobby. One another side would be the actual community whose toxicity is worse than the kids on either the CoD or BF community that fondles R*'s balls and blindly believes that all legit players that were falsely banned are hackers. There is no way to reason with them even though there is hard proof. A word of advice, either do a private lobby or grab some friends or trusted people (heh, as if that would apply to the majority of the GTA:O community)"

												raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for ""sale"" at the same price as before. Way to be cheap R*

To help the simple people who don't get it understand. The problem is this is how they treat their customers, you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters, overpriced content, and credit card unlocks. Essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other pay-to-win free games. Sorry for the ambiguity, I supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect."

												""He sits on his ♥♥♥ all day, smoking dope and jerking off while he plays that ♥♥♥♥ing game. If that's our standard for goodness... then no wonder this country's screwed."" - Michael De Santa

STORY (No Spoilers)Grand Theft Auto V pits the player into the roles of the three main protagonists: Michael, a married man suffering from a midlife crisis, Franklin, a gangster trying to make a change for himself, and Trevor, who's just a Canadian psychopath. The trio get together and perform all sorts of daring heists and escapades.

The game is action-packed with chases, gang shootouts, and intense heists that get crazier as the game goes on.
When you're not robbing a convenience store or shooting rednecks, you can partake in all sorts of activities. You can walk your dog—Chop, go golfing, play tennis, and even get a lap dance at the strip club (Sorry Roman, there's no bowling)!

GTA ONLINE:
The GTA Online Protagonist can be created according to the taste of the player to customize (gender or appearance). The player will choose a gender, then choose the parents and grandparents of the character to affect his/her appearance. Then, the player chooses how much the character spends his/her daily life; this will create the initial stats for the character and slightly change the appearance.

After you have finished creating your character, you arrive in Los Santos with an open welcome by Lamar Davis (Especially if you're a female). He then has you do a street race with him (and other new players, if available), and shows you to Gerald, a drug runner who'll give you easy jobs to start you off in Los Santos. After you complete this tutorial, you'll join a free roam session with up to 32 other players (Who'll either become your friend or your enemy).

There are multiple game modes in Online, including:
Free Roam - Run around with up to 32 of your closest friends (or enemies), causing chaos and other nonsense. You can also compete in mini-games, such as target practice, arm wrestling, golf, and tennis. If you don't like to be killed constantly by other players in Free Roam, you can play in Solo Mode, but you'll be unable to play game modes that require more than one player.
Missions - These are given out by characters in GTAV (Lamar, Gerald, Martin, etc.), and are co-op jobs with up to 4 players.
Survival - Try to survive up to ten waves of enemies with 3 other players.
PVP - There are multiple subsets of this, including: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch (Free for all), Vehicle Deathmatch, Team Elimination (You only have one life.), Capture (A twist to Capture the Flag), Objective-based missions (Complete a objective, while the enemy team tries to do the same), races, and parachuting.
Heists - These are my personal favourite. With up to three of your friends (friends are highly recommended, unless you want to fail the heist repeatedly), you can perform challenging and rewarding missions to obtain lots of cash and exclusive heist vehicles. Unlike basic jobs, these heists involve multiple sub-jobs within them called Heist Setups that must be completed prior to the Heist Finale. As the heist leader, you can set what crew member does what job and their pay for doing that job. Teamwork is essential because the entire team shares one extra life (or none at all if the dificulty is above normal), and if that life is expended, the current mission fails and you'll have to restart it.
There are multiple glitches in GTA Online, some are funny and weird, the others are exploits and game-breaking. So far I haven't seen any hackers, but I wouldn't doubt their existence.

Final VerdictIn retrospect, I give Grand Theft Auto V a 9/10
+ Amazing story
+ Excellent gameplay
+ Fun with friends, and fun without them!
+ Great graphics
+ GTA Editor
+ Heists are fun and replayable for more cash
- Glitches

												The game is so-so. While it's the magnum opus GTA, the pc port is a bit of hit&miss. I, for one, have heavy graphical bugs whenever it rains.

Also, going to have to give it a negative review for bumping the price up and then pretending it was on a generous summer sale. Seriously, doesn't gaming industry have a single bit of ethics left anywhere?"

												Price jacked up for ""sale"". The port is good and I had thought they had redeemed themselves into the PC market since GTA4 was a disaster but this cash grab is the last straw for me. I'd request a refund if I was eligible. They can't keep on taking and taking from us and giving nothing in return. We the consumer are being taken for granted.

We shouldn't be giving our hard earned money to developers like this, if you really want to spend this sort of money on a game then chuck in another couple of quid and buy Witcher 3 where the developer really does care about its consumer. Witcher 3 is worth every single penny."

shady ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s think you can get away with pulling a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ trick like this? You made alot of people disapointed rockstar.

I know atleast 27 people IRL who were waiting for steam summer sale to buy gta v.

Do math: (59.99-(59.99*.25))= about 45 dollars per game.

Now multiply by 27 and you get an easy 1215 dollars. Now you get none of that money because of your shady ♥♥♥ taticts.

You should be ashamed in yourself rockstar... Such a great game and you have the audacity to pull a gimic like this. I thought pc games had the definitive edition of GTA... Thought wrong I guess."

												GTA 5 is a great game! But..

Single player mission mode is fun to do and will keep you busy for many many hours..
and then you'll discover..  GTA ONLINE, the online multiplayer world..

Loading the game and get online takes almost 4..5 min and yes, I DO have fast internet!
Often getting online fails, pushing you back to story mode.. making you wait until the storymode is loaded and only then you're able to try to get back online..  :/
After you finally managed to get online, you'll see a cool OPENWORLD environment, you can do whatever you want :)

Except..  the cheater/hacker problem in GTA ONLINE..
They will ruin your game, take away weapons and ammo, spawn crazy stuff on top of you, destroy your cars, teleport you into the ocean or drop out of your plane/helicopter or just set everyone on fire on the server and keep killing everyone until you change server.. and that often doesn't help.
So you have to shut down the game and restart again and guess what?  The LONG waiting to get online, including all the failed tries, start again as well

And what does ROCKSTAR do about all this?
ROCKSTAR does release lots of EYE CANDY projects, but so far, doesn't do a thing about cheaters/hackers.  They don't even react/reply when people mention cheaters/hackers.

So.. the game, without all the cheaters/hackers, needs some serious performance fix for online multiplayer, but yeah.. it's FUN
But... there IS still the cheater/hacker problem and as long ROCKSTAR doesn't do a thing about this, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone."

												 YOU WILL NOT GET BANNED FOR USING MODS IN SP, ONLY MP. THEY DO NOT HAVE A MAGIC TURN OFF BUTTON WHEN YOU GO ONLINE 
Do not listen to the popular review circlejerk, they are arrogant idiots who did not realize that  all  mods were not permitted online, yes, even FoV ones as silly as it sounds. It is justified as it's a unauthorized modification to the game's code which is a breach of GTA online's use.

God, I hate bandwagoning in Steam sometimes...

EDIT: Oh and the game's alright if you want to buy it 9/10.

OH A SECOND EDIT!

I have tried mods, and I have not been banned."

												Well, hackers got to the point where they use my name to kill all others on the server. So people think its me who is hacking. Besides that, the hacker succeeded in putting me in a death-loop, where i endlessly die. On top of that, he succesfully crashed my game, probably with an invalid texture input.

Eventhough i have lots of fun playing , this is an issue that needs to be solved."

												GTA ONLINE is banning everyone for doing nothing.  my friend was banned and so was a lot of people at the time. don't buy this game or play the Online stay safe becuase rockstar doesn't care about you. 

Update : if you comment something like they don't ban people for no reason. I will remove your comment and I will ask you to hook the discord overlay into your GTA use XSPLIT or delete one texture file. Go ahead they don't ban you if your not cheating right ;) just do it. 

I also made a video on the subject that can be seen here.

												Price gouging/hiking/inflation as well as Product-Tying is a crime in several jurisdictions, and entitles the consumer to a refund for a very blatant, anti-consumer practice. 

If you live in;
Australia (via ACCC)
Canada
Germany
Ireland
United Kingdom (via ASA)
United States (via FTC and Former Price Comparison)
New Zealand (via Fair Trading Act)

If you live in the above countries, you are entitled to a refund if you bought the game during the price-hike/product-tying. If you don't, I recommend you ask a lawyer or equivalent. Although rectified, the act still occured. Because a thief returns a man's property, doesn't mean the crime didn't occur."

												When I bought this game a couple of weeks ago and playing for a while as a Nice Guy character, I couldn't imagine that GTA Online now is the Stalinist Russia Simulator. Every action may be compromised, even if it it's not prohibited, it may be punished but at the same time some of the cheaters can play loose under the protection of modders and spoil community's life. Who are not protected, but not guilty, who are the real victims will stay in GULAG of ban with real lawbreakers and the whole community would perceive them equally, because they don't have an opportunity to know for what they've been banned. With no opportunity to appeal! And after all of thise in a month I'd have to play with permanent fear, with no certainty that if I play fair I would not be punished? 
The problem isn't real, until it concerns you or your friends. Mention it please. And it isn't sacrilege, it's reality.
Btw thank you Rockstar. You made near fascist regime in your small online world. Bravo

Купив на распродаже спустя столько лет после выхода данный продукт ради онлайна, и отыгрывая там дружелюбного парня, я не предполагал, что ГТА онлайн на самом деле является симулятором жизни при Сталинском режиме, когда каждое действие, будь оно названо запрещенным или нет, возможно будет караться, в то время как те кто действительно портят жизнь сообществу свободно будут существовать под защитой моддера, тогда как остальные будут сидеть в общем ГУЛАГе бана наравне с настоящими преступниками, а само это сообщество будет воспринимать их точно так же. Конечно, как будто не было невинно осужденных. Без возможности оспорить ничего! 
И после этого когда бан через месяц пройдет я должен буду продолжить играть без уверенности в том, что честная игра не принесет перманентный бан!
Проблемы нет, пока она не пришла в ваш дом. Примите к сведению. Это не кощунство, это реальность.

												GTAV online is pure ♥♥♥♥.

A typical use case looks like this. 
Start up GTAV on my top end maxed out super desktop.
Wait 15 minutes before getting into online
It doesn't auto join sessions with friends.
Tell it to join session with friends.
Wait some more.
We try to do a heist.
Spend 20 minuites driving to get into the same area.
A guy in a flying tank at level 8000 kills us and spawns a giant UFO on us. 
Get killed a few times against the invincible hacker.
Change session.
Doesn't automatically add you to session with friends.
GTAV Kicks me out to single player. 
Join session with friends.
Spend 20 minutes driving to meet up. Go to so-n-so's house for a heist. 
Watch ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cinema that we have all seen like 30 times because you have to grind heists daily to make ok Money.
Start waiting room for heist.
Friend is kicked out to single player.
Need 4 players for heist.
Kicked out of heist.
Go outside to meet up again.
Dude in flying car drops $1,000,000 on friend.
Ok? Weird
Start heist for real this time.
30 minutes in, friend that recieves money is banned. 
Kicked out of heist
Sigh
Lets just mess with other players and shoot cops.
Meet up again, get kicked into my own session.
Join session with friends
zooms in on the single player dude fighting with his girlfriend.

This sums up my experience. Today, I was finally the guy that had a hacker drop money on them and I earned my first ban.

												Edit: These problems seem to be ocurring less by now, but I'm leaving this review up as a warning to the scummy business practices of Rockstar.
-----------------
People are being banned for no reason and Rockstar agrees with them, yet they are still refusing to reverse the bans or do anything to help. Using Discord, Fraps, Any third party Framerate counter or any program that adds an overlay to your games will result in you getting banned, and support will not reverse it. Heck, if you buy shark cards and they don't work they won't even refund you for that!
Do not support awful business practices like this. Their anti cheat is terrible and their support just wants your money.











EDIT: A lot of people seem to be taking this as ""Waaaah! I got banned!"", so let me clear things up. I have not been banned, I uninstalled the game myself as the hard drive space it took was massive and I didn't play it much. For those who don't believe the large amount of people who have been falsely banned, here are a few more reasons why you shouldn't support R*.

There is a limitless amount of bugs for Online. Ranging from everyone in your session suddenly leaving the game at once, you being booted for no reason, connections timing out randomly, all of these are punctuated with the worst error screen I have ever seen. Instead of presenting you with a simple ""You have timed out"", the game instead spends much time loading up Single player, puts you into the world, and *then* gives you an error message, with an option to rejoin. Which how ludicrously long the load times in this game are, that's a good 2-5 minutes waiting for an error to appear just so you can start waiting again to get back into the game. It is incredibly easy to fix, but rockstar still haven't because they do not care.

There is no server browser. This means that with the endless adversary modes they add, all are dead within a week. The only options you have when in an adversary mode is to invite people of a similar level (which almost never works) and to invite everyone who was in your previous free roam session. If you are playing free roam, would you want to suddenly be pulled into a small mode which likely won't have many players? I thought as much. Thus the modes die off extremely quickly.

And finally, the Anticheat is still terrible. You can have people flying around the map, spawning props locking you in place, dropping money bags on everyone (Which in an amusing way, can result in *them* getting banned) and just generally causing havoc. Every ""attempt"" Rockstar has made has resulted in false positives, and an extremely intolerant system towards modders. You remember how much Rockstar said they ""loved"" the PC Audience and their modders? That's amusing considering they're filling the game with dummy code to confuse them, and you will be instabanned if you go anywhere near Online with the slightest hint of a modification to your game files.

In all, do not support a developer who does not care about their audience. They release modes (The recent Further adventures in Finance and Felony update is a great case for this) that require either for you to grind an unreasonable amount of money, or buy shark cards to make it all easier. Not to mention the adversary modes they throw out are easy to make and take little to no effort, as again, they'll be dead within a few weeks.

You will be better off supporting another company. Move on."

												Great Game, horrible company. I've been banned twice now, the first time for TV remotes in my apartment that were duplicating themselves, and the second time for apparently jumping out of an airplane (This is all me guessing the most plausible cause, since you are given no reason).

And as per usual, Rockstar Support refuses to be cooperative, even to the point of completely closing down their phone line to avoid having to speak to any frustrated player. Submitting a support ticket, even with evidence of your innocence, results in the same bot response and an immediate closing of the ticket. You should essentially expect to be banned at some point if you buy this game.

UPDATE: After my 30 day ban ended, I decided I would play the game once more just to enjoy it before my inevitable permanent ban. And I was entirely correct, because after the entirety of one evening, I wake up to be perma-banned.

Based on when I got the violation notice e-mail, It banned me when I was logging off - when I still had a three star wanted level. Oddly enough, my friend who did the exact same thing (but has no bans on his record) can still play the game. Amusing to say the least."

												I feel I can only write a review for GTA Online, as Grand theft Auto V has been left in the dust since it launched on PC, All of Rockstar's attention goes into GTA Online now. Buying GTA V is basically just a means of distribution for the Online component.

I'm level 99 or something like that, I feel I've played the game long enough to have a solid opinion on it, so let's begin.



- Base game hasn't recieved an update since the first weeks of launch, they don't even port Online cars to it anymore. And they have been actively taking steps to prevent people from spawning online cars in singleplayer. Looks like they don't want you trying something before you spend half a million GTAbucks on it only to find you don't like it. 

- Very few of the updates have added any genuine features or changes, most of the time it's the usual combonation of a new vehicle or two, a gun that no one wants, like the antique pistol for example, and some tacky clothing options.  For an online game that's technically been going for 3 years, there's been very little innovation.

- The whole point of the game is to make money so that you can buy toys, and once you've got everything you want, and once you get bored of the missions, adversary modes and races, and get tired of screwing around in freemode, the game becomes pointless, just a never ending quest to buy more and more overpriced cars and clothing for no better reason than to promote your internet ego, and then realize that everyone else in the game is driving Chrome Adders and sitting on golden Yachts

- Rockstar doesn't think when it comes to implementing game features, the bad sport system is horribly abused. More often than not I find myself getting ""bad sport points"" for doing nothing else but defending myself against an Armoured Kuruma full of raging teenagers who are killing everyone on sight.  Do that enough and all of a sudden you're broke, and forced to play in a lobby full of dunce hatted griefers and cheaters... not that there's any difference between the dunce lobbies and the normal ones, and on the topic of cheating

- The cheating is just insane. it's out of control, Rockstar has lost whatever grip they have on this game, and usually it's not someone cheating in a competitive mode or a co-op mission, more often than not it's just straight out griefing.  Getting C130s dropped on you, cars exploding for no reason, having a gang of stripper NPCs with miniguns spawned on you.  And then you've also got people who spawn moneybags on others, which completely removes any reason for playing legitimately because Rockstar rarely bans, punishes or otherwise goes after anyone who gets hacked money, just the one who spawned it. They slap cheaters on the wrist, often using a strike system, the first 2 or 3 times you're caught, you get banned for a week or two. It should be permanent. There is no excuse for the amount of hacking that goes on in a game of this size

- Free roam is a toxic swamp of internet tough guys, racists, griefers, hackers, tryhards, screamers and squeakers. Freeroam was supposed to be the place where you get to show off, and play with all the things you earned during your missions, and you're extremley hard pressed to find a lobby that isn't full of hackers, Raging griefers with tanks, or one with a blood raging argument going on over voice/chat.

GTA Online is like one of the seven circles of hell, it's a circle of hell reserved for the morons and half-wits who get off to a toxic, unforgiving and completeley malicious enviornment.

It's a shame, because GTA V isn't that bad of a game,  I think GTA IV was ahead of it's time, and I still enjoy it even though it doesn't run too well anymore for some reason.   but GTA V has largely been forgotten since it first launched, because in this industry, if an action game isn't an online game, it's irrelevant.

GTA V: An impressive technical achievement, hit some nails on the head, missed some others compared to it's predecessors.

GTA Online: A toxic pisshole that should be avoided at all costs."

All GTA Online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed.

												STOP BUYING SHARK CARDS!! Rockstar has made over 3 billion dollars off GTA 5 and at least half a billion is from shark cards.  With all that money they are still unwilling to put any real effort towards solving the hacking problem. They can't find any safe guards against it and won't hire moderators for the sessions. You can only report individual hackers and not a hacked session. Most of the time you won't know who is hacking the session. And be warned, this GTA online hacking problem is not over exaggerated.  It is unbelievably rampant. It's literally in nearly all sessions. Wanna do the new CEO or biker missions, prepare to have a modder take control of your vehicle and kill you, making the hours of work you did be for nothing. You really need to prepare yourself for the reality that you will do hours of work and have it completely ruined by modders. This will guarantee-ably happen to you if you play GTA online. It's actually gotten so bad that hacker paranoia has set in everywhere. People are calling each other hackers everywhere you go in the game. Rockstar does not deserve anymore money until they make some progress with this huge problem."

												  Grand Theft Auto V  
Well, I played GTA V before on PS3 and I loved every moment of it,
I played it allot on PS3, about 75 hours on story mode and 80 hours on multiplayer.
It's not much but as I said, I liked it a lot.

So... the moment we have been waiting for!
Grand Theft Auto V on PC!

I bought it again for PC 
because I want get the best experience that this game can give
and play with my best friends that have only PC.

I have GTX 780 Ti and it runs well on it, decent fps.

Story mode is great
and characters are even better (like in every R games).
In this game, we will have 3 main character

[A bit of spoilers]
 Michael De Santa A retired bank robber, who,
after making a deal with the FIB,
moves alongside his family to Los Santos,
where they live in a nice mansion. 
 
 Franklin Clinton A young man who dreams of becoming big-time in Los Santos,
in a world where the glory days of street gangs has long passed. 
He works as a repo man for a car dealership,
but his ambition makes him tired of the job.

 Trevor Phillips Is a mentally unstable guy and bank robber.
A former military pilot, he based himself in Sandy Shores,
where he founded Trevor Philips Enterprises,
which mainly deals with weapons and drugs. (He's my favourite character).


 Grand Theft Auto Online Multiplayer with a lot of stuff to do (if it works).

 Game Modes 

	- Free Mode - my favourite thing to do in this game!
	- Deathmatch
	- Race (including standard, GTA and Rally modes)
	- Capture
	- Survival
	- Hold
	- Contend
	- Raid
	- Parachuting

You can have fun killing civilians 
or just chill and ride your car around beautiful places (what I like to do).

Heists are additional GTA Online missions 
that you can complete with your friends or with random people.
It's really cool and a lot of fun,
you will probably enjoy it!

So the conclusion is
that you must have this if you're a PC gamer,
as this game has almost everything (killing to racing).


The verdict is a Must have game
that you will enjoy playing alone or with friends.
As I said thousands of times,
it is fun and epic!

 Enjoy and have fun!

												After 1380 hours ingame, mostly online, never cheated, always hated and reported the cheaters in GTA I got banned for 1 month with absolutely no reason. I didnt even unknowingly got money by standing afk and getting money dropped on me. I mostly played in private sessions or ""low populated"" lobbies because of all the annoying 10 year old internet warriors.

I grinded so much, soooo much and enjoyed almost every aspect of the game, gameplay mechanics especially. Meaning, I was a loyal ""customer"" to this game, to Rockstar, and as respons in my ticket asking why I got banned I didnt even get a correct answer, ""youre banned"" and it's final. They ban people for no reason!!!!!!!!!!!

Last big hammer wave was a few months ago, and coincidentally short after that, the game was on sale. Shady eh.

Sadly, even though GTA is a great serie and the ideas they had for GTAV were really nice, I cannot recommend this game anymore. Come on, they ban ppl for no reason and RESET EVERYTHING you have earned, that's enough said."

												Would I recommend Grand Theft Auto V: Yes - well made game.
Would I recommend Grand Theft Auto Online: No - here's why:

I logged on earlier today only to find I have been permanently banned (ironically I was looking at the recent reviews moments beforehand and wondering what they were talking about). Now I myself have fallen victim to a ridiculous fault in the game itself.

Did I break the rules? No
Was I given a reason/date/any information? No
Could I appeal? No

When I tried to appeal, not once but twice, I received an automated response (under new regulations) that I could not appeal from a ban.

Advice: If you planning on buying this game for singeplayer, go ahead. If you were planning to delve into GTA online...don't. If you do, all I can advise is: to play in friendly lobbies, don't record your gameplay, make sure your internet is 100% stable, never play missions with random people or do anything publically.

As you can see this is very limiting, but any one of these reasons could have gotten me banned. Rockstar has the worst anti-cheat system I have ever seen and I did not expect to buy the game and be unable to play it after spending around 500 hours on it (which makes it all the more bitter). It is honestly such a shame that they had to ruin a fun game, fortunately there are other games that will not disappoint you as much as this one."

In addition, your GTA Online character will be reset.

Thank you R*, your support is overwelming. 

This ban has been issued with no reason, its just there, after I done a CEO Cargo sell mission.
Yeah ban legit players but keep the modders mod. Nice job R*. How to waste 100 hours and 30€ for this stupid game without an anti-cheat.

Also, thanks to my brother for his christmas gift. That made me happy. But now the money spent worthless."

												GTA ONLINE is banning everyone for doing nothing.  my friend was banned and so was a lot of people at the time. don't buy this game or play the Online stay safe becuase rockstar doesn't care about you. 

Update : if you comment something like they don't ban people for no reason. I will remove your comment and I will ask you to hook the discord overlay into your GTA use XSPLIT or delete one texture file. Go ahead they don't ban you if your not cheating right ;) just do it. 

I also made a video on the subject that can be seen here.

												""He sits on his ♥♥♥ all day, smoking dope and jerking off while he plays that ♥♥♥♥ing game. If that's our standard for goodness... then no wonder this country's screwed."" - Michael De Santa

STORY (No Spoilers)Grand Theft Auto V pits the player into the roles of the three main protagonists: Michael, a married man suffering from a midlife crisis, Franklin, a gangster trying to make a change for himself, and Trevor, who's just a Canadian psychopath. The trio get together and perform all sorts of daring heists and escapades.

The game is action-packed with chases, gang shootouts, and intense heists that get crazier as the game goes on.
When you're not robbing a convenience store or shooting rednecks, you can partake in all sorts of activities. You can walk your dog—Chop, go golfing, play tennis, and even get a lap dance at the strip club (Sorry Roman, there's no bowling)!

GTA ONLINE:
The GTA Online Protagonist can be created according to the taste of the player to customize (gender or appearance). The player will choose a gender, then choose the parents and grandparents of the character to affect his/her appearance. Then, the player chooses how much the character spends his/her daily life; this will create the initial stats for the character and slightly change the appearance.

After you have finished creating your character, you arrive in Los Santos with an open welcome by Lamar Davis (Especially if you're a female). He then has you do a street race with him (and other new players, if available), and shows you to Gerald, a drug runner who'll give you easy jobs to start you off in Los Santos. After you complete this tutorial, you'll join a free roam session with up to 32 other players (Who'll either become your friend or your enemy).

There are multiple game modes in Online, including:
Free Roam - Run around with up to 32 of your closest friends (or enemies), causing chaos and other nonsense. You can also compete in mini-games, such as target practice, arm wrestling, golf, and tennis. If you don't like to be killed constantly by other players in Free Roam, you can play in Solo Mode, but you'll be unable to play game modes that require more than one player.
Missions - These are given out by characters in GTAV (Lamar, Gerald, Martin, etc.), and are co-op jobs with up to 4 players.
Survival - Try to survive up to ten waves of enemies with 3 other players.
PVP - There are multiple subsets of this, including: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch (Free for all), Vehicle Deathmatch, Team Elimination (You only have one life.), Capture (A twist to Capture the Flag), Objective-based missions (Complete a objective, while the enemy team tries to do the same), races, and parachuting.
Heists - These are my personal favourite. With up to three of your friends (friends are highly recommended, unless you want to fail the heist repeatedly), you can perform challenging and rewarding missions to obtain lots of cash and exclusive heist vehicles. Unlike basic jobs, these heists involve multiple sub-jobs within them called Heist Setups that must be completed prior to the Heist Finale. As the heist leader, you can set what crew member does what job and their pay for doing that job. Teamwork is essential because the entire team shares one extra life (or none at all if the dificulty is above normal), and if that life is expended, the current mission fails and you'll have to restart it.
There are multiple glitches in GTA Online, some are funny and weird, the others are exploits and game-breaking. So far I haven't seen any hackers, but I wouldn't doubt their existence.

Final VerdictIn retrospect, I give Grand Theft Auto V a 9/10
+ Amazing story
+ Excellent gameplay
+ Fun with friends, and fun without them!
+ Great graphics
+ GTA Editor
+ Heists are fun and replayable for more cash
- Glitches

												This game costs $59.99. The servers are always fluctuating in up/down status. This game costs $59.99. Programs like Discord or any other voice chat will get you banned. This game costs $59.99. Even on a solid state drive it takes over three minutes to load into the online functions. This game costs $59.99. Rockstar Support is almost completely automated, and the only time you get a human representative they read off of a script. This game costs $59.99. The game has been out for three years and still has a massive memory leak. This game costs $59.99. Everything is locked behind a paywall in the same fashion as mobile games. This game costs $59.99. This game has extreme netcode issues and rubberbanding, leaving players online to have experiences only comparable to high latency DAYZ servers. This game costs $59.99.

But wait, this game doesn't cost $59.99. This year alone Rockstar made over $700,000,000.00 from microtransactions via Shark Cards, meaning that ALL in-game multiplayer items are purchasable through real money. If you go broke in GTA V Online you will NEVER recover unless you spend real money. At that point you will legitimately never be able to buy in-game items again with the pathetic missions and heists that were No Man's Sky'd at release. 

To be able to have every item in GTA V Online you have to spend over $500.00. 

This game costs $500.00.

The only ""Theft"" here is on Rockstar's end."

												Randomly received temporary ban online while afk. 14 days later after having all requests for information or assistance ignored I come back to my account with all my assets deleted as well. 12 years and never once cheated on a game, and the admins on this game randomly ban me for being afk and delete all my work.

Highly do not recommend, Rockstar wouldn't even respond with any type of explanation. I wish I could refund or even just give this game away because I'm so upset about their customer support. 

I will never purchase any of their products again, nor play any of their games online. There is no excuse for an ''accidental'' ban and deletion of assets, and then they treat the customer as if they are a cheating child with no explanation or even without providing any evidence.

												Things I Have Never Done in GTA Online:
- Used Hacks in Any Form
- Modded the Game (Single or Multiplayer)
- Been Given Hacked Money
- Asked for Hacked Money
- Glitched or Used Exploits 
- Cheated or Abused the Game
- Had any Software Installed that has been known to Interfere with Cheat Detection

Things I Have Done: 
- Paid for GTAV on two platforms
- Spent over 350hours playing GTAOnline across two platforms
- Rarely spent any time in Public GTAOnline Sessions
- Bought all Previous Rockstar Games and Loved them

So in early December 2016 I was grinding hard in GTAOnline during a slow week. I had decided to set myself goal of earning enough money through CEO Jobs and Biker Work to buy a Super Yacht. After a few days of grinding I logged on and found I had been banned. I checked my email and found an agressively vague non-spesific email telling me I had violated Rockstars EULA and I had been banned from GTAOnline for one month.

At first I was fairly okay with this, it was one month, and sometimes these things happen. Then I found out that I had my character stats, profile, money and assets wiped out. So I left a ticket on Rockstar social club querying this and attemping to appeal the ban and got back a generic reply that I had violated the EULA and the ban is final. 

I have spent the last month sending in tickets, asking different questions trying to at the very least pinpoint what my violation of the terms of service was. I have yet to recieve anything except identical replies, all giving me the exact same vague information that I had violated the EULA and had been banned and that all bans were final. I tried calling up Rockstar technical support (which I only found the phone number for my country on Reddit - thanks to who ever posted that), and the person on the phone read me the EXACT same reply I got by email and then proceeded to hang up. 

At the very least Rockstar has some horrible customer service. At worst, they are deliberately obstructing and willfully ignoring the compaints of paying customers. No automated ban system is flawless, and prior to this I would have agreed that people claiming false bans are just whining cheaters. But now I believe that there is at least a minority of banned players who have been banned for no valid reason, have had hours upon hours of gameplay wiped and have no recourse to appeal the bans. There are victory stories from before Rockstar updated their ban policy mid-2016 when people had been able to appeal the bans due to false-positives, and this at least shows that the automated ban system is flawed. 

Let me be clear: I couldn't even find out what I did to earn the ban, let alone be given the chance to refute it. 

---
So: if you want this game for singleplayer, go for it. It's good. Story isn't as tight as GTAIV but the gameplay has improved greatly. But if you want to buy GTAV for Online only, think twice; because you may end up having hundreds of invested hours wiped out for no apparent reason, and have no way to even appeal or find out why."

												Edit: These problems seem to be ocurring less by now, but I'm leaving this review up as a warning to the scummy business practices of Rockstar.
-----------------
People are being banned for no reason and Rockstar agrees with them, yet they are still refusing to reverse the bans or do anything to help. Using Discord, Fraps, Any third party Framerate counter or any program that adds an overlay to your games will result in you getting banned, and support will not reverse it. Heck, if you buy shark cards and they don't work they won't even refund you for that!
Do not support awful business practices like this. Their anti cheat is terrible and their support just wants your money.











EDIT: A lot of people seem to be taking this as ""Waaaah! I got banned!"", so let me clear things up. I have not been banned, I uninstalled the game myself as the hard drive space it took was massive and I didn't play it much. For those who don't believe the large amount of people who have been falsely banned, here are a few more reasons why you shouldn't support R*.

There is a limitless amount of bugs for Online. Ranging from everyone in your session suddenly leaving the game at once, you being booted for no reason, connections timing out randomly, all of these are punctuated with the worst error screen I have ever seen. Instead of presenting you with a simple ""You have timed out"", the game instead spends much time loading up Single player, puts you into the world, and *then* gives you an error message, with an option to rejoin. Which how ludicrously long the load times in this game are, that's a good 2-5 minutes waiting for an error to appear just so you can start waiting again to get back into the game. It is incredibly easy to fix, but rockstar still haven't because they do not care.

There is no server browser. This means that with the endless adversary modes they add, all are dead within a week. The only options you have when in an adversary mode is to invite people of a similar level (which almost never works) and to invite everyone who was in your previous free roam session. If you are playing free roam, would you want to suddenly be pulled into a small mode which likely won't have many players? I thought as much. Thus the modes die off extremely quickly.

And finally, the Anticheat is still terrible. You can have people flying around the map, spawning props locking you in place, dropping money bags on everyone (Which in an amusing way, can result in *them* getting banned) and just generally causing havoc. Every ""attempt"" Rockstar has made has resulted in false positives, and an extremely intolerant system towards modders. You remember how much Rockstar said they ""loved"" the PC Audience and their modders? That's amusing considering they're filling the game with dummy code to confuse them, and you will be instabanned if you go anywhere near Online with the slightest hint of a modification to your game files.

In all, do not support a developer who does not care about their audience. They release modes (The recent Further adventures in Finance and Felony update is a great case for this) that require either for you to grind an unreasonable amount of money, or buy shark cards to make it all easier. Not to mention the adversary modes they throw out are easy to make and take little to no effort, as again, they'll be dead within a few weeks.

You will be better off supporting another company. Move on."

												I love this game to death but there is one thing I can't ignore.
The anti-cheat system.
So if you still want to get this game I'll leave a few tips for you to avoid getting banned.

-See a cheater, get out of the lobby
-Don't use mods even for single player
-Don't use third party overlays

If I find anymore ways I'll update, anyways I hope this helps anyone looking into the game.

Edit: These are just precuactions even doing these you might not avoid the bans."

												Finally after numerous delays and waiting forever it has arrived...
Rockstar did a really good job on this.  The delays seem to have paid off.  The game runs completely maxed out (ultra settings @ 1920x1080) on my laptop (GTX 780m 4GB SLI) and I get 40-60 FPS.  Oh and the game is really fun too, a huge improvement from GTA IV.  I don't think I need to talk much about the game because everyone on earth knows it's great already.  If you didn't know it's great then I'll tell you right now - it's great.  A must buy if you haven't played it.
+ Huge improvement over Grand Theft Auto IV
+ Runs smooothly on mid range PCs
+ First person mode is amazing
+ Entertaining characters and story
+ No glitches at all yet
= Co-op in the story mode would have been cool
- First person mode doesn't work good for most missions9/10

***FINAL EDIT ???*** Permanently banned today. I am very surprised and never saw this coming /sarcasm. Why would I be complaining for months about my bans, but continue to cheat and get banned? 1002 hours played over the years, not a single cheating infraction until 2 months ago, when their anti-cheat was updated. Bans within weeks of each other since then. Hmmm, seem legit.

***EDIT #200: I contacted Rockstar support online 3 time. Each time they were unable to verify my claim. I called their support (1800-601-237 for Australia) and the guy I spoke to wasn't able to verify my claim. That's 4 people who couldn't verify my claim. I asked to speak to the supervisor, who finally COULD VERIFY MY CLAIM. That's right, you actually have to look into the problem to verify it. These people are incompetent duds. But at least I got my $4.8 million back.***

***EDIT: My third ban finished, but they took all my legitimate money. $4,800,000 that I farmed for hours, doing Pac Standard, stolen from me. For reference, to buy $3,500,000 from Rockstar it costs $50. Rockstar have stolen $70 worth of in-game currency from me. They shut down support tickets. They say they're auditing my account, but they never get back to me. If you know of anyone or any place I can contact to help me out, please let me know.***

I've left the old review below, but I'm writing a more in-depth one since I've been through a lot of ♥♥♥♥.

About a week before the Finance and Felony update, I started up GTA Online to kill some time. Played around for about an hour, then went out. About 2 hours later I got an email saying I was banned.

I played as I normally would, never used mods in single player or online etc. etc. Created many support tickets, which were all instantly closed. TOP TIP: If you want to send them a ticket regarding a ban, file it under 'bug report'. This guarantees a human will look at it, at the very least. Filing it under anything to do with a ban will auto-solve it and get you an automated message telling you to ♥♥♥♥ off. Good support.

So 10 days pass, no reply. My ban was over exactly the day Finance and Felony came out, so I played it for a bit. They'd taken all my money, ~$15,000,000. Some was given to me by a modder, most notably I got a very large sum by beating a random person in a point-to-point race (~$10,000,000 instantly for winning). My money was reset to $20,000.

TOP TIP #2: You don't get banned for receiving or using modded money. Only by being a cheater. Google it if you don't believe me, there's a post by Rockstar Games on their support forums.

About 2 hours later, I was banned again. 1 month this time.

At this point, I'd spoken to a lot of other people with the same issue, but no word on whether Rockstar was even aware of it.

About a week into the 1 month ban, I heard people were getting unbanned. Started up the game, and I was unbanned too. I have screenshots in my library that show the initial ban, the 1 month ban, and then the unban message. Stating my RP had been returned to a previous state for whatever reason.

So I played normally, everything seemed fine.

That is, until about a week ago. There was another ban-wave. Wouldn't you know it, I was banned again. 1 month again. There is a screenshot of that too, which proves my other ban was overturned (Rockstar NEVER overturn bans, unless they ban you by mistake). I received my second 1 month ban before the first one was even scheduled to end.

I am still banned now, and have been banned for almost 1 month all up, completely illegitimately. ♥♥♥♥'s ♥♥♥♥ed, Rockstar doesn't care and I get a bunch of nerds telling me I deserved it.

It's interesting to note that Rockstar have not contacted me at all through-out this entire mess. Not even when I was unbanned, to let me know they'd fixed their ♥♥♥♥ up. Much less to apologies.

Also interesting to note that a lot of people blamed VoIP programs and a bunch of those nerd gamer overlay programs for getting them banned. I don't use any of that ♥♥♥♥, and it still happened to me. All just speculation.

10/10 game.

♥♥♥♥♥♥ old review bellow.
__________________________________________________________

EDIT #2: BANNED AGAIN. THANK YOU ROCKSTAR. THANK YOU.

EDIT #1: UNBANNED NOW. THEY DUN ♥♥♥♥ED UP. THEY TOOK ALL MY MONEY THO

At least 1 hacker in every single online session, and they choose to ban ME for 10 days instead. Try to contact Rockstar, and they instantly close your ticket with an automated message telling me cheats have been detected, but no proof of course. So I do some reasearch, seems like a lot of people were hit with a false-positive and Rockstar doesn't care."

(UK Customer) I paid £39.99 on release, current standalone price is £51.98 but a -25% discount makes it £38.98. This kind of business practice is actually against ASA regulations, raising the price of a game and then putting it on sale to make it look like it's actually reduced is not considered a fair marketing strategy in the UK.

With regards to the bundle with ""Great White Shark Cash Card"" at the same price of £38.98, it's a move that isn't really on the side of the consumer or in the spirit of past steam sales. It has only been out for 2 months on PC so I don't think anyone was hoping for a big discount but putting it in a bundle and slapping a -25% discount on it really means the consumer isn't saving at all. They're getting some free in-game money which might be nice for some people but I think if most wanted the game + In-game money bundle they'd have prepurchased it when the in-game money was also free. 

I hope people don't just see the -25% discount and think they're getting a great deal by saving 25%, beacuse they're really not. You're either getting some free in-game money or - even worse - nothing at all with the standalone discount. GTA V is a great game but if you were looking to save on it you won't be in this current steam sale.

Rockstar, please treat your customers with more respect."

												Grand Theft Auto V is a game set within the fictional state of San Andreas which is based on Southern California and its developers has done a great job of replicating real world locations. The game is very well optimized as well compared to the previous title, Grand Theft Auto IV which was such a disastrous game to run.

The gameplay is quite fast-paced, gunplay feels fun and satisfying. Driving in this game stroke a minor controversy as it felt a bit too 'casual' compared to the previous major installment, GTA 4. The graphics are phenomenal for an open world game and the level of detail in the world is incredible and the city feels very lively with a variety of NPC pedestrians scattered across the map . 

The story is fun and well written. There are three led protagonists throughout single player and players can switch between them. Each of every mission in the game's story mode is unique so they don't feel very repetitive. When the story is over there really isn't much left to do however, there are a number of activities in which you can engage in single player such as racing, hanging out with your friends, hunting down the wild life and playing sports but they're not as fun as they ought to be. 

GTA Online is probably the main reason why people get this game but in my opinion it barely has any redeeming qualities and I don't know why people are buying the game just for this. Firstly, the concept of playing around in a huge open world with friends just simply sounds fun and it actually is, surprisingly. There are a couple of things you can play in Online mode, missions, heists, races and adversary mode which has a variety of game modes. But that's pretty much about it for the fun aspects of Online, now for the cons. Online is very, very grindy and is just pretty repetitive overall. Let's just say that you have a wish to buy a vehicle that costs around 2 million dollars (just a reference) which is pretty easy to get in single player, but it's different Online. You will have to repeatedly do the same missions / heists / works over and over until you get enough money and by the time you get the vehicle you will feel a sense of satisfaction for a short while until you find another vehicle you want to get. Sure, there are micro transactions called shark cards which add money into your character but for the price it's not worth it at all. Another negative of the Online mode is hackers, they ruin the fun of the game and makes it worse especially when the game itself isn't much fun.

To sum it up, I think the game is pretty good, especially the single player campaign but I do not think that it is worth spending $60 USD just for it and the multiplayer is trash in my opinion but do buy this on a sale if you have money to spare."

												I recommend the game. It's a solid port. However, Rockstar is absolutely NOT a trustworthy company for PC gamers.

So, in addition to stringing along the PC community for years since GTA V's announcement, the countless absurd delays, and now the Summer Sale price gouging?

Everyone's missing that all those bundles they're packaging with GTA V? They're non-refundable because they go straight to Rockstar's service.

It took them days to decide to abuse and circumvent Valve's refund service. Days.

You may have finally made a solid PC port, Rockstar, but you are absolutely f*cking with things any person or company with a shred of morality would not be f*cking with."

												I am disappointed on where this game has gone, despite how long I've used to play this game nearly everyday.

Hackers are in just about every lobby and Rockstar does the worst job to take care of this issue. Often, innocent players are being banned, blown up, teleported, or trapped (to name a few things) for absolutely no other reason besides being in the lobby, knowingly or unknowingly, with a hacker. I've waited a couple months now to wait for Rockstar to improve their system or completely resolve this, but everytime I try to log onto GTA V to check, I'm told that I can't connect to the servers (Or something similar), even after I've confirmed on Rockstar's site that their servers were infact running.

Rockstar's support system will not help you either, they simply just want you to buy their game and then ignore the fact that you were falsely banned or can't even play.. None of my support tickets have been responded to, ever, and I'm obviously not the only one either as seen all over the support section of their site. I strongly suggest that you do not support their game, it seems as if they just want your money."

												Let me start at the beginning in order to accurately describe this atrocity that has happened to me a few months ago. Just now decided to write a review after seeing the same thing has happened to so many others. 

I bought GTAV on September 17th, 2013. I waited in the pre-order line at gamestop because I was so damn hyped for this game. I was only intending to play it on console until the PC version came out. At this point I had no clue that there was going to be character swaps from console to PC. I obtain level 72 on console. Loving the game, couldn't be happier (except if the radio stations were better).

PC version release date is announced sometime in January 2015. I immediately pre-order it in order to get the bonus money that was available as a pre-order incentive. Upon release I transfer my character from console to PC and recieve my pre-order money. I was so thrilled to finally be playing this great game on PC. In the last year I put in 390 hours online in this game and achieved level 136 if I recall correctly. Countless hours of heist grinding, job grinding, lots of shark cards bought. Sitting at something like 11million dollars. 2 houses, 2 garages. Everything I could ever want in the game. I had things that weren't even obtainable anymore. I was thrilled with where the game was going. Then.... I get bored; So I quit playing for 2 months.

A friend asks me, ""Hey come play GTA with me let's wreck some kids"". Sure why not. I get on for about an hour and we do just that, wreck some kids. I log off for the night and log in the next day to a 10 day ban. I was beyond baffled. How could I be banned when I didn't do anything? Surely rockstar support can help me. So I call in an attempt to figure out what is going on. I get fed a rehearsed line about bans being the result of online modding etc etc. I ask for a supervisor, the supervisor says the same thing. I ask for his supervisor. He says there is no one above him available and I was unable to appeal my ban. His reasons are as follows.
""Just accept the 10 day ban."" 
""If you weren't really doing anything then in 10 days you can play again and nothing will be lost, just take a break"". He neglects to tell me that the system was going to take all of my money and I would have to start over. Grinding countless heists/jobs or buy a large sum shark card (which is ultimately what they wanted me to do).

I come back around 12 days later and play for a few hours. Nothing out of the ordinary happens. I then got off for the night. The following day I got back on and was banned again. This time for 30 days. I think to myself ""No &*%#ing way, this isn't possible"". I call AGAIN and get the same rehearsed line AGAIN from both the first and second level of support (always ask for a supervisor). Except this time something was different. This time I was being allowed to appeal my ban. I thought for sure I would be exonerated of these allegations. Nope. I was told that I must have been hacking if their skynet system banned me. That there is nothing they can do and that ""evidence of illicit activity"" was found on my account. So I ask them to check again and they do. Same result. 

At this point I start thinking ahead. ""What happens when I get back from this 30 day ban?"". ""I'm just going to be banned again for the same false reason?""
They reply, ""that shouldn't happen sir"". I reply, ""Shoulda coulda woulda. It's happened twice now so what makes next time any different. No variables have changed. If I record all of my gameplay from now on will that protect me? If I am indeed banned upon return to your game can I use the footage as proof of my innocence?""
""Yes"", I was told. Not maybe, not ""we're not sure"". I was told ""Yes, that will suffice"".
So I did just that. I recorded all of my gameplay. Unfortunately ""all"" only ended up being roughly 2 hours the night I was unbanned after the 30 day ban because I was immediately banned permanently after logging off for that night.

This is starting to get a little longer than I expected so I'll cut it short. I tried to appeal the permament ban. I thought ""I have video that I didn't do anything, surely this time it will be different.... they will have to unban me"". NOPE.
I'll just end my review here and link my evidence. The videos of my gameplay and their final reply to me in my appeal where I linked them the videos.

 TL;DR: ROCKSTAR CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE AND IF YOU BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL BE BANNED BY SKYNET SIMPLY FOR BEING IN THE SAME LOBBY AS A SCRIPTER (WHICH WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN). 

Edit: According to various sources (denied by Rockstar when I called them today) I was banned for MSI Afterburner/RivaTuner. This would make sense to me now that I think about it. However my review remains unchanged because they are doing absolutely nothing to fix the issue. I was told that I am not allowed to appeal my permanent ban because their system is flawless and does not falsely ban people for any reason. The support supervisor (Kyle) even acknowledged that he had heard of the MSI/Riva complaint but that it was ""false"". So yeah I'm still in the same place I started. Still will never support another Rockstar game for as long as I live."

												So I don’t really write reviews, I’m too lazy or just don’t have the time in my life.

 But for this game I’m willing to bother, mainly because of the  ATROCITIES  that this game possesses. Single player is great sure, but online is such a bigger part of this game now, most people play it just for that mode. But I’m sure you’ve seen other reviews saying: “modders have ruined it!” and “online is no fun cos of hackors!”.

Well that’s because it’s true. All of it.

Allow me to put this as realistically as possible.

I have amassed a total of 420 hours on GTAV. Didn’t play the campaign, I had already done that when it first arrived on console. No, these hours are mainly online play. I’ve grinded mission after mission to earn the cash. I’ve spent hours buying, customizing and completing challenges. I now have a profile that has all the levelled unlocks, cars and guns you could ever want, making it a very hard earned profile.

HOWEVER, I have now lost most (if not all) of my desire to switch this game on, and I’m sure you have a pretty good idea of why that is. Nether the less, I shall give you an example of a typical session of online play if you were to enter the game today (which let’s face it, is the main reason why we play it).

Enter my first match. > begin attempt to have fun. > Player arrives on a bike and kills me to death. > very well, I shall retaliate by firing a rocket at his bike. > Rocket hits.  > But wait, the player didn’t die. > Then quickly learn from further attempts and other players that he is using God-mode > I then attempt to use the player menu to ‘vote to kick’ him, as others were attempting to do the same thing  > Turns out he has used a mod that removes his name from the player list, making it impossible to kick him out of the match. > I then call him out for using Mods (with restraint to call him many, many things) > At this point he proceeds to delete my car and spawn 100,000 things on my head, making my game crash to desktop (and probably anyone else who was near-by in game).

Now after lots and lots of match surfing, I can quite confidently state the following with applied calculation and experience: 

If you buy this game for the online side of play, roughly 1 in 3 of your free-roam sessions will be rife with situations similar to this ^.


So to give you an evaluation:

 If you are a normal player – 

Prepare to have unfair play, have your things deleted, and get crashed to desktop by modder’s whenever you challenge their actions, because Rockstar will never regulate and control this issue.

 If you are wanting to be a modder – 

You can enjoy being invincible, gank on players then delete everyone’s things, and if they call you out you can just crash everyone, because you are a big man and Rockstar will never regulate or control this issue. Then they’ll write negative reviews, losing the game its popularity to a point where it just becomes garbage. Then you’ll have it all to yourself, and your mission to alienate everyone from online play will be complete.


To quote another game (that I would recommend more tbh):

“Well done Stanley, everyone thinks you’re very powerful.”


P.S - The second biggest issue is the micro-transactions, and rockstar's ever vigilant attempt to take in-game money from you in order to force you into buying shark cards with real money. but that needs a whole review in itself to detail that issue (which i really dont have the time in my life for).
   

My only hope is that enough people will see this review and get it to the bench, so that maybe some people will decide not to ruin this game with bad modder/hacker behaviour.

 06/16 Edit: 

Rockstar did a ban wave and disabled the ability to use console (apparently), soo... yay?
Wonder if my moaning review had some sort of effect, anyway im going to leave this here just as a principle.

 02/17 Edit: 

Well here we are again. Rockstar have dropped the ball and now modder/hackers/whatever you wanna call them, have returned. Its worse than ever now. Back to the drawing board...."

												I used to love this game so much. I've played more than 200 hours across PC, PS4, and PS3. My review for this game used to be so positive as I loved how much there was to do. However, I now have to make my review negative for the following reasons.

I've had my current character for over two years. In those two years I reached level 100 and I have so much stuff like multiple properties, a yacht, a business, a biker gang, etc. Not once have I modded GTA Online, but that didn't stop them from banning me.

I recently logged on to find out that my account was suspended until next month, and that when my account became available again, I would have to start over. My first thought was that this is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I didn't hack, I worked my way for a long time to get my character to where it was now and I lose it all because Rockstar can't tell the difference between a modder and a regular user.

My second thought is that ""this is why people hack"". Rockstar makes everything in GTA Online super expensive. It's over $1mil for a damn tug boat, a really ugly tug boat. I can buy a nice super car for a quarter of that price, any car would be better that a slow ♥♥♥ tug boat. Everything is so expensive that you either have to grind forever (there are good methods of making money but they require you to spend a lot of money first), buy shark cards, or get a modder to give you money.

Honestly, this game has gone to absolute crap for me."

												If this game was split into two Steam hubs for the Single Player and the Multiplayer, the SP would have a 99% positive and the Multiplayer would look like No Man's Sky. It is an excellent single player game, but mimics a trash and cash-grabby freemium game for multiplayer. It seems like Rockstar only sees their players as wallets.

The lowest price this game has gone for is $30, so wait until then. When you do, just stick to single player. For a good open world multiplayer experience, head elsewhere. 

Cons first, pros second.

Cons

Rockstar intentionally designed their online ecosystem to be like a cash-grabby mobile game. You are able to own property, vehicles, etc. However, you have to earn currency by playing similar grindy missions/heists or competitions. This seems great in concept, but the numbers are intentionally designed to make you feel like it would be easier to just ""buy"" the in-game currency with real money. Also, if you come from the single player, you get much less cash in general, so you are getting less money than you are ""used to"", which contributes to the aforementioned psychological pressure. Yes, you can theoretically get it all with time spent in-game, but this is similar to the League of Legends IP model in which the time spent per money acquired is so low that you are constantly pressured to just spend the real money. This sort of constant pressure does not make for an enjoyable gaming experience.

There are superfluous accounts of Rockstar refusing to appeal any bans for online play. The ban-worthy offenses include but are not limited to: using any overlays, recording software, voice chat software such as Discord, etc etc. Oh, and make sure to hell that you don't EVER mod the single player, because that'll get you banned in multiplayer too! (maybe this is why Bethesda doesn't do multiplayer?)

Let's also not mention that some hackers can appear in your public games (because you can't do these grindy missions by yourself) and just spawn money over your head. You can go jump through a bunch of hoops to try to get rid of that ""hacked"" cash, but even the fact  that this is possible is ludicrous. 

How on earth are you supposed to prepare so much for all of these detrimental nuances? No one should have to be this scared and pensive to just play multiplayer normally, but it primarily exists as a cash grab to support the ""free"" DLC that Rockstar releases (which you need to acquire with in-game currency, of course). 

If you get banned, you will get ignored. Rockstar already made their money off of you, so who cares.

Rockstar also has a history of greed by refusing to put the game on sale during Steam sales. They instead will lump the game at the reduced price and throw the ""Shark cash"" in with the, so it is tough to find it below 60 bucks. You probably won't want to play multiplayer anyway. 


Pros

This is one of THE best single player games I've ever played. The over-world has an astounding amount of detail and nuance, the content is ample, the characters and story are interesting, and a lot of the mechanics are fun to use. The story is surprisingly deep and is on par with a gang/mafia style movie. One of the things that Rockstar has understood about GTA is that making the driving/traversing around the world fun makes everything else fall into place, and this game is the best in the series at it. Sometimes you just want to drive around and go sight-seeing, which is extremely fun. 

As a PC port, it exceeds expectations. This game is proof that it is always worth it to wait for a PC port (most recent example being Final Fantasy XV), as long as the developer makes sure to do it well. Uncapped framerate, resolutions, lots of options for optimization, etc. The rendering distance is great, and it's very easy to see most of the distinct features of a landscape at a long distance. 

One of my main complaints is that hitting a high vehicle speed can make the rendering suffer a bit, but it's not a big deal."

												The game itself is good, but Rockstar is using a pretty shoddy business practice. They're forcing you to buy the game AND Shark Cards, which are just in-game multiplayer money, while the game is on ""sale"".

This shouldn't be acceptable. It's basically an excuse for them to charge full price for their game while claiming it's on sale.

UPDATE: Look at how old this review is people, this was for the Summer Sale, during which it was impossible to buy the base game without purchasing the shark card bundle. So you could not get the base game on sale, you had to purchase it along with a shark card which made the game full price.

This also made it so you couldn't refund the game, due to the Shark Card being considered DLC."

So now we can't go into public sessions because we could get permas because of someone giving us money, and we cant go into a private session because then we can't do CEO or Biker missions...

												Don't buy this game until Rockstar gets off their asses and fixes the ridiculous amount of bugs they still haven't touched since launch.

The game takes 12 hours to download on a good machine and crashes ten or twenty minutes for no reason. The online mode is full of hackers who kill everyone repeatedly and will even try to get you banned from the game by spawning you money. I don't have access to half of the map because the game will crash if you drive too far north.

Don't bother reporting any bugs to Rockstar, they have some of the worst customer service I've ever seen. Take the crashes for example, I've seen hundreds of posts about this problem and Rockstar either ignores them or tells the poster to buy a better computer. This is obviously a huge problem that happens to many players and Rockstar hasn't even touched it yet.

Don't get me wrong, this is a good game when it works, a really good game. But the fact that Rockstar has ignored so many game breaking issues experienced by such a huge portion of their fanbase makes me think that Rockstar just doesn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥.

By the way, nice thing you pulled with the summer sale Rockstar!"

												GTA is a great game, I really enjoyed playing it on singleplayer and completing all missions.

However, if you intend to play it online (which I don't recommend) you should be really careful right now.

I just got banned but did not use any cheat or did anything wrong. 
I was in a heist and out of the blue I got the message:

""Your account was used in violation of our Terms of Service and/or EULA (...)
As a result, your account has been suspended from playing GTA Online on PC for 30 days. In addition to being suspended, all GTA Online characters, progress and inventory on PC will be reset.""

Later I found out people are getting banned because they were using some softwares like Discord, Teamspeak, Bandicam
Fraps, OBS, XSplit. 
I was using Discord to chat with friends and was recording the game with Xsplit, so I guess this was the reason for the ban.

Then I opened a ticket to explain the situation and thought that everything was going to be ok, but...
I got an automated message that said: ""All GTA Online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed."" and my ticket was closed.

Nice customer service. 10/10
Thanks Rockstar.

												Rockstar has a no questions asked ban policy and thousands of upset players who were permanently barred from online play thanks to false-positlives, discord overlays, MSI Afterburner, changing the FoV, the list goes on. Online play isn't even Grand Theft Auto anymore, it's economics simulator. You are forced to buy cars and store them in your garage instead of just stealing them, each new update brings inflation to in-game currency yet Sharkcards remain the same price. If you spend $100 on a Shark Card you can buy one vehicle and the required garage from the new update. Cannot recommend the game, Rock$tar is no longer interested in customer satisfaction, only customer churn. The latest ban-wave came literally two days before the game went on sale. Say no to predatory business practices."

												I can't recommend this right now because of the scummy business practices that Rockstar are currently employing. As you have probably read, it is impossible to get a real 'discount' on the game as they have decided to instead bunch it together with a shark card leaving the game with no real discount. Not only does mean that the game isn't really on a discount, it also means that you probably won't be able to refund it in case something goes wrong or if you change your mind because of the unrefundable micro transaction along with it. I preorded this game before it came out, but for players who do not currently own it and are considering it, I would probably wait until this is over. Hopefully Rockstar will see how angry the Steam community is about this and sort it out. Until then, I would suggest waiting. The game itself is enjoyable for the most however, but I can't suggest it until Rockstar sort this out."

												TLDR; It's not worth it. Not for the single Player, not for the Multiplayer. Don't give Rockstar money for this game. 

As other reveiws and countless articles have shown, Rockstar does not listen to the playerbase. The anti-Cheat just doesn't work.

 I've been permanently banned from all of GTA Online without ever going into a public server. All I've done is join a friends private, invite only session. This was the first time I logged into GTA online, I should add. 

So, I call up Rockstar support. I explain my issue. 

""It seems like our Anti Cheat engine flagged you on accident, since it has no reason why."" 

 ""Wonderful. When do you think I can play again?"" 

""Bans can't be appealed or removed.""

""You just said that I was falsely banned."" 

""Yes Sir."" 

""And... I'm going to still be banned. ""

""Yes Sir. If that is all, you can fill out a small questionaire about how we helped you today!"" 

Oh.. You bet I filled that puppy out. Again. Don't buy this game. The single player is good, but not worth the issues you WILL have with rockstar."

												First of all...
ROCKSTAR IS NOT BANNING FOR SINGLE PLAYER MODS. They've now stated this outright. I mean seriously, when did we start believing people who were banned, just because they say they're innocent? 90% of these new negative reviews are unfounded and outright lies. Not only that, but they have no changed the EULA, either. If you have a DLL injector installed in your game directory, it DOESN'T MAGICALLY STOP WORKING WHEN YOU GO ONLINE. Just because you don't use it, it's STILL there. YOUR OWN FAULT.

Like seriously, when did people get dumb enough to think an anti cheat wouldn't pick up DLL INJECTORS? DLL INJECTORS ARE THE MOST COMMON WAY HACKS EXIST. *headdesks* There are two groups of people - actual cheaters, who got banned from online for cheating using the scripthook and trainer (dll injection), and then there's people who only used it in single player but left it installed when they went online. Newsflash - it's still there, it's still injected into the games memory.

In any case, the game is great. There's a few speed bumps and quirks here and there that need to be worked out, as with any game so soon after launch, but overall it performs great, online is fun, and you can mod single player. Not really a lot more you can ask for, amirite?

9/10, because I don't believe in perfect scores.

P.S. Stop being idiots.

Edit: In light of a few ignorant jackasses, here's the proof:
http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire
“I’m having soo much fun with GTAV on the PC but I just have one question about it, how come you are not allowing mods for it?” - @ClarkMatthew63
“Will I get banned from GTA Online for using a FoV Mod or Oculus Rift mod?” - @Mattophobia



We have always appreciated the creative efforts of the PC modding community and we still fondly remember the awesome zombie invasion mod and original GTA map mod for GTAIV PC among many other classics. To be clear, the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for GTAIV.  Recent updates to GTAV PC had an unintended effect of making unplayable certain single player modifications. This was not intentional, no one has been banned for using single player modifications, and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player PC mods. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing. It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized, they may be broken by technical updates, cause instability, or affect your game in other unforeseen ways.

But by all means - let's just believe the banned people because they said ""they didn't do it"". It's not like cheaters to lie about it or anything."

												Only time I've reviewed a game and it's more of a warning.

Bought the game, downloaded, played for a couple hours with an IRL friend, came home from work the next day and was banned. I was given no reason why, just an email linking to the EULA & ToS. Immediately tried contacting Rockstar Support and received a generic computer generated message, once again, linking me to the EULA & ToS and now saying they don't overturn bans. 

I'll rate the game 7/10 from the short time I played, the customer support a 0/10.


[EDIT] Turns out Rockstar's hack prevention program considers recording software to be malicious. Rockstar bans follow a three strike program (10 days, 30 days, permanent). 
I'll change my review once Rockstar support becomes competent."

												Used underhanded marketing to sell you things you didn't want to make it look like a sale. Should have never went on sale, or pretended to. I don't think the game costs 80$.

EDIT: Let me clear up some information that people seem to be misinformed about. This was posted when R* was doing their shady steam sale promotion. At the beginning you couldn't buy GTA V alone, at it's regular price of $59.99. You could buy it at the same price but with it's in game money card. Which was the only way to buy it, unless you wanted GTA San Andreas or Max Payne. So if someone posts in the comments about me being wrong about it being $80 then they should go do some Googling about what happened. If they hadn't put it on sale GTA V could only be bought at $84.99, so it was a fake sale."

												WARNING, DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ONLINE.

The game itself is well made. The support, well....there is no support. Unless you have a question where the answer can also be found on Google (they are happy to explain you things that you can find yourself as well), you will get an automated reply. For what I've seen, a lot of new people (including my friend) are getting banned without a reason from GTA 5 online. The ban period is for one month. Since there was nothing he did wrong, there is a big chance that when he logs in after that month, he will be perma banned.  When you address this issue to R*, all they do is give you the same reply over and over again and redirect you to their license and agreement. I would NOT recommend to buy this game, since you can get banned without a reason. R*'s ego about their automated ban system is so huge, starting a discussion with them about it is just a waste of your own time.

For all the people that are sitting, ready to reply: ""your friend is a cheater, he got what was coming to him"", just forget it.
I would not waste my time writing this review if I knew he hacked/cheated or whatever.

Please note that this review is regarding the support R* doensn't offer and GTA 5 online. Once you've sent them your money, don't count on any help. Bans can't be appealed, even though you are innocent.

For the people who do risk their money, I hope this won't happen to you.

Update 2-12-16: one month later, just as predicted my friend was banned again (permaban). He even asked R* to check his files before he logged in with a clean install. They refused and said to contact them again when he would be banned. We all know where this is going. Will update when something comes out of it, if not...we gave up on this game."

At first I was sceptic about false ban issue but then I got banned too and I have no idea why (supposedly for using Discord?!). Rockstar support refused to remove a ban or to give a reason for a ban.

												Finally after numerous delays and waiting forever it has arrived...
Rockstar did a really good job on this.  The delays seem to have paid off.  The game runs completely maxed out (ultra settings @ 1920x1080) on my laptop (GTX 780m 4GB SLI) and I get 40-60 FPS.  Oh and the game is really fun too, a huge improvement from GTA IV.  I don't think I need to talk much about the game because everyone on earth knows it's great already.  If you didn't know it's great then I'll tell you right now - it's great.  A must buy if you haven't played it.
+ Huge improvement over Grand Theft Auto IV
+ Runs smooothly on mid range PCs
+ First person mode is amazing
+ Entertaining characters and story
+ No glitches at all yet
= Co-op in the story mode would have been cool
- First person mode doesn't work good for most missions9/10

PS: Make sure you download the latest drivers for your graphics card(s).  Both Nvidia and AMD released GTA V drivers.  Links are below.

												The single player game is rather good, but the online game is just unplayable.

1. Countless bugs. When you do a heist there is about a 50% chance that you cannot finish it because of a bug. I am not even kidding. That means if you spend 2 hours on a heist, you are only actually playing the real game for 1 hour, as most of these bugs require a restart of the game.

2. Crashes. Random crashes occur all the time. Not only that, but some crashes are so terrible that it requires you to reinstall the game. One friend of mine has reinstalled the game more than 10 times now, I am yet again not kidding. More than 10 times he needed to download the entire game again, which is about 60gb each time.

3. Glitches. The only thing in the online game that is important is money. You can buy money from the store of the game, but that is never needed. There are multiple glitches and hacks which can make you a millionaire from doing nothing. That is destroying the gameplay a lot, and the programming level of this game to make these hacks possible is just terribly low (I am a programmer myself, and I am shocked that Rockstar Games managed to do this).

4. Online in a random game is just terrible gameplay. If you are in a car (which you most likely are), people will just one hit you with an RPG or a Homing Launcher. These players then have to pay a fine for your car if it was insured, which it most likely is. That means that they have to pay for the missile shot ($1500) and then the car (~$6000), but they do not care and think that they have ""won"" the battle, even if they payed for it.
This either means that people are just not smart enough in this game to understand that what they do actually makes them lose a lot of money, or that those players are using the glitches to have unlimited money, and can therefore just waste money to win in PvP. That means that money is much greater than skill in this game.

5. Heists. Apart from all the bugs, finding people to go to a heist with is just horrible. Most people can't even speak or type in english. This makes it impossible to finish a heist with random people. You have to use external websites to find a heist team, and even then its hard to find people that can actually finish a heist (about 5% chance to win a heist each try, hours and hours doing the same thing over and over).
Even if you finish all heists in a row, or without dying at all, there are bugs that removes the additional money given for achievements. This means that you can spend around 10 hours doing an achievement, and then when you should get $10 000 000 for it, you just get nothing.

I always wanted to work at Rockstar Games, but now I feel that I have nothing to learn from them. How can they fail so miserably making a game that works with that much money?"

												Bought this game to celebrate getting university finished for the year.  I did quite well with marks, so I figured it was well worth trying out a game to join some of my mates in the online mode.

$60 down the drain.
Took 12h to download this monster, and after *wait for it* 4 hours of playing, two of which being in GTA Online, I get banned.
I check emails and apparently I violated Terms of Use/EULA, without any specification as to what rules I broke.
Sent a request, regarding Ban Appeals to customer service only to get an automated response with copy-paste ""bans are final and cannot be appealed""

So, I log in, create a character, pinch an NPC's car, do some missions, buy some clobber (cheap t-shirt, pants, and shoes), I rob a convenience store as just after I vault a fence to escape the cops, I get hit with the banhammer.

And because I spent more than 2 hours (read: 4.2 hours) in-game, I am also ineligible for steam refund.

Whatever the single player is, I bought the game to play online with my mates.
Appalling customer service (i.e. unacceptable lack of customer service) and a solid middle finger.

												I wish I could recommend this game. If you haven't played the story yet, it's good. I would pay $30 for the story. It isn't as good as 4, as the characters aren't as interesting, but the world presented is significantly more alive and fun to explore.

However I assume most have played the story by now, and if you haven't I assume  you're not interested. And it's Grand Theft Auto: Online that I do not recommend.

Beyond the 55 or so hours we got out of the singleplayer my playtime has, for the most part, been in secluded servers with my wife and friends, as we cannot stand the public in the this game - and if you have a group like that, 5-10 people to roam the map with without having to worry about the insecure manchildren that plague this game - it can be incredibly fun. However, that is not enough to recommend it. At this point I play because I already own it; I would not purchase this again. It only gets used because my wife plays with a friend.

That is because this game has the worst community of toxic players you will ever encounter. It isn't really moderated anymore, so you can expect people to act as they please with next to no apparent overwatch. And the anticheat? Its an absolute joke. I have friends who have received bans for ""hacks"" that I know they didn't use (I have known and been gaming together with several of them for 20+ years, they're above reproach) and yet the real hackers aren't banned or in most cases even kicked from the lobby. Use an overlay though, and you'll get banned so fast your head will spin - yes, that is right, Rockstar won't reverse a ban if a software overlay like a chat client pulls a false positive for hooking into the game. I can't tell you if it's true but there are more claims than I personally dismiss. 

After that ban call R*, I hear they even acknowledge false bans now without doing anything about it. What a great company. That is sarcasm... For those who may not know, R* customer support is legendary for how terrible it is. And they don't need to change their act. They are rolling in money.

And the worst thing of all? I suspect R* is directly lying to customers saying they aren't releasing Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC in the hopes that you'll run out and buy it on console and then later when they release it on PC you'll buy it again. Just like they double- and triple-dipped with the staggered releases of GTA5. R* has gotten too greedy; like any developer who gets this large you should generally avoid their products until they return to a more customer-oriented model for business. People need to remember that companies will only do what customers let them. Your purchasing power counts."

												  Grand Theft Auto V  
Well, I played GTA V before on PS3 and I loved every moment of it,
I played it allot on PS3, about 75 hours on story mode and 80 hours on multiplayer.
It's not much but as I said, I liked it a lot.

So... the moment we have been waiting for!
Grand Theft Auto V on PC!

I bought it again for PC 
because I want get the best experience that this game can give
and play with my best friends that have only PC.

I have GTX 780 Ti and it runs well on it, decent fps.

Story mode is great
and characters are even better (like in every R games).
In this game, we will have 3 main character

[A bit of spoilers]
 Michael De Santa A retired bank robber, who,
after making a deal with the FIB,
moves alongside his family to Los Santos,
where they live in a nice mansion. 
 
 Franklin Clinton A young man who dreams of becoming big-time in Los Santos,
in a world where the glory days of street gangs has long passed. 
He works as a repo man for a car dealership,
but his ambition makes him tired of the job.

 Trevor Phillips Is a mentally unstable guy and bank robber.
A former military pilot, he based himself in Sandy Shores,
where he founded Trevor Philips Enterprises,
which mainly deals with weapons and drugs. (He's my favourite character).


 Grand Theft Auto Online Multiplayer with a lot of stuff to do (if it works).

 Game Modes 

	- Free Mode - my favourite thing to do in this game!
	- Deathmatch
	- Race (including standard, GTA and Rally modes)
	- Capture
	- Survival
	- Hold
	- Contend
	- Raid
	- Parachuting

You can have fun killing civilians 
or just chill and ride your car around beautiful places (what I like to do).

Heists are additional GTA Online missions 
that you can complete with your friends or with random people.
It's really cool and a lot of fun,
you will probably enjoy it!

So the conclusion is
that you must have this if you're a PC gamer,
as this game has almost everything (killing to racing).


The verdict is a Must have game
that you will enjoy playing alone or with friends.
As I said thousands of times,
it is fun and epic!

 Enjoy and have fun!

												raise the price right before the summer sale so it can go for ""sale"" at the same price as before. Way to be cheap R*

To help the simple people who don't get it understand. The problem is this is how they treat their customers, you pay full price for a two year old game and are met with rampant cheaters, overpriced content, and credit card unlocks. Essentially you pay 60 dollars for a game that is run like other pay-to-win free games. Sorry for the ambiguity, I supposed expecting everyone to be able to put 2 and 2 together was a bit much to expect."

												I love this game, but what Rockstar did with the summer sale broke my heart. I have friends who waited for this sale, waited for this game to go on sale specifically.

And what do you know! Day one, 25% off! But wait...what's this?

No it's not 25% off. It's a filthy lie. A manipulative trick to get you to buy 20 dollars worth of in game money, meaning in the end you save about a dollar fifty.

Again, I love GTAV, but until they do something to fix this shady buisness behavior, do not buy this game. It is not worth it. You can be better Rockstar, I know you can, come on."

												Hi.

This is about my first serious review, and I'll try to advise you if it's worth it or not to buy the game, based on my personal   opinion.
As you probably know, GTA has two kind of game modes, Online and Story mode and I'll judge both.

PLEASE REMEMBER, this is my personal opinion and everything is based on what I feel about the game, and I'll undersand and respect yours aswell.

- Story Mode -

Catchy story-mode.
Somewhat fun and dynamic questline.
Some nostalgic feels.
Balanced prices and easy fun.
Huge map, but feels somewhat empty.

My opinion - 

 It's pretty standard, same grab this kill that, race this kind of missions, but is it good? 
 From my point of view, it can be fun, though it lacks the "" Gta San Andreas "" vibes, but hey, it's a new game.
 If you came for the ol'gangbanging drive-by feel, it will let you down, mostly it's big game moves, stealing banks and others.
 But, apart from that, and that you can't get all the 'online' perks and dlc stuff, it's a pretty fun single player.
 
- Online  -
Huge open world, tho some of it lacks content.
Huge grind to get money.
Almost everything overpriced.
♥♥♥♥♥♥ community ( Imagine COD's and Minecraft community togheter, yeah ).
Free DLC's but really expensive in-game content.
Hackers and modded accounts.
Bad servers with huge loading times and frequent lost connections.
Weak UI, somewhat challenging to get around.
Game-modes feel straight up pushed into the game "" just to add content "".
Races are fun!                                       ...kinda.

||| - I understand that my views towards the online mode are mostly money centered, but without cash, you can't get around really. You need money for bullets, money for cars, money for houses, money for almost everything, it's the Lifeblood of the game. - |||

 
So in my opinion :

 The online feels like a massive grind. You'll get around but it just feels like you'll never enjoy the game to it's fullest without money. 
 The community is just random, either they  wont ever bother to talk to you or straight up blow up everything you love and care about.
It really feels like a pay to win game.
 Did I mention the hackers and modded accounts that will make you feel poor?
New DLC out! Great! What new content will I try? Oh, I can't really afford any. 
Alright, I got really side-tracked there, sorry.
I used to love GTA, but it feels that they've went way to greedy on everything and basic things that could be done to fix the game or improve it are shunned upon by the creators and instead we are given ever more expensive content to either buy shark cards or grind for 4 hours straight to get ONE CAR. It's just not the kind of game I wouldn't buy, and yes, I regret buying it.
-----------------------------


Thank you for stopping by, I hope this helped you in anyway, take your time to read other reviews and don't stick with just one, remember this is my opinion and yours might differ from mine. 

Good luck and Cheers :)"

												Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action adventure game developed by Rockstar North. This game is the fifteenth in the series. The game was originally released on Xbox 360 and PS3 in mid-2013, and then got a remastered version on Xbox One and PS4 in late 2014, before finally being released on the PC in April 2015.  The game quite rightly is a record setter, selling over 11 million copies and grossing over $800 million on the release day, before breaking the $1 billion marker three days afterwards. 

GTA V continues in tradition with the type of game play on offer. You play in third person over the shoulder view of the characters. The game has three main protagonists, who each have their own story and plot to go with them – somehow all three of these characters’s path cross throughout the game and they soon become key to each other’s story.  The driving in the game has been improved over the previous versions of the game, cars feel even more realistic to drive and the game’s physics engine is almost perfect with figuring out how objects will react should you hit them (or they hit you!). The gun play in this game is significantly better than the previous versions also, I did have issues with aiming and general fight scenes before, but GTA V sets out the controls and feel of the gameplay perfectly allowing you to not run into any stumbling blocks in terms of the controls or mechanics.  I did find the flying missions to be quite annoying at times, since I was playing the game on mouse and keyboard, I found the controls to be a bit fumbly when manning a helicopter or plane, but the flying parts of the game are few and far between.  The main core of the game revolves around completing story missions for each of the three main characters; these can range from stealing cars for a billionaire’s collection, right the way to robbing banks. There is plenty of variety in the missions you can do, and you will find it very difficult to find a moment in this game where you are bored. 

The game has gorgeous graphics, no they aren’t photo realistic, but that’s because the game’s style isn’t aiming for that. The PC version of this game is most certainly the pinnacle of gaming; it just puts the console’s version to shame when you compare the two.  My rig which is a monster, couldn’t handle putting the game out at 60 fps at 4k resolutions, but was quite happy to run every setting at maximum on 1080p, and it just looks fantastic. Normally open world games try to reduce the graphics slightly just because how much is being loaded at any one time, but GTA V does none of that; each of the textures are all high res, animation is absolutely perfect, and the lighting effects are some of the best I have seen in any video game. 

As with all GTA games, you are going to get a blockbuster style story line, this is one of the best, if not THE best plot to any video game and one which I will remember. All three of the character’s story are so well written, and perfectly intertwining with each other.  The game does have a large amount of cut scenes at the beginning of each level, some people may find this to be annoying as they would rather be playing the story rather than watching it; but personally I found the cut scenes to be just as interesting to watch as it is to play the game. They fully immerse you into the world of Los Santos. Not only is there a captivating main story to the game, there are also plenty of side missions whilst they are all quite basic tasks for you to complete, they all have some sort of story behind them for each character, which are all well worth your time in completing. 

The sound effects and voice acting goes above and beyond here as well. Every single one of the characters is so perfectly voice acted that you sometimes forget that these aren’t real people in front of. The ambiance sounds of the city are all amazing too, there is never a moment where there is just silence, whether it is people in the street chatting to each other, or someone getting road rage, there is always something going on.  Not to mention the game has 162 songs on the radio station, so you will always find something you are in the mood for when you are traveling across the map. 

The game isn’t exactly hard, there are missions which you will probably have to do over again because of silly reasons, such as crashing your plane from not being able to land it (I have had to do one of the missions way too many times to remember because of this!!), but I don’t think I actually died in a gun fight or a heist of any kind, since most of the time you are with one of the other characters you always have some kind of backup should things turn nasty. 

Los Santos is one of the biggest game worlds to ever be made, it is bigger than GTA IV, GTA SA and Red Dead Redemption combined. Whilst a good portion of the map is mountain ranges and open fields of emptiness in the northern regions, the actual city is a bustling hive of entertainment and action. Round every corner there is something for you to do, whether it be a side missions that involves you getting your mother the drugs she needs, helping a young lady get her purse back after being robbed (or not?) or just earning an honest day’s work by towing cars that are parked illegally. The world is your oyster in Los Santos.

The main story with a good portion of side missions and extras in GTA V took me just about forty six hours to complete. Whilst the main story is complete, I still have plenty of heists, extra missions, stunts, races…so much more to finish! The single player alone in this game can probably hit the heights of eighty hours if you want to complete everything, and it is something I am going to be aiming to do over the course of the next few months. Never have I played a game that has made me want to do that more! Having only played the game through once, I cannot be 100% sure on this, but I feel there is a slight portion of the game which can change depending on what actions you take towards the latter stages of the story so if you do want to replay the game again, there is going to be a bit of a different story at the end of it depending on what you choose. 

Technically, GTA V is faultless. Many worried that the PC port would be terrible, but they really knocked it out of the park here.  The abundance of graphical options, audio options, and options in general, really make this a proper PC game.  The game can be played on a gamepad, or a mouse and keyboard. Normally with GTA games I opt for the game pad, but the game is so well optimized for the PC, the mouse and keyboard feel like the only option for me - it just plays so fluidly. 

I am going to go out on a limb here and say that GTA V is one of, if not the greatest video game out there today. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the game, and it excels in every area in which you will critic a game. The stellar gameplay, exquisite story line, and huge open world for you to explore;  it is hard to put this conclusion into words as to how perfect this game is – it is something you really need to be experiencing for yourself as this is a piece of history right here. 

 Tom's Score Card
1) Stay away
2) Not Recommended
3) Only recommended when on sale
4) Recommended
5) Highly recommended
6) This is a must play

												[Newer Review]

The Actual Final Update for my Grand Theft Auto Online Review. [12/11/2016]: Trainer Users are still there, Rockstar still does nothing about them but put up bans they can avoid, and get ban happy to third party apps, the wheels keep turning, don't bother buying this game on PC for online, it's a terrible Idea. 
DO NOT BUY IT ON PC FOR ONLINE.

 In addition, here's a minor list of things that can and will get you banned from GTA: Online

- Used a memory optimization program (CleanMem, Razor Cortex, etcetera)

- Attempting to force AA or other graphical effects through your drivers

- Using a Field of View mod (They actually lied about saying this is acceptable)

- Having any file in the GTA folder that was not shipped with the game (Literally anything)

- Leftover log files from singleplayer mods

- Discord when it hooks into a game via an Overlay can get you banned

[Trainers don't get banned since they hide the way they hook into the game.]

 (Fun little videos)

 I ran Both Cleanmem and Razor Cortex and got banned in 4 hours after playing with some friends, a little while after watching someone use a trainer. I narrowly missed getting Discord Thrown in with those two.

There's a lot of people calling out falsely for bans but if you search around for specific reasons you find a ton of people getting banned from very specific explainable things.

This multi-million dollar company will never spend the money to make a valuable port, or put in proper Anti-Cheat, don't trust them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

[Older]

Final Update. [7/20/2016]: A bit over year later Rockstar finally updates their game enough to consider that it has a bit of Anti-Cheat now to ban people at a faster rate and prevent cheats from the start and is working quite well considering many haven't seen many script users, I've seen at least 2 but it has been very spaced out and only briefly using it very blatantly, it has helped it out a lot to not have said issues persist as strong as they used to and I can recommend it, but I won't take down this review since it took over a year to lock-down the issues and still not have a statement on it, or anything else to say why it took so long, the game is harder to mod for the better and the worst because of their implementations, modding the game will trigger the anti-cheat they are using and ban the user, so if you have any interest in modding and online you can only pick between the two and stick with it, otherwise your SOL.

As a final note I would recommend picking the game up for 30 Dollars, or Less, it's a fun game and it's a little less toxic with the removal of rampant use of mod menus and general scripts, at full price I can't recommend it if your interested in online, it's toxic as any game would be with such free reign, but if you enjoy being aggressive towards other players then it's fine and full price is acceptable, SP is still as good as ever but MP is still brought down a bit with the player base being really trigger happy and aggressive to ♥♥♥♥ every ones ♥♥♥♥ up whether they are interested, or not.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

[Oldest Review]

Don't get the game for Online, Until Rockstar adds some sort of SERIOUS Anti-Cheat, The Online Portion is absolutely ruined.

If your looking for a open world game with an interesting SINGLE Player Story, Or Private Multiplayer with friends, Then this is for you, But if your looking for some drop in and have some open world fun with 30 players, Expect to be abruptly blown up, Gain Millions in cash, Lose said millions in cash, Gain guns you never bought, Lose said guns you never bought, And then have your car deleted all from users playing with trainers.

Rockstar Cares about your cash, Not your experience in the game, Dont buy it for half the game, Buy it for the full game when they actually make half the game playable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATES TO ISSUES THAT PLAGUE HALF THE GAME:

12/16/2015: Update: There's already a work around with trainers, Unknown if their system is working forward to banning them after a bit.

12/15/2015: Update: Nothing has exceptionally changed for the better, Recent Patch Notes say that they have updated and tweaked their anti-cheat measures, Ussually trainers would be up and running in a few hours, So far nothing has come up.

7/11/2015: UPDATE TO TRAINERS: Players using scripts and what not can now go invisible and hide themselves from others entirely, Add that onto the ability to launch others into the air at a whim, Or having molitovs explode on them, As well as exploding, the only thing actively being gaurded right now is the money, And that's still being shot out from miniguns, Or simply dropped onto player's heads.

To gather information if you wish to report a player, the best option is to find a TV ingame and use spectate to report a player that is invisible, They can still be seen even if their husk isn't visible.

6/16/2015: UPDATE TO SO CALLED ""ANTI-CHEAT"": The script creators already found an easy workaround around the brief scan, It's stopped all money drops long term because they are monitoring it a bit more heavily, But they can do everything else in between still, I'm still suggesting anyone to really think about getting the game.

6/10/2015: UPDATE TO THE TRAINER ISSUE: The issue still persists to this date, But is now raised to where Users of said Trainers are targeting players calling out users and reporting players using trainers to rockstar, They can remove the bans placed against them, They can remove all in-game reports on them, They've ruined Online, I implore you to reconsider at all costs as to buying GTA 5 For online, They have so much power in Online and rockstar is not showing any hint of helping out the common player on GTA besides for giving us cash for the cars/ammo/guns we have lost and saying, ""Sorry for your inconvenience."", Perhaps they've forgotten who makes their games so popular.

------------------------------------------------------------------

[Summary]
------------
 The game has massive issues with memory tied to a leak that has persisted from launch, and just overall hogs a lot of memory, do not tamper with anything related to the game with how it handles memory, you will get banned. 

 My Final Words as someone whos played Grand Theft Auto since I was a child is don't grab this game on PC, it's not worth it at all, better graphics be damned, the game has so many issues on PC that Rockstar should be ashamed to have put such a title out, but that doesn't matter in the end they'll get sales, they'll meet their qoutas, time will continue on with them getting more and more sales.

I finish my time with Grand Theft Auto 5 as a series with 1,455 Hours that I wish I never had logged on to buy it on PC, I won't be buying another game of theirs again with how poor they treat their customers and how poorly they treat PC entirely from removing content from San Andreas and removing music/ruining performance on a 10 year old game, poor performance with GTA4, and then just poor treatment of their customers with their support and ban happy treatment to users in an attempt to keep online safe while still neglecting adding in true Anti-Cheat.

------------

TL;DR: Online Portion Ruined by Trainers, minor things get you banned, Single Player is Absolutely Amazing if you like the GTA Series and ""good"" Characters."

More ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t: Each update, breaks almost every single existing mod, and adds even more confusion in modding community.Also, ♥♥♥♥♥tar, it's not that hard to add a separate .exe for online, to stop the cheaters. Stop being idiots.

And here we go again, update. Now Rockstar bans modders that actually helped to sell the game, the ones who did their own multiplayer THAT REQUIRED LEGIT COPY of the game, they banned their accounts, and now they cant play this game, or the other games they owned that are using R* Social club.

Goooood job, Rockstar. My reccomendation: Go ♥♥♥♥ing pirate it.

And update: Rockstar FULLY Shut down FiveM, great job digging your own grave, R*."

So now we can't go into public sessions because we could get permas because of someone giving us money, and we cant go into a private session because then we can't do CEO or Biker missions...

												We had fun in GTA Online before my friend got banned out of nowhere.

Yeah, the public playerbase was pretty bad, and the business model was scummy, but truth be told, my overall experience was great.

Playing mostly on private servers, my group of friends and I built characters from nothing together. As we made money, playing stupidly-fun minigames and going on deathmatch rampages, we created our characters’ lore. Buying new outfits, houses, and cars, we created the personalities and relationships between our characters. From the first convenience store robberies we committed to the “hard mode” heists we tried over and over to beat, everything we did spawned stories of our virtual lives.

After 140+ hours of glorious, stupid fun, we took about a month’s hiatus. We played a few other group-based games, such as ESO and Don’t Starve Together, but we ended up feeling inclined to reunite our virtual characters in GTA Online. After this time away, we were ready to have some more fun, reuniting in a game that brought us all closer together as a group.

That was until one of us logged on, saw that they had been suspended for 30 days, and read that their character had been completely reset.

Why was our friend banned? Who knows. Based on what I’ve read (and we’ve been studying into it for hours in hopes of getting our friend's character back), there’s no hope. Rockstar’s employed some sort of algorithm that ends up banning both guilty hackers and innocent players alike out of nowhere, with no distinction. I’m not going to lie, when we went onto public servers we frequently met hackers. The issue is that my friend wasn’t one of them.

“You have violated the EULA,” the suspension email states, “this decision is final.”

Rockstar, you know how to make a really good game - Red Dead Redemption and both Grand Theft Auto 4 & 5 were excellent in single-player - but I can’t support this blatant lack of care for supporting your online players. 60 dollars and 140+ hours just went down the drain, because your robot randomly banned our friend, you won’t say why, and none of your “support” staff (if they even exist) care to respond to any players in the same situation.

I won’t support this bafflingly unprofessional treatment of GTA Online’s playerbase.

=====

Basically, single player is great. Online can be as well, but good luck not getting suspended or banned out of nowhere, for no reason. You won’t know why you were banned. You won’t get support. You’ll lose time and money. And Rockstar won’t even care."

												This game is great, until you go to play online... It takes waaay to long to load online (close to 5 minutes on a high end pc like mine) and once you get there it is miserable to play. Nearly every session i have joined the past 2 weeks has at least one hacker either giving everyone money, or just running around with invincibility killing everyone. What finally pushed me over the edge is when I was playing online with a friend doing our own thing and then all of a sudden everyone on the server dies because they are crushed by falling rocks, then there is a clone of the character stuck to my body and even after killing it and myself, it just stayed. It only gets worse, my friend and I didn't mind it to much and it was a bit comical at times, but then we are all killed again except this time blown up which destroyed my car that I had to make the claim on and drained all cash and removed all guns. About 30 seconds after that it was flooded, literally. I did what a responsible person would do and reported the hacker as i have to most of the other hackers that I pass by and what does Rockstar do? Nothing. Absolutely &%$#ing nothing to the point where I saw the same hacker a week later doing the same thing in a different server. It has gotten to the point where I don't even bother playing online anymore because you simply can't.

TL:DR Version:
Rockstar needs to get it together with banning hackers, and until then, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you plan on playing online or it will be miserable for you."

												Rockstar just lost a lot of respect from a large part of it's playerbase. 

(UK Customer) I paid £39.99 on release, current standalone price is £51.98 but a -25% discount makes it £38.98. This kind of business practice is actually against ASA regulations, raising the price of a game and then putting it on sale to make it look like it's actually reduced is not considered a fair marketing strategy in the UK.

With regards to the bundle with ""Great White Shark Cash Card"" at the same price of £38.98, it's a move that isn't really on the side of the consumer or in the spirit of past steam sales. It has only been out for 2 months on PC so I don't think anyone was hoping for a big discount but putting it in a bundle and slapping a -25% discount on it really means the consumer isn't saving at all. They're getting some free in-game money which might be nice for some people but I think if most wanted the game + In-game money bundle they'd have prepurchased it when the in-game money was also free. 

I hope people don't just see the -25% discount and think they're getting a great deal by saving 25%, beacuse they're really not. You're either getting some free in-game money or - even worse - nothing at all with the standalone discount. GTA V is a great game but if you were looking to save on it you won't be in this current steam sale.

Rockstar, please treat your customers with more respect."

												So. GTAV. I cant say Ive ever had a game I both loved and hated at the same time.
I'll start off by saying that this game IS good. My negative review is simply because it doesnt deserve such high praise.

Everything in this game thats good is offset by something bad, almost always tied directly to Rockstar being greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The world is incredible. Beautiful map, the amount of detail is astonishing. The vehicles are fantastic. Theres plenty to do and see. Its also a NIGHTMARE to play.

You'd think some of that over $500,000,000 they made JUST IN MICROTRANSACTION SALES would go into moderating the online play, but that would cut into their profits.

It is next to impossible to join a single server that isnt plagued with MULTIPLE modders. Almost all of which do nothing but blow you up, teleport and godmode their way to win events, strip your weapons, and crash your client. Considering the price of EVERYTHING in this game is set by Rockstar to try to make you buy their horrendously overpriced shark cards, Having modders ruin damn near everything in the game that you can use to make money makes it next to impossible to buy anything if you werent lucky enough to have had cash dumped on you ages ago that didnt get you banned. The only modders Rockstar ever seems to even try to deal with are the ones that spawn money, because Rockstar doesnt care about players who are ruining the game, only ones that might make them lose money from microtransactions.

Once Rockstar has your money for the game, they dont give a ♥♥♥♥ how your gameplay is.

They even removed the ability to email information about modders in, which could include video footage. Now its just the report button. Which the latest mod menus seem to be able to block from sending anyways, from what everyone says now.

I dont regret having bought the game, but its saddening to see Rockstar going the way of EA and so many AAA game devs these days. I'll honestly have to think hard about it on whether I'd be willing to buy a new GTA after this one.

I miss the developer that ruined my childhood innocence with San Andreas back in the day. Come back Rockstar."

												Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action adventure game developed by Rockstar North. This game is the fifteenth in the series. The game was originally released on Xbox 360 and PS3 in mid-2013, and then got a remastered version on Xbox One and PS4 in late 2014, before finally being released on the PC in April 2015.  The game quite rightly is a record setter, selling over 11 million copies and grossing over $800 million on the release day, before breaking the $1 billion marker three days afterwards. 

GTA V continues in tradition with the type of game play on offer. You play in third person over the shoulder view of the characters. The game has three main protagonists, who each have their own story and plot to go with them – somehow all three of these characters’s path cross throughout the game and they soon become key to each other’s story.  The driving in the game has been improved over the previous versions of the game, cars feel even more realistic to drive and the game’s physics engine is almost perfect with figuring out how objects will react should you hit them (or they hit you!). The gun play in this game is significantly better than the previous versions also, I did have issues with aiming and general fight scenes before, but GTA V sets out the controls and feel of the gameplay perfectly allowing you to not run into any stumbling blocks in terms of the controls or mechanics.  I did find the flying missions to be quite annoying at times, since I was playing the game on mouse and keyboard, I found the controls to be a bit fumbly when manning a helicopter or plane, but the flying parts of the game are few and far between.  The main core of the game revolves around completing story missions for each of the three main characters; these can range from stealing cars for a billionaire’s collection, right the way to robbing banks. There is plenty of variety in the missions you can do, and you will find it very difficult to find a moment in this game where you are bored. 

The game has gorgeous graphics, no they aren’t photo realistic, but that’s because the game’s style isn’t aiming for that. The PC version of this game is most certainly the pinnacle of gaming; it just puts the console’s version to shame when you compare the two.  My rig which is a monster, couldn’t handle putting the game out at 60 fps at 4k resolutions, but was quite happy to run every setting at maximum on 1080p, and it just looks fantastic. Normally open world games try to reduce the graphics slightly just because how much is being loaded at any one time, but GTA V does none of that; each of the textures are all high res, animation is absolutely perfect, and the lighting effects are some of the best I have seen in any video game. 

As with all GTA games, you are going to get a blockbuster style story line, this is one of the best, if not THE best plot to any video game and one which I will remember. All three of the character’s story are so well written, and perfectly intertwining with each other.  The game does have a large amount of cut scenes at the beginning of each level, some people may find this to be annoying as they would rather be playing the story rather than watching it; but personally I found the cut scenes to be just as interesting to watch as it is to play the game. They fully immerse you into the world of Los Santos. Not only is there a captivating main story to the game, there are also plenty of side missions whilst they are all quite basic tasks for you to complete, they all have some sort of story behind them for each character, which are all well worth your time in completing. 

The sound effects and voice acting goes above and beyond here as well. Every single one of the characters is so perfectly voice acted that you sometimes forget that these aren’t real people in front of. The ambiance sounds of the city are all amazing too, there is never a moment where there is just silence, whether it is people in the street chatting to each other, or someone getting road rage, there is always something going on.  Not to mention the game has 162 songs on the radio station, so you will always find something you are in the mood for when you are traveling across the map. 

The game isn’t exactly hard, there are missions which you will probably have to do over again because of silly reasons, such as crashing your plane from not being able to land it (I have had to do one of the missions way too many times to remember because of this!!), but I don’t think I actually died in a gun fight or a heist of any kind, since most of the time you are with one of the other characters you always have some kind of backup should things turn nasty. 

Los Santos is one of the biggest game worlds to ever be made, it is bigger than GTA IV, GTA SA and Red Dead Redemption combined. Whilst a good portion of the map is mountain ranges and open fields of emptiness in the northern regions, the actual city is a bustling hive of entertainment and action. Round every corner there is something for you to do, whether it be a side missions that involves you getting your mother the drugs she needs, helping a young lady get her purse back after being robbed (or not?) or just earning an honest day’s work by towing cars that are parked illegally. The world is your oyster in Los Santos.

The main story with a good portion of side missions and extras in GTA V took me just about forty six hours to complete. Whilst the main story is complete, I still have plenty of heists, extra missions, stunts, races…so much more to finish! The single player alone in this game can probably hit the heights of eighty hours if you want to complete everything, and it is something I am going to be aiming to do over the course of the next few months. Never have I played a game that has made me want to do that more! Having only played the game through once, I cannot be 100% sure on this, but I feel there is a slight portion of the game which can change depending on what actions you take towards the latter stages of the story so if you do want to replay the game again, there is going to be a bit of a different story at the end of it depending on what you choose. 

Technically, GTA V is faultless. Many worried that the PC port would be terrible, but they really knocked it out of the park here.  The abundance of graphical options, audio options, and options in general, really make this a proper PC game.  The game can be played on a gamepad, or a mouse and keyboard. Normally with GTA games I opt for the game pad, but the game is so well optimized for the PC, the mouse and keyboard feel like the only option for me - it just plays so fluidly. 

I am going to go out on a limb here and say that GTA V is one of, if not the greatest video game out there today. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the game, and it excels in every area in which you will critic a game. The stellar gameplay, exquisite story line, and huge open world for you to explore;  it is hard to put this conclusion into words as to how perfect this game is – it is something you really need to be experiencing for yourself as this is a piece of history right here. 

 Tom's Score Card
1) Stay away
2) Not Recommended
3) Only recommended when on sale
4) Recommended
5) Highly recommended
6) This is a must play

									Product received for free

												Alright boys and girls, super salty rant time. This game is not worth the money if you want it for Online only. I repeat, if you are only interested in Online, *DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME* there have been a lot of false bans being issued recently and R* DOES NOT care if you were falsely banned. I have been banned for 4 days now and I have written 4 tickets to support, three of which have recieved the same response. Two were from a bot, the third was a real person but still the same response. I don't have a god damn clue why I was banned because Ive never modded, never exploited, and never even recieved money from any other players. The only thing Ive done in the game is cuss some guy out because he called me a f aggot after I said he was salty. Supposedly you can be banned for being overly racist, homophobic, or disrespectful towards a religion... I cussed someone out for using homophobic slurs. I defended homosexuals while he bashed them. So, if that warrants a ban, ♥♥♥♥ me right? Ive done everything I could to contact R* support INCLUDING the 4 support tickets (as mentioned above), a forum post, tweets @ and DM's to both their support and games accounts, and Ive even called the support line over 100 times, only to never talk to a human. All Ive asked for in my tickets/dms/posts/whatever is a reason for being banned, or a removal of the ban. Yet Im still no closer to understanding why I was banned. IF and ONLY if I hear back from support BEFORE my ban is automatically lifted, I will alter this review to reflect upon it. But as of right now, I cannot recommend this game for anyone only interested in the Online feature. As of this particular point in time, I wont be playing Online until I get a response from R* support telling me why I was banned in the first place, because Ive read many a post about people being banned, not knowing why, then getting banned again after attempting to play Online again. 

Go ahead and say what you want, Im sure I'll get lots of ""You cheated, you got caught, deal with it."" comments, but I know that I havent broken any rules and I could honestly care less what people assume of me.

EDIT: They never got back to me. BUT, I would like to say that a few of the known programs that can trigger a false ban are things like TeamSpeak, Discord, and Skype as well as (possibly) Steams FPS counter or recording software like Bandicam and Fraps."

												Grand Theft Auto V is a game set within the fictional state of San Andreas which is based on Southern California and its developers has done a great job of replicating real world locations. The game is very well optimized as well compared to the previous title, Grand Theft Auto IV which was such a disastrous game to run.

The gameplay is quite fast-paced, gunplay feels fun and satisfying. Driving in this game stroke a minor controversy as it felt a bit too 'casual' compared to the previous major installment, GTA 4. The graphics are phenomenal for an open world game and the level of detail in the world is incredible and the city feels very lively with a variety of NPC pedestrians scattered across the map . 

The story is fun and well written. There are three led protagonists throughout single player and players can switch between them. Each of every mission in the game's story mode is unique so they don't feel very repetitive. When the story is over there really isn't much left to do however, there are a number of activities in which you can engage in single player such as racing, hanging out with your friends, hunting down the wild life and playing sports but they're not as fun as they ought to be. 

GTA Online is probably the main reason why people get this game but in my opinion it barely has any redeeming qualities and I don't know why people are buying the game just for this. Firstly, the concept of playing around in a huge open world with friends just simply sounds fun and it actually is, surprisingly. There are a couple of things you can play in Online mode, missions, heists, races and adversary mode which has a variety of game modes. But that's pretty much about it for the fun aspects of Online, now for the cons. Online is very, very grindy and is just pretty repetitive overall. Let's just say that you have a wish to buy a vehicle that costs around 2 million dollars (just a reference) which is pretty easy to get in single player, but it's different Online. You will have to repeatedly do the same missions / heists / works over and over until you get enough money and by the time you get the vehicle you will feel a sense of satisfaction for a short while until you find another vehicle you want to get. Sure, there are micro transactions called shark cards which add money into your character but for the price it's not worth it at all. Another negative of the Online mode is hackers, they ruin the fun of the game and makes it worse especially when the game itself isn't much fun.

To sum it up, I think the game is pretty good, especially the single player campaign but I do not think that it is worth spending $60 USD just for it and the multiplayer is trash in my opinion but do buy this on a sale if you have money to spare."

												Beautiful and awesome game, especially when playing with friends, but has non-existant customer support.
Hackers are everywhere and rockstar's system only seems to ban legit players, furthermore, they will not accept responsibility for this and will not unban you regardless if you have 100's of hours in game and/or have poured money into the P2W system.
It has one fo the most toxic communities out there, you can't drive anywhere without being obliterated by some dude who's hacked in a tank. The new update only encourages this by telling everyone in the session to kill anyone doing missions for minimal payout.
8/8 was a CEO and lost money to random hackers/greifers online, then got banned because having your internet drop out whilst customising a car is an attempted 'money glitch.'

All of rockstar's efforts and funds have been put into making money and trying to protect it with anti hacker systems so strict they ban regular players and not a decent support system or more interesting content.

EDIT

Rockstar's 1 month ban is now over, I contacted them multiple times through their ticket system and by phone to no avail so I waited it out. They also decided to remove the 2 mil I grinded for hours to get."

												I feel I can only write a review for GTA Online, as Grand theft Auto V has been left in the dust since it launched on PC, All of Rockstar's attention goes into GTA Online now. Buying GTA V is basically just a means of distribution for the Online component.

I'm level 99 or something like that, I feel I've played the game long enough to have a solid opinion on it, so let's begin.



- Base game hasn't recieved an update since the first weeks of launch, they don't even port Online cars to it anymore. And they have been actively taking steps to prevent people from spawning online cars in singleplayer. Looks like they don't want you trying something before you spend half a million GTAbucks on it only to find you don't like it. 

- Very few of the updates have added any genuine features or changes, most of the time it's the usual combonation of a new vehicle or two, a gun that no one wants, like the antique pistol for example, and some tacky clothing options.  For an online game that's technically been going for 3 years, there's been very little innovation.

- The whole point of the game is to make money so that you can buy toys, and once you've got everything you want, and once you get bored of the missions, adversary modes and races, and get tired of screwing around in freemode, the game becomes pointless, just a never ending quest to buy more and more overpriced cars and clothing for no better reason than to promote your internet ego, and then realize that everyone else in the game is driving Chrome Adders and sitting on golden Yachts

- Rockstar doesn't think when it comes to implementing game features, the bad sport system is horribly abused. More often than not I find myself getting ""bad sport points"" for doing nothing else but defending myself against an Armoured Kuruma full of raging teenagers who are killing everyone on sight.  Do that enough and all of a sudden you're broke, and forced to play in a lobby full of dunce hatted griefers and cheaters... not that there's any difference between the dunce lobbies and the normal ones, and on the topic of cheating

- The cheating is just insane. it's out of control, Rockstar has lost whatever grip they have on this game, and usually it's not someone cheating in a competitive mode or a co-op mission, more often than not it's just straight out griefing.  Getting C130s dropped on you, cars exploding for no reason, having a gang of stripper NPCs with miniguns spawned on you.  And then you've also got people who spawn moneybags on others, which completely removes any reason for playing legitimately because Rockstar rarely bans, punishes or otherwise goes after anyone who gets hacked money, just the one who spawned it. They slap cheaters on the wrist, often using a strike system, the first 2 or 3 times you're caught, you get banned for a week or two. It should be permanent. There is no excuse for the amount of hacking that goes on in a game of this size

- Free roam is a toxic swamp of internet tough guys, racists, griefers, hackers, tryhards, screamers and squeakers. Freeroam was supposed to be the place where you get to show off, and play with all the things you earned during your missions, and you're extremley hard pressed to find a lobby that isn't full of hackers, Raging griefers with tanks, or one with a blood raging argument going on over voice/chat.

GTA Online is like one of the seven circles of hell, it's a circle of hell reserved for the morons and half-wits who get off to a toxic, unforgiving and completeley malicious enviornment.

It's a shame, because GTA V isn't that bad of a game,  I think GTA IV was ahead of it's time, and I still enjoy it even though it doesn't run too well anymore for some reason.   but GTA V has largely been forgotten since it first launched, because in this industry, if an action game isn't an online game, it's irrelevant.

GTA V: An impressive technical achievement, hit some nails on the head, missed some others compared to it's predecessors.

GTA Online: A toxic pisshole that should be avoided at all costs."

												How about you marketing sharks stick the GREAT WHITE SHARK CASH CARD up YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥. Increasing the price of a product just before a sale starts is not just scummy...no... it's absolutey disgusting and mostly prohibited by law. I hope you choke on your ♥♥♥♥ing money!"

												STOP BUYING SHARK CARDS!! Rockstar has made over 3 billion dollars off GTA 5 and at least half a billion is from shark cards.  With all that money they are still unwilling to put any real effort towards solving the hacking problem. They can't find any safe guards against it and won't hire moderators for the sessions. You can only report individual hackers and not a hacked session. Most of the time you won't know who is hacking the session. And be warned, this GTA online hacking problem is not over exaggerated.  It is unbelievably rampant. It's literally in nearly all sessions. Wanna do the new CEO or biker missions, prepare to have a modder take control of your vehicle and kill you, making the hours of work you did be for nothing. You really need to prepare yourself for the reality that you will do hours of work and have it completely ruined by modders. This will guarantee-ably happen to you if you play GTA online. It's actually gotten so bad that hacker paranoia has set in everywhere. People are calling each other hackers everywhere you go in the game. Rockstar does not deserve anymore money until they make some progress with this huge problem."

												So there I was at 12am in the morning. I remember the great times I've had on console, so I buy GTA V for $30. It takes me four hours to download the massive 70gb game. I start GTA Online and start to drive around in a car and terrorize the civilians. After an hour of gameplay I decide to go to sleep.

When I wake up I see an email from Rockstar. ""Rockstar Games Account Suspension and Character Reset Notification"" (which was an email sent by them 50mins after i stopped playing). I remember looking at the reviews about the game and seeing people complain that they've been mysteriously banned for no reason. 

So I think about the situation. I just bought the game, I just gave these people my money, I played for maybe a little more than an hour of GTA Online, AND NOW IM BANNED. 

Have I ever exploited the game with any malicious programs? NO I LITERALLY JUST BOUGHT THE GAME FOR $30 ON MY MAIN ACCOUNT (WHICH IS CLEAN).

Also to make it just all that much better, these people don't give you any information as to why you were banned, they just tell you that you have violated their rules and tell you how long you're banned for.

So in the Rockstar support pages it says that 3rd party applications don't cause bans in GTA Online. Yea right. 

SO WHAT COULD IT BE?! Could it be that I said one thing in chat which consisted of ""hi guys."" Could it be that I shot civilians and ran from the police? Could it be that I slightly damaged another player's car when I rear-ended it? Nope, i guarantee it isn't any of those things.

These people have made billions off of GTA V, so why would they care about my petty $30? 

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. YOU ARE GUARANTEED A BAN.

These people are too lazy to actually do anything about their rotting reputation.

Seriously please do not buy the game guys it seriously makes you feel worthless and degraded. To explain my story hopefully a little better. I bought GTA V for $30 off of Steam because I remember the fun times I had on console. It takes so many hours to download and once it's done I am excited. After the prologue, I head into GTA Online because it's my first experience on pc. In summary, I shot civilians, stole cars, ran from the cops, typical GTA stuff, I didn't PVP. 

To convice you others that I am a legitimate player, this is my main steam account. This is my first time playing GTA Online on the computer. Why would I waste $30 on my MAIN account just to hack a game? AND why would I spend quite a long time writing this review if I were an actually cheater?

CONCLUSION I realize that I have actually violated Rockstar's agreements. To play GTA V without being randomly banned you must ensure that your computer doesn't have any programs Rockstar doesn't like? In my case it could've just been cheat engine sitting on my computer, not running. GTA V is a great game, but Rockstar's auto ban system seems faulty to me but that's just my opinion."

												Don't get me started on GTA Online. It's only matter of time before R* closes solo session and private session or pays troller more by successfully annoy other player (Crate delivery, Import / Export, you know it) or probably makes the game itself harder by applying more sh*tty policies and such (No garage access during Pacific Heist, etc. CMIIW) w/ purpose to punish players more while playing it or force players to buy Shark Cash Cards instead just heavy grinding in specific heists or side missions, hell IDK...

Aside from being exaggerating, don't buy this game. Hell even just for enjoying Story Mode - it's not worth it for $50 price tag (Wait till it discounted like around 66% - 75%)"

												Long story short, after over 600 hours of gameplay (most of which is online, my character was around level 214), I get suspended for no discernable reason and my character reset. 

November 8th: Me and a few friends decided to try the new Deadline game mode after messing around in a private free mode lobby for a while. We do this, and when were done, I got sent in to a public game for about a minute before I quit the game. Approximately two hours later, I get an email saying my account broke the EULA and terms of service, and I have been suspended for 30 days and my stats reset. Why? I have never once cheated/hacked/modified my game files. If I had to guess, there was probably a hacker in the public game I was in, and I was in just long enough to get dragged along with him. All the horror stories about getting suspended are true, I found out. I tried contacting support and got a copy/paste response about how the ban system works. My friend also contacted them and got a name for me to ask for, even going to the length of calling their support hotline and speaking to a (rather cocky) employee who told him that I would have to call (the entire call was also recorded). It was late at night at the time I heard about it so instead of calling, I sent in another ticket explaining in detail what happened, and mentioned his ticket number and the persons name...same response. Thanks Rockstar for taking over 600 hours of gameplay away from me for no real reason. I loved GTA Online, but after this, I am never buying any of your products again.

My boyfriend and another friend of mine made videos on it if anyone is curious.

			Rockstar wouldn't listen to our tickets so maybe this will get their attention. For the past few days my boyfriend has been banned from GTA:O for no apparant reason.

												I recommend the game. It's a solid port. However, Rockstar is absolutely NOT a trustworthy company for PC gamers.

So, in addition to stringing along the PC community for years since GTA V's announcement, the countless absurd delays, and now the Summer Sale price gouging?

Everyone's missing that all those bundles they're packaging with GTA V? They're non-refundable because they go straight to Rockstar's service.

It took them days to decide to abuse and circumvent Valve's refund service. Days.

You may have finally made a solid PC port, Rockstar, but you are absolutely f*cking with things any person or company with a shred of morality would not be f*cking with."

												600 hours. Great game. Came back on to have some fun with an old friend and to check out the new updates. We did some CEO missions and drove around, deciding not to bother the other players and do our own thing. I log off the game. Five minutes later i receive an email stating i have violated the EULA and my account, character, and inventory have all been reset. Years of work. Gone. I decided to give the game another chance after the same scenario had happened to my best friend before the reset was a thing, just to have it happen to me. Don't get me wrong, we had a blast driving around, grinding up enough money to finally buy the vehicles and homes we wanted, then proceed to try the new modes as they came out like the racing, CEO, adversary modes. I saw all these negative reviews on the page stating how people had been randomly banned, and when they brought this up on the forums, they were called ""liars"" and told ""Dont cheat again ♥♥♥"". I thought they were full of ♥♥♥♥ until it happened to me. I have no chance of getting all i've worked for back unless i buy their damn shark cards, and even then, whos to say they wont ban me again? I can say the uninstall button worked better than the anti-cheat, as ive seen countless modders roaming around unopposed, causing hell to other players. Im 90% sure that the majority of answers im going to get for this review are going to be the ""regulars"" who claim everyone hacks or cheats except them, and that i won't be missed. Thats fine. Just note Rockstar, if you by chance read my lovely review, you've lost another customer. I will never buy from you again. It was fun while it lasted but in the end, even i was beaten by a robot with the banhammer, with no reason, or ♥♥♥♥s given."
