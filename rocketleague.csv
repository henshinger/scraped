												This is my new favourite game! I love it, it is so fun to play with you friends or alone. There are some really cool custom items to put on your car to make it look awesome plus the DLCs don't cost alot either. I can play this game for hours on end without getting bored.

												It's super fun, it's a blast with friends, and there's splitscreen multiplayer for a PC game for once. I love this game and I already bought a shirt with the logo.

If you have a dual monitor set-up, I recommend you look into changing the game's resolution to span both screens for 2-player. The UI scales perfectly and you'll each have your own full-screen view!"

												Rocket League is a damn good game. It's fun, very addicting and the gameplay can be quite humorous at times. Just playing this game for a few minutes is relaxing and laid back. If you want to play it competitively you can, and if you don't, you can play it casually just as well. 

This game made Soccer, a sport that I personally didn't care that much for, fun for me. Rocket League, simply put, is a very entertaining game that will give you hours of constant enjoyment. Suffice it to say, I think this game is well worth your money and I, for one, am glad to have played it.

8.5/10: ""A very fun game that will leave you highly entertained and wanting for more after every single match."""

												Rocket League - a dynamic racing game in the style of football, developed and published by Psyonix for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. The game is on 7 July 2015. This game is a sequel to the game in 2008 Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket engine Battle-Cars (SARPBC). Game gameplay is similar to the game SARPBC and includes single and multiplayer (support split screen) mode, has the opportunity to play on a local network, cross-platform Includes game and PS4 between Microsoft Windows.

 Pros: 

1. Gameplay.

The game has a couple of modes: 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2, 3 vs. 3, 4 vs. 4, 3 vs. 3 Hockey and new clothes often go to various other modes and maps.

Where online game without matchmaking? 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2, 3 vs. 3, 4 vs. 4 - for all these modes, you can get the title (rank). In each mode, its title, that is, you can sit down for a long time in one mode, in addition to it you will find more then 3. However, I highly recommend that you do not play in matchmaking, because after him, you can spoil your mood.

And yes, even in the game there are different machines and tuning them. It is very cool!

2. Team play.

The multiplayer game is fully revealed potential game ideas. The most interesting part of this. Under the bot can already be arranged, but not real players. They may be misleading, to negotiate, to use clever tactics.

3. Graphics.

The graphics for the game in 6.5 $ just excellent.

4. Soundtracks.

They are perfectly matched and fit perfectly into the gameplay.

5. The idea of ​​the game.

Indeed, this is quite an interesting idea for a game. As I wrote above, this game is like a game gempleem Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle-Cars (SARPBC), but for some reason no one remembers the game as well?Developers Psyonix have reviewed all the disadvantages SARPBC games and made a bomb

 Minuses: 

1.Random.

What did I say?
For example, you can win the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to the forty-seventh chromosome, which can not use the elementary flight, and just waiting for rebounds, banal transmission through the entire field. And, of course, it is unpleasant.

 Conclusion: 

Despite all these drawbacks, the game I loved madly.
I thought a long time, take it or not this game, because I do not like football, but in the end he took and never regretted. Excellent arcade game, which will delay than a dozen hours."

												I play this too much.

I'm sure you've already heard numerous great things about this game. I can definitely agree to them. This game screams fun regardless of if you've played 1 hour or 1000 hours. Even if you're losing, you find yourself having fun. And that's the mark of a seriously great game, in my eyes.

Rocket League can be played casually or competitively, boasting both unranked and ranked queues. It is a simple enough concept that people are already familiar with even before playing their first game (it's damn soccer dude, if you don't know you've been living under a rock very far away from Europe, possibly on the moon Europa). But then, it has such an incredibly high skillcap. You'd probably still be learning new manouevres and the like well into 2000 hours (give it time though).

I don't play with a controller as I don't own one, but I know that 99% of people recommend controller over keyboard/mouse. And from an unbiased standpoint, I would agree, as the analogs make ball control and fine movement much easier than WASD or the like. Regardless, if you do choose to play keyboard like a dummie (read: like me), then consider making a custom bind that doesn't use the mouse.

I could go on and on. But I'll let the game do the talking; go buy it. Believe me, for $20, this is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing steal. Best $20 I ever spent tbh.

10/10 would play again (actually am playing as I write this)

												IntroductionI've often found myself with little pockets of time in which I've wondered, ""What should I do now?"". You know, those moments in time where you have too little time to play a really lengthy, story-driven game (or League of Legends), but way more time than you can feasibly sit and idle. It's as if our prayers were collectively answered with this fantastic game from Psyonix; Rocket League.

Take out your controllers boys & girls, we're playing football....with cars.

GameplayI've been playing games like Fifa and PES from the glory '98 days, but eventually my interests changed. After all, it was simply a game of football. There is only so much you can do with human players. Apparently Psyonix thought outside of the box. What they delivered was simply a stroke of genius. Gone were the human players we were accustomed to. Instead, rocket-powered cars jetted their way across the map in record speeds. This wasn't enough though. They altered the map, super-sized the ball, and set each player in control of only one car at a time.

This formula gave birth to the high-intensity game of Rocket League. Your goal is to hit the massive ball into the opponent's goal. Sounds simple enough right? Wrong. With rocket jumps, speed boosts, rocket-propelled flight and the unique map shapes, you'll find yourself in an endless chase at breakneck speed for possession of the ball. While this game is absolutely beginner friendly, it has an insanely high skill-ceiling. In other words, no matter how good you think you are, there is someone who is leagues above you.

Each team can have up to 5 players, though the 3v3 format is the standard mode, and has a nice balance between chaos and fun. The potential teamwork between players is definiely one of my favourite aspects, and promotes friendly behavior for those epic goals. Don't be surprised if you get called out for accidentally hitting the ball away from the opponent's goal, or worse, hitting it into your own.

Quick-chat commands are rather peaceful, but after seeing 3 censored swear words, you'll probably get the idea. The sarcastic tones of ""What a Save!"" upon scoring a goal always gives me a chuckle, and the genuine compliments from opponents is a welcome breath of fresh air, and pride.

Car selection & customization should probably be a mini-game on its own. With a wide variety of colours, hats, boost trails and decals to choose from, you'll likely have more than a few saved presets that you'll cycle through. With an ever-growing roster of cars and cosmetics, there's plenty to appeal to everyone.

Speaking of appeal, there's much more than your classic game of football in Rocket League. Games such as basketball and hockey have found their way into the ever-growing list of game modes, and I often find myself cycling through them all quite frequently. Hell, even my 5 year old cousin loves it. Think you've got the skills to make it higher? You'll be happy to test your skills in the competitive mode. To be honest, I haven't really played much of this, since I prefer the other modes so much more.

VisualsDon't let its colourful nature confuse you, rocket league is one beautiful & optimized game. I was pleasantly surprised to discover how easy it was to run on even some old potatoes, and its ability to be quite visually appealing on higher settings. The explosions and particle effects are both colourful and beautiful. The cars are nicely detailed, and the animations are right on point. 

AudioIf you for some reason haven't listened to Rocket League's soundtrack, get it...now. I find myself upset that it's not on by default while playing, but there are plenty of workarounds to really listen and enjoy the music all year round. The tracks are entertaining and insanely high quality. 

Soundtrack aside, the regular SFX are no less impressive. Vehicle sounds, explosions, and the 'fake crowd' cheering are just a few of the many things this game has to offer for your audiophile needs.

Summary & ConclusionWhether you've got only 5 minutes to spare, or an entire afternoon, Rocket League offers hours of addictive fun that never seems to grow old. This unique spin on a timeless sport is sure to appeal to a very wide audience, and you can be sure that your experience is likely gonna be a great one.

For $20, this game is worth full price, but you can always get it on sale pretty often.
I rarely grant this one but,

10/10 - Just simply fun, addicting and worth every penny.

Props to the devs for showing that an independent team could release such a big hit without submitting to the horrible DLC practices of modern gaming.

												So where do I start...

I read somewhere that the game is or was free for Playstation Live, yet PC users had to pay so that is extremely crappy!

Anyway, the game itself, that is why we are here.

Graphics: The graphics are actually pretty simple, pushed to the max that are nice to look at, simple and just nothing special really.  You do not need high resolution graphics for a game like this!

Audio: The audio is clear, crisp and really good to listen too, specially the rocket sounds of each trail you have, being different and acting different!

Controls: Depending how you play this game, the controls matter! I tried keyboard and mouse and although it is doable, it is a lot more complicated! I use an Xbox 360 controller to play this game, with BALL CAM always on and the game is suprt easy to master!

Gameplay: The gameplay is basically football but with cars... Nothing special or hard to get your head around.  There are some amazing players in the game, with some amazing shots you can make and for some odd reason, playing this game actually makes me intense and tense up at times, when taking a shot. 
The game is good fun and I would recommend this game if you like cars and/ or football... I hate football games but love car games and surprisingly this game offers an amazing balance of rockets, cars with a kinda football elemant, but in no way makes you feel like a football game.
The unlocks in the game you can get within a few hours, seriously it does not take long at all!

This game is now an E-Sports league thingy I heard, too which I am not interested in that but you can try to enter for it!

This is best to play with your friends, bringing you more fun.

Would I recommend this game? Yes!"

												I am a straight mess after playing this game. My throat hurts. My head hurts. I have been sweating non stop for the last 8 hours of gameplay. I will probably get noise complaints from my neighbors, and now I am completely exhausted. If that doesn't say ""good game"" then damn dude. 

The gameplay feels like if you made a football (soccer for you that care) game with the Trials (Evolution/Fusion) physics in mind. Tricky, akward, but once you get the feel for it fun as all get out. After figuring out the controlls I started finding my place in the team tactics. All the little unlockables are really fun too. I was running around in a pink buggy with a purple wizards hat, star decals on the side, a Saturn antenni bobble, and confetti coming out of my exhaust. I personally want rainbow sparkle exhaust, but I haven't unlocked that one yet. 

This game will gave you tourette syndrome. At least it did to me."

												I don't care about cars or football so i am surprised at how addictive and fun this is.

The good:
- Fast, fun and simple gameplay that is very easy to get in to.
- Great controls with controller support.
- You can make your car wear a viking helmet.
- Very nice and detailed graphics. You can see every single individual blade of grass on the field, it's actually pretty ludicrous that it runs at a constant 60fps.
- Thousands of people are playing the game so you can jump in to a match in about 20 seconds and it's (mostly) lag free.
- Did i mention you can make your car wear a viking helmet? That's a thing.

The bad:
- Not much. It could do with some more modes but i'm sure there will be many updates considering how popular the game is."

Whoever came up with this idea deserves a freakin cookie.  The game is beautiful, the gameplay is perfect, the community is active and generally pretty fun, and the soundtrack is awesome.  You can customize your cars which is always fun.  Also, cross-platform multiplayer!  PC players and PS4 players all play together, which is always a nice feature.

												HOTSHOT my friend already gave a fantastic review, so I will talk about one very important aspect to decide before buying the game:

Keyboards vs. Controllers
I never had to use a gamepad, okay sometimes I did for 2-player sessions on the same computer, but apart from that, this is the first time where I had to realize, controllers do give you the edge. And you need it if you don't want to uninstall the game after seeing others performing stunts practically impossible with the keyboard.

In a very fast-paced game like RL keyboard handling can easily turn out sub-par, as the followings are difficult to do:

Problems with keyboards
* Precision turning in a very short amount of time. Keyboard is not analog, so you have 2 choices: hold A/D/W/S and release when done, or tap those buttons in a rapid succession. You will find that you are going to be slower than guys with controllers.
* Acceleration and aerial turning forward is bound to the same key (W), so you would have to release W before flying in the desired direction. But, it is just too easy to forget, and you might end up forward flipping.

Not all controllers are supported!
This is one annoying feature, but after realizing that I would never become pro with a keyboard, I thought I could just dust off my old gamepad that I used to play NHL/FIFA/Mortal Kombat/NFS games with, but no, RL didn't even bother telling a message to me that, ""no I will just ignore your ***** controller!""

So you will need either an Xbox 360 controller for PC (either wired or wireless, doesn't matter, as long as it is for PC you will get a suitable USB cable with it), or what is better: an Xbox One controller for PC. Why better? People say the sticks feel better, so you will feel them easier to handle.

Oh yeah and PS controllers might work too but they aren't as convenient.

Will I need to install a driver?
No, at least on Windows 10 it's like plug and play.

How the controller works in the game
If you never had an Xbox controller like me, first thing to notice as a difference from regular controllers is that it has only 2 front buttons, rather than 4, and they will work like this:

Front right button: acceleration
Front left button: breaking / going backwards
Top left stick: turning (on ground and aerial)
A: jumping / pressing accept buttons in dialogs
B: nitro boost
X: drifting
Y: changing camera mode / pressing cancel buttons
Top right stick: camera angle
D-pad: navigation in the menu
Hardest parts are getting used to:

Accelerating and going backwards with the buttons on the front
Acceleration + nitro boosting + forward flipping at the same time (note: actually with nitro no need to accelerate)
Not accidentally hitting the jump button when you want to use the nitro boost.
Conclusion
At first it will be very hard to get used to the controller, it's like learning the game again, I actually went through the tutorials again, it felt really dumb. But keep practicing, because in the end I am pretty sure you will beat the guys using a keyboard having the same skill level as you."

												So, what makes this vehicular football game so great?

- Great gameplay
- Marvelous graphics
- Very competitive
- Alright singleplayer
- Tons of customization
- Easy to pick up, hard to master
- Up to 4-player splitscreen (!!)
- Cross-platform
+ Much more to experience for yourself!

Cons:
- Servers were pretty bad to begin with, but that's fixed now tho', so this should not count as a con.

Everything else that I would have written as a con, is currently being added, so I have no complaints about this game at all.

												 Rocket League: a synonym to the word ""awesomeness"" I have played many soccer games like PES & Fifa for many years now and i absolutely loved them! and i have played many racing games in the past years but sadly i absolutely hated each one of them! so when i first heard about this game i got confused; how could they mix two things that are totally different (at least for me), and how well could it be? in the end i used my money to buy something else thinking that i'm not gonna like it anyways .. Luckily, they made this free weekend and i finally had the chance to try it out after a long period of waiting and to be honest i got totally amazed! i don't know how to describe the feeling but this game is just great.
 i didn't had the chance to play it for long because i wasted most of my weekend downloading it but here are some positive things about it: (i couldn't find anything bad about it anyways)
+ brilliant idea for a game
+ It's so easy to learn 
+ solid game-play and smooth controlling
+ Beautiful graphics, and it doesn't require a PC gamer to run
+ there is no fancy upgrades or items that gives you extra abilities
+ all the cars have the same speed and abilities, it's all about you and your skills
+ you can make your car look like whatever you want! customize it using your own style
+ full of players, this game is so alive
+ no bugs, no crashed
+ played for 6 hours strait, didn't see a single cheater, and everyone was so nice with me, it's so rare to find such a friendly gaming community nowadays so this is a big up for the game
+ infinity hours of fun 
I'm really glad i tried this gem, i want to give a big thank you to the developers for giving us such a generous chance to try it out
i enjoyed every single moment of the 6 hours i played but unfortunately i don't have enough money at the moments so i guess i'll miss this sale .. for now this game is in the top of my wishlisted games and i'll try hard to get it as soon as possible i can 
for the rest of you out there, i wonder why are you guys still here reading this review? just go buy it now! it's a must have one. 10/10

Edit: as you already know i bought this game and spent more 45 hours playing it, it's absolutely amazing! i'll update this review as soon as i feel i'm ready, stay tuned! :P"

												What's in a Name?

Naming sequels should be a straight forward process shouldn't it?
You can use the same name of the original and just slap a number on the end (or if you're going for ""Artsy"" a roman numeral for extra gravitas).

Sometimes people try to overcomplicate things unnecessarily which annoys me.

I can get on board with the whole, Alien, Aliens, Alien3 thing,

I've even made my peace with the Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 fiasco
(Did they make a Windows 9? and was it so bad they had to lock it in the attic to hide it from the neighbours and feed it fish heads in a bucket when no one's looking?)

Anyway some naming systems for sequels defy logic, SimCity, SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, SimCity 4 then back to SimCity again... that's just crazy!
It's either SimCity 5 or SimCity 5000.
Have a little consistency people!
(not that is really matters, SimCity 5 was crappy anyway).


What's in a Name II ?

But there are exceptions where I can forgive a sequel for not carrying the burden of its ancestors name.

For instance, do you remember a game called ""Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars?""
Me neither and as such I'd be unlikely to show much interest in a title called ""Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars 2""
(Even typing a title as long of that makes me sad).

However a game I have been playing recently (and thoroughly enjoying) has been the snappily titled ""Rocket League"" which the Steam store page confidently tells me is the sequel to the previously mentioned (and ridiculously named) battle-cars game.

So as I said, had Rocket League been released as ""Blah, Blah, Blah-Blah Blah-Cars 2"" I'm convinced I would have avoided the title and missed out on a gem!

But thankfully it wasn't and I didn't so here we are now!


What's in a Name III ?

Rocket League is a deceptively simple arcade, car racing and football (or soccer to our American friends) mash-up.

As a side note, I've never understood why American Football is called ""Football"", they play the ball with their hands right? so is it called football because handball was already taken?
Also, because the label ""football"" is (rightly or wrongly) used for a game played with your hands it results in a sport which is actually played with foot and ball being called ""soccer"".... it's not important but it does boggle my little mind.

Anyway... back to Rocket League.


Simple Soccer

The Football part of the mash up is a simplified version of ""the beautiful game"".
Each match takes place in a caged stadium so there's no need to worry about the ball going out of play, there are no corners or throw-ins, no fouls or offside rules, it's ""soccer"" boiled down to its purest form.
As you'd expect, there's a goal at each end of the pitch and one giant ♥♥♥ ball (it's bigger than the cars!) that you need to knock around the field.

Each match only lasts for 5 minutes but with most of the interruptions that slow down a regular footy match removed it makes for a frantic, adrenaline fuelled 5 minutes of non-stop action.
There are different stadiums to choose from too, you can even pick up more by way of DLC to keep the background looking fresh if you feel the need.


The Drive to Win

The driving side of the mash-up is where Rocket League really shines.
Gone are the egoistical, under-educated but overpaid human players that ""show-boat"" around the pitch during a ""real"" football match, here we have cars, gorgeous, acrobatic  rocket powered cars!
Winning games will unlock a whole wealth of upgrades and adornments for your vehicle too.
There are hats, flags, wheels, decals, you can even change the colour of the smoke that spews out the back when you fire up your rockets and hurtle across the arena.

These  customisation options are a huge amount of fun and give your chosen vehicle an element of individuality when you're playing (and if you're as talentless as myself, losing) against your peers online.
Maybe those go faster stripes really will make a difference in the next match...   (I need all the help I can get!)


Ball Control

As a football simulation Rocket League is a great driving game.
The handling of the various vehicles is surprisingly good and complimented by a very intuitive set of controls.
You'll need to dust off your game pad to get the most out of Rocket League, but it's totally worth it!
It's rare that I play a game where the controls feel so dialled in and natural.
It doesn't take long before you're hitting the controls without thought to make the car jump, flip and spin on command, of course doing this in the right location to make the ball go where you want is another matter.

""Easy to learn, hard to master"" are six words that definitely apply to Rocket League.


Tyre-Ball

The game itself is fantastic to play,  you can choose between intimate 1v1 matches all the way up to the mayhem you'll experience in a chaotic 5v5 match.
With a little (or maybe a lot) of practice you'll find yourself sliding and skidding your vehicle into position to intercept, pass and shoot the ball.

It's a great feeling when you manage to pull off an impressive move (whether accidental or not) and leaping your car into the air to nudge a high flying ball into your opponents goal is soooo satisfying, especially in an online match when you've got a real audience to admire you car-ball prowess.

There's a tutorial and single player mode too which are both vital if you want to learn the ropes before you take your newly fledged ""tyre-ball"" talents online.
If I could give you some advice to avoid annoying others and embarrassing yourself when you first fire up Rocket League it would be this:

""Practice before you start playing online!""
(Hey, that's six words again, spooky!)


Hear Me Roar!

So we know the game plays well, but what are the aesthetics like?
Well, the arenas are all beautiful and provide a pretty backdrop which you'll probably hardly notice as you zoom around the pitch.

The vehicles themselves are bright and varied with some neat customisation options (although I'm sad to say that ""go-faster stripes"" did not make me a better player).

The sound is of a high standard too, from the roar of the engines to the roar of the crowd, the atmosphere created by the audio gives the game an energy and intensity which heightens the whole experience.

Rocket League looks and sounds great!
(yes, I'm doing the six words thing on purpose now.)


What's in a name IV ? 

But can I sum rocket league up in six words?
hmmm...

Well there are cars battling to win the ball, let's call them battle-cars, they're rocket powered, maybe even supersonic and they are definitely acrobatic....

Maybe something like

""Supersonic Rocket Powered Acrobatic Battle Cars...""

although that does sound familiar...
It'd be a great name for a game though...

Wouldn't it?


Final Whistle

Whatever you want to call it, Rocket League is a polished, intuitive and extremely addictive alternative sports title.
I'm having a blast with it!

But remember, if you do come and join the fun (and you should) and if you encounter a player online with an unprecedented lack of skill (and go-faster stripes), take it easy on them...

It might be me!

												Rocket League... I LOVE!

- Fast cars!
- Flying cars!
- Blowing people up!
- Ranked & Casual games!
- Completly destorying oppontants 15-0... also getting destroyed albiet not as pleasurable!
- Local Co-op (upto 4 players), multiple local player can also play against or with online players.
- Great replay features
- Spectator mode
- Very capable AI
- Not too bad community, most are friendly and respectful. Some are quite bitter!
- 5 min games keep you busy for HOURS! Literally! Time seems to fly playing this game.
- Offline season mode is... acceptable.
- Cant comment on DLC, dont own it.

The very worst thing to say to yourself when playing this game... ""ONE MORE!"""

												I remember back when I was a kid and got my first RC Car.
It was an epic moment that I'll never forget.
Now I can enjoy that exiting feeling combined with the sports
I like, football. The idea is genuine and the concept is 
well done and simple. Hit an ridiculous large ball with 
parts of your car to transport it into the oppenen's goal.
The physics giving a good feeling. You need a bit of time
to get the ball movement at start. The different cars to choose 
are only cosmetic besides the more or less ""hitbox"".
I think the fair environment is part of the big success.
No pay to win or other advantages. 
Matchmaking is most times quick .
One thing I would wish for is an option not to join already
running matches.
Afterall I would say that the game is worth the price.
I had hours of fun playing together with friends.
Who is looking for kind teammates can write on my wall
to request an invite for my new RL dedicated group
called ""Rocket League Fair Play""."

												This game is worth every cent spent! My first game ended with my own team scoring an own goal with 3 seconds to go to lose the game 5-6. Easy flow graphics, with smooth gameplay and rocketing FPS.

Would recommend to anyone, even if you've never played Football (Soccer) before.

												Rocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple, absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn’t need a ton of extra features around it. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle-kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just “one more match,” even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great, goofy, easy to learn and difficult to master action-sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds"

												This game should be the next E-Sport!

Who would have thought combining Football(soccer) with cars would be such fun? You can play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and even 4v4. The game has matchmaking, A.I. players, and even ranked matches so you can see how you match up with everyone else.

A unique feature is you can cross-play this with PS4 users who have the game. Future updates will expand upon this to allow you to create parties with your PC/PS4 friends.

Everyone out there seems to be playing this game, and with good reason.

You owe it to yourself to get this one and play with your friends, or make new ones!"

ConclusionRocket League is an amazing game. You know those games that you play while you should be going to bed? That's this game. Only 90 minutes into the game, and i've already had so much fun with it. I would honestly reccomend this game to anyone. Unless you REALLY hate soccer, and you simultaneously REALLY hate cars.

												When released, I marked the game as ""Not Interested"" almost instantly because I don't dig neither soccer nor racing games that much.

Then, I bought a Steam Controller when it became available through the Steam Store, thus, I received a copy of Rocket League (along Portal 2) but I didn't bothered at all and soon I forgot about.

One of my Steam friends noticed my Rocket League in his Steam Activity feed and asked me to install the game. I said NO.

The next day he asked me again to install the game. Again, I said NO. For the next two months or so he kept on asking me to install the game on a daily basis to no avail and I began to dislike the game even more because of that.

One night I had literaly nothing to do, so I decided to install Rocket League but not to give it a chance but for my friend to stop asking me to. After the brief tutorial I lost track of time and realised I had been playing for about two hours. At the same time, my friend bought a Four Pack and shared the copies with some of our friends; at the blink of an eye we were all hooked into the game.

In less than a week, 25 of us (and growing) already have the game and fell addicted harder than with heroin to the point of keep on playing for 7 continuous hours:

PROS:
- Addictive gameplay.
- Lots of fun.
- Easy to play.
- Keyboard n' mouse playable.
- Colorful visuals.
- Great music.
- Several game modes either online or local.
- Powered by Unreal Engine.

- Highly suggested to play with your friends.
- Lots of fun/sarcastic/senseless customizations.

CONS:
- Just a few stadiums to choose from.
- Most of the cars' aesthetics look like they were designed by a toddler.
- You can only choose from two team colors (orange or blue) when playing closed/private matches.
- DLC's are somewhat irrelevant unless you really wish those extra cars and soundtrack, otherwise, get the base game."

												Amazingly fun game that has all the fun elements of FIFA without the tedious bits.

If you've seen videos of Rocket League and think ""gee that would be hard to learn"" you're wrong and you're right. It's very easy to pick up but to pull off crazy aerials is hard and will take many, many hours to master.

The matchmaking service seems to work quite well and it's quick so if it does get things wrong and puts you in a game which is too easy or too hard it's not a big deal to look for another match.

Best to play with at least one friend so you can 2v2 others without having to deal with team mates dropping out or rage quitting.

I waited for it to be on sale but honestly it's worth full price. Hell I would happily have paid $50 for it. It's that fun."

												OverviewRocket League is a very popular, iconic multi-platform game that doesn't do much, but it gets by formidably with the few it has. Speaking as someone not interested in either cars nor football (Yes, football. The real one!), this game is incredibly addictive, and worthwhile if you have a few friends to play with.

The Pros:Incredibly Fun - Simple concept, easy to get the hang of but with a very high skill ceiling to keep you motivated in playing for a long time. Scoring some trick shot goals or plain luck bounces of the wall both fill the adrenaline in your soul. Winning is rewarding, and losing just makes you want a rematch.

Great Visuals - The level of detail is pretty decent, and cranking up the settings at maximum really gives it a nice feel in terms of visuals. The car models are very detailed, weather effects are decent, and praise the Gods for the adjustable FoV!

Customization - Playing unlocks car parts to customize your ride with. You can unlock several car bodies, paint types, wheels, hats (yes, TF2 style), exhaust particles and antennas. There are loads of possibilities and you can feel the car is truly yours. The only gripe I have with this is that you cannot save multiple ""load-outs"" and you cannot have a different setup based on team color. (Some accessories look godly on Red but awful on Blue and vice versa.)

Game Customization - You can host private matches with all sorts of modifiers, from gravity, to ball size, to boost speed, time and goal limits, anything! Go crazy and experiment!

Good Influx of Content - About once a month or two, new content is added. A new map here, a few more antennas there, a new game mode sprinkled once every season.  

The Cons:Unfair Input Method Balance - Unfortunately for us PC Purists out there, this game was designed for controllers. Specifically, the boost flying. Doing it on a keyboard is next to impractical, it is very unintuitive and hard to master. You can still play very well with a keyboard, but face against a team of controller users and you will be in for a bad time. The simplest fix that I CANNOT BELIEVE they didn't implement: The option to sort matchmaking for different input methods.

Horrendous Matchmaking - The system is mainly broken. If you play ranked, you will occasionally find yourself in a match with people 30 levels above you, because they play with a newbie friend that is unranked. It seems the game gives the team rating by calculating the average ranks of the members, and ignores Player level completely. So if players who are Veterans + but did not play ranked will be matched with anyone with their same rank.

Community is a bit Toxic - Not being PC or defensive, just a tad warning that you will get the (albeit maturer than) CoD attitude of ""lol newb get rekt"" from time to time.

Paid DLC-specific Achievements - There are new car DLCs to buy and fortunately they are purely cosmetic... but they decided to add achievements to them, so achievement hunters beware! You can't perfect this game without taking out your wallet because they decided it's a real challenge to ""Win an Online Match with this new Car!"".
ConclusionDespite the shortcomings, this game is incredibly fun. But do not purchase alone! Convince three friends to get it too and buy the 4-pack. Aside from better price, you will get a vastly superior experience when playing with people you know.

												The proof  that a game doesn't need to be mechanically complex to be compelling. Rocket Leauge is as simple as video games get. But it's tweaked and polished to perfection, making every moment all kill and no fill. And when the game is at it's best moments, whether it be the tense stand offs when all the players rush for the ball at kickoff or 30 seconds left on the clock with a tied scoreboard. It can be genuinely hard to put down. It harks back to simpler times, when video games didn’t need a billion bells and whistles to keep players interested. They just needed great design, and that’s exactly what you get with Rocket League. Soccer with cars. And it's beautiful."

I was at a party. A friend of mine got old and threw a party at his house. We played Rocket League at his party on his Playstation 4. I fell in love with the game. On my way back home, in the cab, I was thinking only about this awesome game. As soon as I reached home, I opened steam (it was 5 in the morning), bought it and played it till 8 AM. It was THAT GOOD! 
One of the best experiences in gaming is called Rocket League. 10/10

												Fast-paced game where cars play football carball. A great concept backed up by its great gameplay!

Everything on this game is just spot on; The steering, the map sizes, the game lenghts, where the boosts are placed at...
This game has also alot content to unlock. There are no real advantanges what car you are using, except some cars have a bit tinier or larger hit box. I honestly like this, because I can use the car for the looks and not for the advantage.

No matter if you play mostly FPS games, MOBA, mmorpg etc. this game will be perfect for you. I can honestly recommend this game for EVERYONE. I am pretty sure that I will spend hundreds of hours on this game.
Buy this game, you wont regret it."

Game Review
""Lets play some Carball!""

Rocket League is a game which combines soccer and reckless driving. It is a sequel to the game SARPBC, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars and it is produced by Psyonix. It includes cross-platform play between PS4 and PC, having an huge playerbase currently.

Gameplay

You will have lots of fun with this game guaranteed! The controls are ultra-simple to use, you will get used to them in a blink of an eye. I play the game with a controller, which for me it is the best way to play it, but it is enjoyable to play with the keyboard + mouse too. The game itself is ultra fun! The ball physics with the rebounds and all feel impressively well, as the cars handling. It is incredibly easy to play, yet extremely difficult to master. You also have to use strategy in this game in order to win the matches, much like regular soccer. If you are just a ball chaser you will have difficult times winning, you have to think about your positioning and timing very well. You can also do incredible trick shots and jump shots due to your boost, which are incredible hard to master, but after some time you will start to get the hang of it. The worst part are some camera angles and the bots AI, but unless you plan on only playing offline games, the AI wont be much of a problem. It feels so good to make some incredible plays, even when you fail you will have tons of laughs. It is a very simple game with simple ideas, yet they work perfectly and make this game a blast to play for both casual and professional players.

Longevity

The longevity of a game which relies on an multiplayer-focused game can be debatable, but in this one I am sure you will spend enough hours to compensate the money you spend in the game. At the moment I have spent 35 hours and intend to spend many more. You have tons of cars, paint jobs, hats and other customization stuff to unlock during the game that will keep you entertained for the first hours (I unlocked everything in around 20 hours). You also have 4 different game-modes (1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4) which give some good diversity since each one of the modes has its own strategies to follow in order to win them. You also have an offline season mode available to play, but it is kind of boring in my opinion given the multiplayer options you have. Practice mode is also available, a great place to tune your skills up. The ranks and leaderboards system will also entertain you, it is great to climb up against your friends in the diverse list of leaderboards available.

Graphics and Presentation

Only have good things to say here too. By the moment you enter the game you will know you are in for something special. Slick menus with an ultra easy interface plus amazing songs will make you excited right at the first time you open the game. You got plenty of voice commands to use in-game which is definitely a plus presentation wise. Now the graphics. Another win in this spectacular game. Great graphics for a game this simple. All works really well, the colors, grass, car details, everything looks great. The level of detail in the cars and their customization objects is great too. These are some impressive visuals, even though the main focus of the game is definitely not the graphics.

Music and Sounds

The soundtrack in this game is amazing. I was totally not expecting it, there are really some great songs in it, got some of them stuck in my head. There are only around eleven songs in it, but most are awesome and don't get old. The various sounds in the game are also great, from the sounds of the different boost types, ball hits, drifts, crashes, everything works really well.

Multiplayer

This is the big deal in this game. And oh boy, how fun it is to play it with or against friends. You will have tons of fun making the best goals ever as well as the biggest fails in history. It really gives you tons of laughs. You have also the option to play ranked instead of casual games, which make for some more intense, fun matches! The playerbase is huge, around 100000 players are online in most of the time, so you will find games in a matter of seconds. The community is in it´s majority very friendly, but like in all multiplayer games, you will find some toxic people playing the game too. You also have different server regions to choose from so you can play without worrying about lag. Unfortunately I did have some crazy lags in some european servers. It is rare to find a laggy server but it happens and can get very frustrating, specially when you are playing ranked. Yet, I am sure the devs will fix most of the server issues soon, so no worries about that.

Summary
Pros:
Newcomer-friendly gameplay, yet difficult to master
Great controls
Amazing soundtrack
Great graphics and presentation
Amazing multiplayer with lots of fast-paced, intense matches
Cons:
The Bots AI is pretty weak
Some connection issues in multiplayer
My personal score: 9.0/10

If you enjoy high octane reckless driving and the world's most popular sport, Rocket League is for you. It is one of the most fun multiplayer games released in the last years. The base price is great value for the game you get, which will get you hours and hours of great fun! Embrace the latest gaming trend in Steam and PS4 and have a blast playing this soccer-meets-cars gem!"

												This one is a masterpiece, shining like a diamond in my Steam Collection. Soccer with cars? Why not! The learning curve presented here is one of the greatest I've seen in years, both rewarding and satisfying. You can actually feel and see how much better you're becoming after every single hour spent in Rocket League. Developers are pushing updates and fixes every single month, often surprising us with completely new game modes like Rumble and Hoops. Wanna hear more? All updates are free of charge! DLC's are not ""PayToWin"" contest offering small visual enhancements instead.

tl;dr BEST. GAME. EVER.

												Rocket League is a game that is best played with a group of friends. There is just something about a team gelling so well that you can dominate another with relative ease. Although competitive, it is a fantastic game to just sit back and relax with. This is especially true when using a controller.

The customisation options for the vehicles in this game are plentiful and really allow the player to stand out. Although, a small minor update to allow the painting of the wheels would be nice...

A vast selection of options for private matches are available to change, meaning you can create some rather interesting matches at times.

Overall, the game is great and can easily be played by almost anyone with 5 minutes of free time."

If you like racing games and Soccer you will have a lot of fun in that game.

Jump, shoot goals, try to keep the ball away from your goal or just dont try to do an owen goal xD

												This game is so simple yet so fun. I cannot explain it, but it's highly addictive. I mean, driving small cars and playing soccer with the oversized ball? Sounds stupid. But actually it's dynamic, tense and fun, especially in online play. 

You can unlock cars, decals, tires, painjobs, stuff like that, you can also play training, exibition, seasons and of course multiplayer. I have it on both PC and PS4 and I have to say, it's much easier to play with controller than keyboard. 

Anyway, yes, I would recommend this because it's pure fun!

												Rocket League is a vehicle based football game developed by Psyonix. In Rocket League you get behind the wheel of one of a number of different cars and face off against up to 4 opponents in an effort to hit a giant football in to the opposing team's goal. Enjoyable in solo play, local multiplayer and online matchmaking you can either play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 and even unbalanced matches! (only available in offline exhibition mode).

+Great graphics and visual effects
+A wide range of customisation options unlocked as you complete matches
+There's a season mode if you wish to play solo so you don't have to just play exhibition games repeatedly, the season mode is actually pretty good and features a number of different options which make it more interesting
+Local multiplayer supports up to four players (providing you have enough controllers)
+A number of different maps, each with several time and weather variations
+Cross-platform multiplayer with PS4 players (though the party system currently doesn't work when doing cross-platform matches)
+Rocket League features some quick messages which get assigned to your controller's hat switch allowing you to communicate quickly with your teammates
+You can save the replays of your matches to watch back later
+Obviously it has full controller support for 360 controllers as well as Xbox One controllers and the controls are fantastic
+It's even entertaining for those of us who aren't keen on playing sports games
+Your car's top speed is considerably higher on a pitch made of tarmac compared to a grass pitch, it's not a major feature but it's certainly a nice touch
+As mentioned earlier you can play unbalanced matches when playing offline exhibition, they provide and extra layer of challenge and are great fun when playing local multiplayer

+/-The game's bots aren't great but this game is best enjoyed by playing multiplayer anyway

-Solo play gets pretty repetitive

Verdict:
An Essential Purchase (9.5/10)

Rocket League is an incredibly good multiplayer game with great visuals, lots of customisation options and a number of different maps. If you're looking for a new multiplayer game or just something a bit different, you've come to the right place.

No drama, Just Reviews.

Game Review
""Lets play some Carball!""

Rocket League is a game which combines soccer and reckless driving. It is a sequel to the game SARPBC, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars and it is produced by Psyonix. It includes cross-platform play between PS4 and PC, having an huge playerbase currently.

Gameplay

You will have lots of fun with this game guaranteed! The controls are ultra-simple to use, you will get used to them in a blink of an eye. I play the game with a controller, which for me it is the best way to play it, but it is enjoyable to play with the keyboard + mouse too. The game itself is ultra fun! The ball physics with the rebounds and all feel impressively well, as the cars handling. It is incredibly easy to play, yet extremely difficult to master. You also have to use strategy in this game in order to win the matches, much like regular soccer. If you are just a ball chaser you will have difficult times winning, you have to think about your positioning and timing very well. You can also do incredible trick shots and jump shots due to your boost, which are incredible hard to master, but after some time you will start to get the hang of it. The worst part are some camera angles and the bots AI, but unless you plan on only playing offline games, the AI wont be much of a problem. It feels so good to make some incredible plays, even when you fail you will have tons of laughs. It is a very simple game with simple ideas, yet they work perfectly and make this game a blast to play for both casual and professional players.

Longevity

The longevity of a game which relies on an multiplayer-focused game can be debatable, but in this one I am sure you will spend enough hours to compensate the money you spend in the game. At the moment I have spent 35 hours and intend to spend many more. You have tons of cars, paint jobs, hats and other customization stuff to unlock during the game that will keep you entertained for the first hours (I unlocked everything in around 20 hours). You also have 4 different game-modes (1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4) which give some good diversity since each one of the modes has its own strategies to follow in order to win them. You also have an offline season mode available to play, but it is kind of boring in my opinion given the multiplayer options you have. Practice mode is also available, a great place to tune your skills up. The ranks and leaderboards system will also entertain you, it is great to climb up against your friends in the diverse list of leaderboards available.

Graphics and Presentation

Only have good things to say here too. By the moment you enter the game you will know you are in for something special. Slick menus with an ultra easy interface plus amazing songs will make you excited right at the first time you open the game. You got plenty of voice commands to use in-game which is definitely a plus presentation wise. Now the graphics. Another win in this spectacular game. Great graphics for a game this simple. All works really well, the colors, grass, car details, everything looks great. The level of detail in the cars and their customization objects is great too. These are some impressive visuals, even though the main focus of the game is definitely not the graphics.

Music and Sounds

The soundtrack in this game is amazing. I was totally not expecting it, there are really some great songs in it, got some of them stuck in my head. There are only around eleven songs in it, but most are awesome and don't get old. The various sounds in the game are also great, from the sounds of the different boost types, ball hits, drifts, crashes, everything works really well.

Multiplayer

This is the big deal in this game. And oh boy, how fun it is to play it with or against friends. You will have tons of fun making the best goals ever as well as the biggest fails in history. It really gives you tons of laughs. You have also the option to play ranked instead of casual games, which make for some more intense, fun matches! The playerbase is huge, around 100000 players are online in most of the time, so you will find games in a matter of seconds. The community is in it´s majority very friendly, but like in all multiplayer games, you will find some toxic people playing the game too. You also have different server regions to choose from so you can play without worrying about lag. Unfortunately I did have some crazy lags in some european servers. It is rare to find a laggy server but it happens and can get very frustrating, specially when you are playing ranked. Yet, I am sure the devs will fix most of the server issues soon, so no worries about that.

Summary
Pros:
Newcomer-friendly gameplay, yet difficult to master
Great controls
Amazing soundtrack
Great graphics and presentation
Amazing multiplayer with lots of fast-paced, intense matches
Cons:
The Bots AI is pretty weak
Some connection issues in multiplayer
My personal score: 9.0/10

If you enjoy high octane reckless driving and the world's most popular sport, Rocket League is for you. It is one of the most fun multiplayer games released in the last years. The base price is great value for the game you get, which will get you hours and hours of great fun! Embrace the latest gaming trend in Steam and PS4 and have a blast playing this soccer-meets-cars gem!"

TL:DR
A rather unique idea of cars and football (or soccer) together to create one of the best competitive games ever made. If you're someone like me, who doesn't like cars or football, you may be put off by this at first, but it's definitely not what it seems, it's no wonder it's so popular. Definitely worth it!

Now for the full review

Rocket League is a game where you drive around in a rocket powered car trying to score goals. Sounds boring doesn't it? It really isn't. Rocket League suprised me. It's not one of those generic sports games I was anticipating it to be. It's a really addicting and competitive game. The game is highly physics based, meaning you'll see cars jumping and flying around. Realistic!

Your team can have up to at least 4 players, with matches lasting five minutes. The goal is basically what you do in football/soccer, score goals. The team with the most goals wins. This can be a challenge sometimes as it does require team-work, unless it's 1 v 1. There definitely isn't a shortage of players, with thousands of players on Steam AND it's cross platform capability with players from the PS4, which isn't really seen that much in games. Finding a game shouldn't be too difficult either, the matchmaking system's perfect.

The game highly advises you to use a controller, except when I started playing, my controller stopped working, so I resorted to using the keyboard. Honestly, it wasn't that hard for me to adapt. It does take time, for some people, but after that the controls become pretty simple, though I would still recommend using a controller, as there are plenty of people who struggle with the keyboard and mouse.

The game isn't just multiplayer, there is a single player and a co-op mode. In single player, you are able to access a mode called Season. This puts you with your own unique team, and places you in a tournament against bots. I haven't really played much of it but it seemed pretty simple. If you want the most out of your money I would stick to the multiplayer as it's much more entertaining and challenging.

There are quite a few different maps in Rocket League. Each one looks amazing and colourful, with quite a bit of background detail which isn't a suprise due to it being made on Unreal Engine 3. Despite all the activity going on in the match, performance was never an issue. This game runs rather smooth for what it is. 

There are different types of cars, all of which are fully customizable, ranging from colours to patterns to wheels etc. You can unlock these different customizations from completing matches. Not to mention, there's plenty of dlc that add different cars and customization items, that have quite reasonable price tags.

Rocket League is one of those games where you can loose track of time playing it, and I'm glad I replayed it after months of it sitting around in my library. It's highly addicting and I can see why it's so popular. It also has such an amazing soundtrack that plays in the background of the main menu, with some really memorable songs. If you have spare money, I'd definitely say this is worth it, a near flawless game. The DLC seems quite reasonable as well.

Pros- Highly addicting
- Amazing detail
- Highly customizable
- Great performance
- Amazing soundtrack

Cons- Problems with keyboard controls

												Probably one of the most fun and addictive game that came out in a long, long time. Very simple game, fun mechanics and lots of depth for advanced players. Add your friends to the mix and you got some really good stuff.

EDIT BELOW:

The greatest game ever just gets better. Psyonix has really just listened to the community over and over and over and provided/fixed/added pretty much all we've wanted thus far.

I just can't get enough of this game, it's been a blast and still is and I don't see myself stopping any time soon. Their support for the game as well as the crate funded tournaments will be sure to keep this game going for years to come and I, for one, cannot wait to see what they add next.

A game made even better when you play with friends both online or offline."

												Amazing game.

This game is so dynamic and energetic, not a second is spent bored. Non stop action with your team, always edging to get the game deciding nudge, whether it be defense or attack. You spend hours, upon hours, getting addicted and mastering your skills. 

This game will make it to the massive multiplayer leagues. Rocket League will improve once they get proper class ranks, gained through playing ranked matches. 

Rocket League also features in depth customisation, allowing the user to ultimately customise their vehicle. This allows uniqueness, and a great ton of laughter.

Graphics of this game is amazing. If your computer isn't the best then you'll have to turn down the graphics a little, but your PC doesn't need to be expensive to play the game on great graphics. Decent laptops can even play this game decently.

This game is honestly a 9/10. Rocket League has the graphics, the dynamic energetic gameplay, the competitive experience in multiplayer and more."

												I´ve played a lot of games over the years, from MMO´s to indies to god knows what.

However never have a first impression of a game been this good. 

I sat down with 2 friends and played this game for the first time with a xbox controller and within 5-10 mins i had the best laugh i´ve had for a long time.

The game is easy to pickup and easy to learn but diffenetly something you should play with friends, the sheer joy of in fact lining up that perfect goal or getting it is a great feeling of something silly and stupid that will make you scream the ears of all your friends and wake up whoever else lives in the house.

This game is a perfect balance between silly, stupid and genius really, the music, the gameplay and the easy way of learning makes it sooo addictive that it is really just a must have for anyone who likes to have a great laugh with friends and just wanna forget everything else for a few hours.

I´m for sure gonna play this even more over the next long time as my car needs some swag ^_^"

												Cars playing soccer/football
But wait! There is more:
Even though on the first look this game's concept appears simple and goofy, the depth of gameplay found here is insanely high. Rocket League is one of those games which allow you to do amazing plays and moves if you dedicated time and effort into it, but at the same time provide a lot of fun while played casually with friends.


What to expect
This game is the sequel to the PS3 game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars from 2008. Therefore the game idea isn't new and the gameplay doesn't differ a lot. But since the same developer Psyonix stay behind Rocket League, their experience allowed them to address problems and improve the game (as well as shorten the name :P).

Rocket League provides fast 5 minute rounds inside a box-shaped arena. The edges of the arena are curved to allow players to drive up walls and even on the ceiling. The team size can range from one to four players on each team.

The gameplay is fast and because of the playingfield's small size goals can be scored from the other side of it, since there are no obstacles in the way other than a potentional defending player. Blocking the ball and doing a counterattack right afterwards happens within seconds and can turn an entire game.


The cars
There are multiple car models to choose from, but their handling or top speed does not differ. Only the hitbox of the cars are slighly different - which creates some tiny variation in the ball interaction. However the main purpose of having multiple cars is to customize it without interfering or imbalancing the gameplay. This works very well and choosing a car is a personal preference rather than a statistical battle to determine which car is the best. The car customization comes with color, surface type, additional decal, wheels, antenna, goofy hats and particles for the rocket trail.

""Rocket trail?"" you may ask. Well, in Rocket League every car has a Rocket Engine attached to its back allowing to boost itself to greater speed. The best part is that you can jump and shoot yourself into the air with it and being able to fly. This creates gameplay in all three dimensions. Instead of just dribbling the ball on the ground, you can launch yourself into the air and hit the ball before your enemy can. It is not easy and adds a decent learning-curve to the game.


The experience
The game is very polished. The options menu allows key rebinding serparatly for keyboard and controller, very in-depth adjustments to the camera position/behaviour as well as a large choice of grafic options for the Unreal Engine 3.
Textures are very detailed, particle effects very well made. The grass on the ground is fantastically animated. Even though the arena/stadiums are the same, there are four different theme versions, ranging from a raining indoor park to a full blown stadium with thousand of people cheering.

The cars handle very well, can turn fast and stick to the ground unless you want and tell them to drift. Once airborne keeping the control of the car or wanting to do what you want is difficult but not impossible. The physic engine of the game does it's work very well. The ball itself is predictable and doesn't behave random at all.

You unlock new parts for your car customization after completing each game - no matter the outcome of the match. The account progress is ok, but nothing incredible or important. This game shines when it comes to it's gameplay.

The sound effects as well as grafical effects while playing or just driving around are incredible enjoyable. Boosting to full speed makes you feel powerful, ramming people and even destroying them creates satisfing explosions. And when scoring a goal the ball explodes and creates a shockwave on which you can ride on with your rocket launcher. Directly afterwards you get a replay of the goal in slow motion. At the end of the game you can save a replay of the entire game and watch it whenever you want.
Setting up goals and blocking the ball also feel rewarding by the system and on a team-spirit basis.

Since the game has high skill ceiling, experienced players can crush any other ones. The matchmaking system works very well in that regard, that you get matched up with equally good players and even indicates if it doesnt find them and slowly extends it's skill range in order to find players as fast as possible. You can group up to play together in normal and ranked games.
You also have the choice of selecting multiple regional servers such as Europe, Oceanic, West- and East-America, as well as queueing up for multiple modes (e.g. 1vs1 and 3v3) at the same time. The game will put you in the first fitting game it can find for you.

The game also provides a singleplayer campaign against the AI, as well as tutorials and training for various parts of the game such as defending the goal and scoring goals. For those who just want to get used to the controls or test can hop into the sandbox mode.
I also like to mention that you can queue up for an online game from any menu or singleplayer gamemode. So while searching you can play around in sandbox mode.


Downloadable Content (Supersonic Fury DLC Update)
As announced by Psyonix, the first major update hit Rocket League. I first was disappointed that they want to go the DLC route. Not because i dont like to pay for content, but more because of the bad reputation the word 'DLC' has nowadays, fearing that Rocket League gets looked down for doing this markt strategie. But my fear should vanish.

The first DLC just includes two new car and customization items for a small price. The real update includes free stuff for everyone. New map, new specator mode, better ranked play, improved main menu background, and so on. With the new update the 20€ i pay for the game are even more worth it. And Psyonix plans are to keep going, maybe even into the direction of modding and crazy maps.

So yes. I am excited for every upcomming Update and DLC.


Conclusion
I recommend this game to everyone. May it be casual players, those who play in a group to have fun together as well as the ones who like play competitively. Playing this game has the perfect fun/frustration balance and great learning curve."

												WOOOOO! Buy this game! NOW! What are you waiting for?? Screw a sale! it's $20! So very worth it!

I don't normally use an exclamation point after every sentence, but in this case, I WILL!!!

Thank you Angry Joe! So glad I follow all of his episodes at times like this! :D

Original and ridiculously fun. Just the fact that it's original says a lot. Trying to be original these days is basically impossible, but here it is, in all its glory.

Cars + Soccer = I didn't realize I liked soccer till now!

9/10 - RECOMMENDED!

												The first game I've bought on steam and it was so worth it.
It's a game with a good, steep skill curve to climb as well as a nice, new and upcoming community for Indians (in particular).
Play with your friends over a big screen and enjoy boosting around, demolishing players, flying around, flailing about the ball.
Hand the controller over to someone and watch them amazed as they climb up the walls, score a goal for the first time. 
Super fun and addictive. A must buy.

P.S. I think to climb the skill curve, a controller is necessary."

												Rocket League is one of those games that pop up every once in awhile and make a statement and a change. The simplicity of the game which the eye first meets, to the fine complexity of the game that is not first seen but learned through experience is what makes the game so great. When you first start out you may not realize you can even double jump or fly, yet the game is still so fun. Then you spend some time playing your judgement gets better and you learn to make moves effectively in order to be competitive. You then notice there is training and so on and so forth you start changing camera settings and button layouts so you can be as effective as possible. This game has so many layers to it. Iv noticed there's a really steep learning curve to this game and then you plateau for awhile. Then you kind of step your way up and up as you then notice you have a few hundred hours into the game and your still not bored. Iv never seen a game that can keep me so addicted to and yet it's such a simple idea. What makes it great to me is how there is no aid in shooting or blocking it's your rocket car against physics and gravity with your car as the force to change its directing. It is so satisfying to score a game winning goal or the game winning save for your team. Once you start playing with friends and communicating you realize how serious it gets. I can't think of anything that's bad about this game the work they are doing is great and now Xbox one is coming into the cross play making it one of if not the first games to allow PC, PS4, and XBOX ONE to play together. If you have not bought this game and I was one who looked over it a few times but still had it on the back of my mind it was one of those, oh if I have an extra $20 I'll buy it. NOOO if you have the money I don't care what your plan was with that $50 steam card this game is a must have and I'm sure every single rocket league player can say the same thing there's much more than to what meets the eye."

												Rocket League;

In this little gem of a game you're in control of a car...these cars have rocket boosters on the back of them. Your goal is to play soccer/football. You can do 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or even 4v4. There is also a ranking system if you're the competitive type. The matches are usually quick which makes it really easy to get addicted to this game meaning you'll be hitting play again over and over. The average match length is 5-7 minutes. (Could be longer if you go into overtime) In those few minutes you and your teammates need to try to score as many goals as you possibly can while trying to keep the other team from scoring. Another great thing about this game is that the cars that you use to play are customizable. You unlock flags, hats, wheels, body styles, paint and all sorts of other things to make your car the way you want. There is ALWAYS people playing so you definitely don't have to worry about not having people to play with. It is cross-platform which means you're also up against people on PS4. Honestly I would recommend playing with an Xbox controller if you have one (its easier for me personally) Most of the time on average there's about 50-60,000 people online at any given time.

Since the first time I wrote this review there has been a few DLC added to Steam for purchase for this game. They're definitely worth it, along with Rocket League itself. Make sure to pick up this game for you and your friends, you won't regret it.

Pros:
-Quick Games
-Amazing Graphics (Your potato can run it at max settings)
-Customization
-Steep Learning Curve

Cons:
-You'll Be Playing With Balls....Tons and Tons of Balls. ;)
-Keyboard Controls Take a While to Get Used to

Final Verdict;

10/10"

												I've been playing this game non-stop since I found it on Twitch. It's a game that's easy to learn but hard to master. You will find countless funny plays but if you want to take the game to the next level you will see it's very skill based. I still play this game every day and for me it's very addicting. If you're wondering whether you want to buy it or not, check out some videos of noobs and pro's to see the difference for yourself. But don't forget, your own experience is always the best."

												Football With Cars

This game I have enjoyed over 700 hours on...

Great fun and a fantastic game for trading.

You can buy DLC, trade items, play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 modes. Even hockey and basketball make it into this game. You got so many options to play with it's great. Freestyle goals, funny goals, stunts, saves etc.

So many great memories can be had from this game.

However it's not flawless, one thing you need to be careful of, is scamming.

You are your own guard for scams. Read a guide on how to avoid scammers, as the items in this game are worth alot. Some items worth around £500. Anyone can be a scammer so watch yourself. 

Toxic people are a problem, this game has over 25 million players, alot are toxic, alot are scammers, alot are rage quiters etc. You want to avoid a toxic player? Simple solution. ""Mute"" them when things go south. Done, no more cursing, swearing etc. All with the click of a button.

All in all, this game I would recommend."

												I was recommended this game after offhandedly mentioning it to a friend, and it ended up being one of my favourite games of the year.  Where to start? It's multiplayer focused football with cars. Some people seem to dismiss it as a simple game that will get boring fast, but I would disagree. The game's core mechanics are so well polished that playing feels fluid and natural from the get-go, especially if you play racing games. The car handling is very simple, nothing like the likes of GRID or GTA IV. I think this handling system is good for the game, complex handling mechanics (gear systems, realistic turning, etc) would probably hamper the experience, when the game can be very fast paced and precision heavy at times. At higher levels of play you will use your boost to fly through the air, tilting your car to direct it towards the ball in mid-air. This requires practice and precision, and is very satisfying when executed correctly. This game has a high skill ceiling in that regard, where goals and saves can be pulled off, and the difficulty of them can skyrocket depending on the situation.

The multiplayer is good, there are dedicated servers, in fact ONLY dedicated servers, which is something I've never really come to think about. The game modes range from 4v4, 3v3, 2v2 to 1v1. All are different in how they are played, but 3v3 is the mode I play the most and the mode that is considered ""standard"" in the game. In 3v3 you can learn about player rotation on the pitch, defensive roles, attacking roles and backup roles. Look these up on the steam guides if you are curious. The servers are split into casual and ranked games, where casual games do not impact your MMR or ""elo"" but do give you EXP and affect your all-time stats, and ranked games will impact your ranked points and MMR as well as your all-time stats. The ranked system uses points to monitor progress, starting at around 200, and you gain points on victory and lose them when you lose a match. I play this game alone mostly, and an issue I have with casual games were teamstacking in 3v3 games, where I would be matched against 3 players who were all friends, and the games would be fairly one-sided from having to play against a team that most likely communicated their play amongst themsleves. Since switching to ranked games I have not felt the urge to go back, there is even a mode called ""Solo Standard"" which is exclusively for single players looking to play 3v3 without the worries of facing a coordinated team.

Teamplay is a large part of rocket league, all modes except 1v1 require coordination to be played well, perhaps with the exception of 4v4 mode appropriately named ""Chaos"" where there are so many cars that strategy and balance dips from having too many cars on the pitch at once. You will have to learn simple things like proper round start etiquitte, player rotation, setting up passes, scoring goals from passes, scoring aerials, outmaneuvering the opponent, and so on. The community is a mixed bag, sometimes you will encounter jerks who spam chat-commands ironically, sometimes you will have a pleasant game full of sportsmanlike players. So not that different from most other communities, I'd say. You can even turn text chat off if you want to.

Overall I can say that this game is one of my favourite games of the year, and I will continue to play it... indefinetely? Maybe."

I was at a party. A friend of mine got old and threw a party at his house. We played Rocket League at his party on his Playstation 4. I fell in love with the game. On my way back home, in the cab, I was thinking only about this awesome game. As soon as I reached home, I opened steam (it was 5 in the morning), bought it and played it till 8 AM. It was THAT GOOD! 
One of the best experiences in gaming is called Rocket League. 10/10

												You have to play this to understand the appeal - watching the trailer does not do it justice.

This is a no-brainer, so I will keep it short. Rocket League is so over-the-top utterly addicting and blood-pumping insane, that its really hard to come up with anything negative about it. Its soccer/football with jacked-up racecars. 

Pros:
+Graphics are crisp and just overall amazing
+Controls are intuitive
+Amazing amount of content
+Overall the whole thing is super well done
+Playing online is so simple, and the score system and leaderboards are perfectly created
+They even threw in four player local splitscreen 
+There are nearly 150,000 players on at any given time
+Complete car customization, and you earn new parts and stuff all the time

Cons:
-Twenty bones sounds expensive until you try it ;)

My god buy this already."

												This game is without any doubts one of my favorite games ever played, I'm playing it since it was released and I enjoyed every second of it with my friends but in the last few months competitive mode has been completely ruined, probably by the last patch. As soon as you play private games with your friends this game is pure FUN for hours, but if you ever want to take a break like trying a 1v1 competitive match, your fun will end there. In the first match, if you are veteran, probably you will find a semi-pro that you will just overwhelm 3-0 after 10 seconds and he will forfeit. In the second match (talking as a veteran) you will surely find a legend or so with at least 400+ hours than you and of course you'll never be able to win.
This game just needs improvements on the matchmaking, then it will be just perfect, but as it is now I can't recommend it to everyone."

												Rocket League is a game by the studio that made the free-to-play game Nosgoth that punches far above its weight. It is easy to learn, with a pair of tutorials that can be completed in under ten minutes and is almost immediately fun. However, the addiction starts to set in when you push yourself to start mastering the game.

Your first few matches will feel chaotic and hinging entirely on chance. As you acclimate to the controls and physics, you become more confident within the game world and find yourself capable of intentionally performing maneuvers. That becomes a turning point in the game and as you perfect these skills, there comes an incredible elation when you line a shot up -- probably with an assist from another driver -- and nail that in. All with determined calculation, rather than random luck.

The modes and arenas have minor variants, but are consistent. It quickly becomes a game pitting carthletes against each other and nothing else. True tests of skill and reflex. There aren't really even any modifications that impact skill, either. All the adding trappings you unlock are cosmetic. The game has ranked and unranked multiplayer of different team sizes and single player with a season/tournament campaign. That's it. That's all it needs.

My only negative experience has been with AI/Bots. They are uncannily talented and whether they're on your team or the opposition, they can ruin the game. When you are the only human on your team, there's no joy in absolutely trouncing the other team, because you know it's because of the unfair advantage the bots provided you. Perhaps this is better in the Ranked league, but in general play, there are a lot of people who just drop out, midgame. I do not know if these are occurring because of network issues in this overwhelmingly popular (and therefore still trying to ramp up server and network capacity) game or if they're just poor sports. Either way, having bots substitute is frustrating -- and they don't seem to do match-making for in-progress games, to substitute slots with real players.

Back to the positives though -- and this is a big one. You will almost immediately be in awe at how glitzy and shiny the world looks. The game has a great art style and fantastic presentation. Slick and not quite realistic, but very high quality. And the world is smooth. High framerate with, in my experience, absolutely no hitching or lagging or anything else. The game is smooth as silk.

I find this a surprise, because it seems like a game that by all rights should be a bit janky. It should come with caveats and ""for the price point"" justifications. It doesn't, though. It's an excellent experience that feels well-crafted. It sets a framework for itself and stays within it, polishing what it does well rather than expanding endlessly upon it, poorly.

If the trailer and live streams make this game seem appealing to you, I'd advice picking it up even at the $20 USD price. As long as the playerbase is still there when there is a big sale, that sale is going to be a no-brainer. If this game is found for $10 USD over the next few months, through the holidays -- it is going to be a downright steal. There is so much fun to be had here. Even more so, if you have a couple friends to build a team with.

This is a total gem that I have no reservations about recommending.

If you want to see some gameplay starting from the first time the game is launched, the following is a six hour live stream of Rocket League (begins about 5m into the video):

												Friend gifted me this game and got it for himself too.

Simple, cute & fun football game.
It's more difficult than you think if you just watch streamers playing it.
There's so many friendly players in the game too (◕ω◕)

This is the game where you said 1 more round and end up playing whole day

												When released, I marked the game as ""Not Interested"" almost instantly because I don't dig neither soccer nor racing games that much.

Then, I bought a Steam Controller when it became available through the Steam Store, thus, I received a copy of Rocket League (along Portal 2) but I didn't bothered at all and soon I forgot about.

One of my Steam friends noticed my Rocket League in his Steam Activity feed and asked me to install the game. I said NO.

The next day he asked me again to install the game. Again, I said NO. For the next two months or so he kept on asking me to install the game on a daily basis to no avail and I began to dislike the game even more because of that.

One night I had literaly nothing to do, so I decided to install Rocket League but not to give it a chance but for my friend to stop asking me to. After the brief tutorial I lost track of time and realised I had been playing for about two hours. At the same time, my friend bought a Four Pack and shared the copies with some of our friends; at the blink of an eye we were all hooked into the game.

In less than a week, 25 of us (and growing) already have the game and fell addicted harder than with heroin to the point of keep on playing for 7 continuous hours:

- Keyboard n' mouse playable.
- Colorful visuals.

- DLC's are somewhat irrelevant unless you really wish those extra cars and soundtrack, otherwise, get the base game."

												Rocket League;
The only game where you can 
Be a girl and scream like a dude when hitting a pole
Make goals frequantly while doing backflips
Making back and front flips
Scream your lungs out
Laugh even though you cry in the inside for missing the goal
Get assist for not doing anything

And last of all;
You are a flying battlepowered car who can has a rainbow boost...

Its fun with a lot of friends. When playing alone it gets boring. Achievements and products are easily gotten though."

												Car soccer.. 

What a time to be alive.

It's a fantastic game. It's such a unique experience, and it's unfortunate that I never really took the time to play SARPBC. Apart from any game I have owned, it is a competitive multi-platform sports game that you will have copious amounts of fun playing -- Whether you're on the winning OR losing team.

This game has seen a lot of negative feedback lately due to the crate system being introduced. Personally, I never really liked the idea of it, but do keep in mind, there is absolutely no Steam Community Market involved.

Keys to unlock crates are $1.49, and the crates seem to drop fairly often. If nothing else, it's an OK way to fund further development of the game and increase prize pools for RLCS.
Those of you that are just SO upset with Psyonix about crates, and threaten to uninstall-
C'mon. We really got the best flavor of sh*t sandwich here, if sh*t has to be eaten.
The animated decals and wheels are pretty darn sweet.

Warning to all:
Parts of the community and certain individuals that you will meet can be VERY toxic and degrading in online matches.
That's pretty much the internet for you, but I feel that it stems from something more specific;
A lot of CS:GO diehards play this on the side with their clanmates, and that kind of vindictive and immature mentality leaks in to this game due to the competitive nature.

In closing..

Bring some friends, keep your ballchasing to a minimum, and dive in to this game.
Prepare for a wild learning curve and a boatload of fun."

												A fun and refreshing soccer gameAlthough this game is not the first time where cars and soccer have been put into the same game, this is a refreshing game to many that feels like something new. It is a game with a simple concept, it is loads of fun as so many things can happen in a match that makes it exciting every time, such as an epic save or goal. Playing with friends is definitely recommended as i find its the way to play that i found brings the most fun, but if you solo queue it is still exciting. The controls in the game are simple to use and playing with a keyboard is very doable. This game is definitely worth the price and will bring many hours of fun!"

												I received Rocket League from a friend who swore by it that it was fun and addicting. 
Following that, I proceeded to play with him and some other friends; but we sucked...bad.

700+ logged hours later....

I am in the top 1% of all players in ranked and am addicted to this game!
--------------------------------------
Rocket league is a game that you can pickup for the first time and be terrible at, but have that feeling that if you fixed a few things, or made a few different moves, you could have done much much better. It is a fast paced game where:
-The idea of the game is simple
-The controls are exceptional! (For real, the cars all react to your controls exactly how you think they should.)
-The skill cap is insanely high
-Every single time the ball goes in the air, you feel like it is possible to make an insane goal off of it

Rocket league is the type of game that I can pickup for a few games and put back down, or I can just delve deep into an 8 hour session and keep trying to rank up and fix my mistakes I had last game.
------------------------------------
Psyonix (The developer) knows how to run this game. They are constantly pushing out new updates, patches, and content; most of which is free!
They allow you to customize your vehicles, so no two are the same. Or you and some friends can team up, create the exact same cars, then be a three man wrecking crew of flying vans!
Psyonix really thought of everything with Rocket league, and they keep adding more and more great content!
------------------------------------
All-in-all, Rocket league is a great game, cannot recommend it enough, and is totally worth even up to a price of $60! 
(Even though I got it for free!)

So have fun in rocket league, work your way to the top, and...

The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay is responsive, slick and fast-paced, offering enough diverse actions to keep you entertained for hours.

												Overall, this game is awesome. Yes, I know that it is $20 but, it's worth it. After 1 game of it, i got hooked. I love the idea of racing and soccer combined. The Graphics are incredible. A cool feature of this is that you can even customize your car with many combinations. Another great thing in this game is the soundtrack. The one downside (doesn't affect me) is that you will most likely need a high end computer to run this game without lag.

												Rocket League is a physics-based vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in July 2015, with a version for Xbox One and beta versions for OS X and Linux being released in 2016. A physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One began being distributed by 505 Games in June 2016.

This game is really fun, it gives hours of fun with or without your friends, it varies in game modes such as football (soccer) basketball and ice hockey, my personal favourite has got to be soccer, you can spend hours perfecting your touch of the game, by improving ariel strikes, ground striking, goalkeeping, it's endless. It is filled with a great community which can make you a lot of new friends! Once you've gotten better and played a lot at perfecting your touch, you can play more competetive by playing ranked, it's like normal but obviously harder and more competetive. I would definetly recommend this, it has hours of fun, which seems to never end being fun. I would give this a 9/10, it's very fun and I hope to play more."

												Rocket League, the One More Game simulator.

Rocket League is a really fun game for people of all ages and skill-levels.
The only downside is that you will play at least ten more games if you have decided to only play one before going to bed.
The community is pretty toxic, but luckily it's not that hard to just not pay attention to the chat.
The replay value is really high, especially because there are alot of different gamemodes and maps.
You will always try to improve yourself, and you will notice yourself getting better when times moves on, especially when you learn how to fly. Easy to learn, hard to master!

Highly recommened!

												After 250 hours...
Rocket League is a multiplayer game of angles and timing. The only difference here is that you use a car to hit a ball. Playing for a long time doesn't guarantee you becoming skilled, but you'll have a solid base and hopefully don't repeat the same mistakes you made when you first started playing it. Most people will let you know about it, using chat commands sarcastically or call you whatever swear words you can think of. I don't want people to be put off by this, cos it's something you can expect from any multiplayer game, but since the teams are smaller than in FPS games, you get a bigger whiff of the hatred thrown in your direction and the guilt from making a mistake is higher, cos most games are 2v2 or 3v3. Therefore your teammates also have a lower tolerance for mistakes, so get used to losing a teammate when you mess up, even with them risking a time penalty in competitive mode. 1v3 or 2v3 matches can build character or completely throw you off your game, but that's all that Rocket League has ever been, a game of skill, not a cutesy football game with cars.

Recently they added a custom training mode, which was long overdue, cos personally I lack the imagination to grow as a player, so I need these new tutorials to get a sense of how all these tricks work and there's a lot of them. A few hundred hours ago I thought once I master aerials I will be set, but consistently executing well-timed aerials is the bare minimum of Rocket League and I can't even manage that most of the time. I swear I'm still making the same mistakes I made when I first started, cos one thing, I'm so used to using ball cam that I'm often missing shots on the ground and in the air as well. In a way, I've painted myself to a corner and I'm stuck in a limbo of ascending and descending between Prospect I and II in Solo Standard. I've actually regressed in my playstyle and stopped taking risks, which freezes your judgement and makes you prone to even more mistakes. No matter how much hatred or disappointment is expressed at your expense, never forget that the real goal here is to have fun.

All this depressing stuff aside, Rocket League is incredibly fun, otherwise I wouldn't still be playing it. You always want to get better at it. If it weren't for the incredibly responsive and accurate controls, this would not have been the success that it is. Being focused enough to anticipate every move, the trajectory of the ball and to perfectly time your shot is the entire game."

												Rocket League is, as description claims, a sequel to a PS3 game with an overly complicated title that probably contributed to the fact that not many people have heard about it. Neither have I, so when I watched a video of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, I was surprised to learn that Psyonix basically got the whole formula down with their first attempt; mechanics have hardly changed since the first entry into what might be now considered a sort of a franchise. 

That Rocket League is now enjoying far more success than its predecessor is very clear. Some of it may be down to the good timing since it doesn't have to compete with any AAA behemoth, some to PS+ free release and its very important strength: it is highly watchable and thus enjoyed free promotion from streamers and youtube personalities. But it doesn't fully explain the explosion of entusiasm it garnered. 

I think the main reason is that it's almost a perfect execution of its idea. It's addictive, but demanding. Fun from the getgo, but surprisingly deep in terms of its mechanics. If you have all these elements and add polish the result is an extremely engrossing competitive online game. 
You start off by simply attempting to hit a ball, preferably in the direction of the enemy's goal, but in the beginning every hit feels like a success. As you learn to have more control over the car, which thanks to the tactile responsiveness of controls happens at a rather quick pace, you find yourself mixing in more advanced techniques to gain the edge over the enemy. Occasionally you will manage to pull off an impressive move and you will want that to make this a norm. Once you get your technique down to an acceptable level it's no longer enough: you need to ""read the pitch"", predict your opponents' moves, cooperate with your teammates (or not, if you choose to play only 1v1 which you're entirely free to do!). 

This aspect of the game is hard to overstate.  Playing Rocket League constantly demands and leaves room for improvement, both individual and team-based and given that player base is currently huge and matchmaking great, you're going to matched against players just right for you. 
 There is always one caveat that applies to every online game in existence: your mileage may vary. If you're unlucky, you may very well have unpleasant experience with it. You might end up with a series of online problems or bugs. You might very well not be so drawn in by the mechanics or be in the minority of people this game doesn't resonate with. But I say: buy. It's unlikely any of it will apply to you, and if the price is the only source of doubt for you, wait for the first sale and get it then, though in my opinion it's well worth the price of admission."

												WOOOOO! Buy this game! NOW! What are you waiting for?? Screw a sale! it's $20! So very worth it!

I don't normally use an exclamation point after every sentence, but in this case, I WILL!!!

Thank you Angry Joe! So glad I follow all of his episodes at times like this! :D

Original and ridiculously fun. Just the fact that it's original says a lot. Trying to be original these days is basically impossible, but here it is, in all its glory.

Cars + Soccer = I didn't realize I liked soccer till now!

9/10 - RECOMMENDED!

												Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam group
Few words about the game

Recently bought this game with few of my friends and we became addicted to it. You will have really nice time playing it, with your friends or without them as people are quite nice in matchmaking. Good and simple action packed game. Movement is quite simple but really takes alot of time to perfectly master it. This game have everything you need to relieve from CS:GO rage.

Advantages
 - Game handles very well, doesn't matter if you play on keyboard or controller
 - Matchmaking is good and quick
 - AMAZING soundtrack
 - Suprisingly good graphics
 - Takes time to master ""movement"" what makes you want to play more to be better at itDisadvantages
 - Playing against bots is pointless, you could aswell take an empty court
 - From time to time there are little troubles with connection
 - Really, like... REALLY addictive

Rocket League review
I don't really enjoy playing football/racing games (or just any sports game in general), but for some reason when you blend the two together, you get a really fun game! I've honestly been doubtful to get this one, but don't have any regrets buying it - not even after playing it on and off for a good year.

After first being introduced to it by watching E3, I told myself to keep this game in mind because I might want to buy it sometime in the (distant) future. A little bit later, checking out some twitch as usual, this game was just everywhere. So I watched some streams and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Much more than I had anticipated. So eventually I decided to just buy this game and give it a go. I have to say it's been long since I bought a game at full price, but it has been totally worth it. 

What I like

+ Gameplay is VERY enjoyable: intense, hilarious, chaotic and rageworthy
+ Easy to learn, hard to master
+ Tutorial + training areas!
+ Matches are short (5 minutes), making it ideal for casual players also
+ You don't need friends for this game, however I do recommend playing with them
+ AI (computer controlled) cars are pretty decent
+ Car customization!
+ Game looks gorgeous
+ Some nice catchy tunes that totally get you into the mood for some intense Racing/football
+ It's best played with a controller, but mouse and keyboard do work fine too
+ Price tag is about right

What I don't like

- Fairly toxic community at times (hence why I recommend to play with friends)
- AI cars (not always so decent)

Conclusion

Overhyped? Maybe, but all in all, a very enjoyable game. Whether you just want a quick 20 min break or a long 3- hour session, it's all up to you. One thing is for sure: you'll have fun. That is, if you don't take the game too seriously."

												This game makes soccer (football) extremely fun due to being a car with rockets. You will learn to control your car to hit the ball in various angles. Then you will jump and hit the ball and using your second jump (or dodge depending on direction) to navigate the battlefield or hit the ball harder. Then you will learn the beautiful art of rocket ballet as you use your boost to fly for short periods of time while scoring goals. Mix all those elements with teamwork for a simple, yet extremely complex game filled with sick plays, amazing comebacks, and did he just score a goal flying backwards? What!?

Forget FIFA. Play Rocket League.

I should now mention that their post-launch support has been nothing short of amazing. I don't agree with their decision to include gambling boxes for cosmetics (I prefer to buy things directly), but the amount of free content and excellent modes has been substantial. Rumble has been one of the best modes they've added to the game. The other bonus modes have their own followings too. Some people just play Hockey League exclusively.

Rocket League has incredibly fun gameplay and is backed by a great developer. I just hope they avoid becoming a money hungry monster, but they've been doing a splendid job so far.

They've added a training mode where you can create playlists of different shots for scoring or defending. This is the best addition to the game since Rumble and is incredibly fun to play. I enjoy both making and experiencing what others have created."

												For something as simple as soccer/football played with turbo-powered cars, Rocket League is way more in-depth and entertaining than it might appear on the surface. Fast-paced, clean-looking, and hard not to enjoy even when you're losing or making embarrassing mistakes, this game will give you plenty of moments where you're geeking out over some incredible shot, save, or block - and it will give you just as many moments of intense, stress-inducing close calls or just-barely-missed opportunities.

Played like a much smaller (player-wise) version of soccer/football - with several variations like 1 vs 1, 3 vs 3 (the standard), 4 vs 4, etc. - Rocket League is an interesting mix of competitive sports and driving/racing, pitting players against each other on two teams in five minute matches. An interesting twist, however, is the rocket-powered aspect of the cars and the ""boost"" fuel that players have to pick up and manage throughout the match. While it might seem like something strictly used for speed, it plays into essentially every aspect of the game, from controlling yourself in the air to making/blocking shots as well as to take other players out. With both resource management and getting a feel for how the cars control or the ball works, the game can feel very random and chaotic at first, often leaving you feeling like any play you make is chance or luck; to me, however, this is where Rocket League's longevity and replayability really comes into play. 

You might be clueless initially and have no idea what you're doing (yet still manage to make plays), but the game unfolds more and more as you play and get your bearings. While one match you're barely struggling to hit the ball in the air, soon enough you'll hit them every time and come to find that as you practice you have way more control over the game and yourself than the chaotic atmosphere might let on. The high-flying bounces, the impossible-to-save/strike shots - it all will eventually be something you can not only handle consistently, but also open you up to the other techniques in the game like aerial movement/shots and boost control.

Combine the solid gameplay and skill progression with an easy-to-use interface and good soundtrack (which should totally have an option to enable during matches!) and Rocket League is a surprisingly fun, easy-to-play but hard-to-master game that's both something you can pick up every now and then as well as play for hours."

												Rocket League is a physics based football type game(no I will not call it soccer). It is actually a sequel to a game called Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars.  Rocket League was released in early July 2015 on the PC and PlayStation 4. 

The gameplay is very simple, you control a rocket powered car and you use it to play a game of football. To many this may sound boring and unfun if you aren't a fan of either cars, or football - let me reassure you though, even if you aren't a fan, I guarantee you will have fun whilst playing Rocket League. The game is highly addictive and it will keep you playing until the early hours of the morning with that ""Just one more match"" feel to it. 

Rocket League has a single player mode, an online multiplayer mode and a local multiplayer mode. I haven't played the single player as the multiplayer is completely where the action is at. The match making system works flawlessly, you will not have any problems finding a game, as of right now there are over 20,000 people playing. Each match lasts 5 minutes, and can consist of teams of 1, 2, 3 or 4 people. Personally I enjoyed the more hectic type matches of 3 or 4. Another nice little bonus is that Rocket League also works cross-platform, meaning you could end up being in a match with PS4 players which is one of the first I've seen run this type of system. 

The controls are very simple, and you can pick them up in a matter of seconds.It is highly recommended that you play this game with a controller though, I have not heard any success stories of people using keyboard and mouse to play. 

Graphically, Rocket League is an awesome game to look at, just the right amount of lens flare, smooth animations and gorgeous looking backgrounds and arenas to play in. The game is ran using Unreal Engine 3, and it has been pushed to look stunning. 

I wouldn't exactly say Rocket League to be a difficult game, it has a very pick up and play vibe to it, but it will take you a couple of hours to become a real asset to your team mates, rather than just driving back and forth on the map chasing the ball. 

I have been playing Rocket League for almost six hours now, I am by no means a master at this game, and it feels as if I am only scratching the surface of the skill level you can reach. Like I said, this game is highly addictive, you will really struggle to put it down after you boot it up. The fast paced action and quick matches keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. 

This game runs as smooth as a babies bottom, the 60 fps, high resolutions and customize-able graphics make this a really PC game that is highly worth your time.' We are looking at one of the games of the year right here. 

 Tom's Score Card
1) Stay away
2) Only recommended when on sale
3) Recommended
4) Highly recommended
5) This is a must play

												Rocket League is pure, perfected and well-balanced fun.

You'll be addicted like an home alone 5yr old kid who knows where the peanut butter is. You'll suck your fingers every time you score a goal and you'll wake up your family screaming GOAL as you do a barrel roll and score the most incredible goal. The controls are sleek and the matchmaking thing is fast. I hope the game will have more matchmaking things like leagues and tournaments. Easy to have fun, hard to master fully, I recommend it to everyone, especially if you have friends to play with."

												Amazingly fun game that has all the fun elements of FIFA without the tedious bits.

If you've seen videos of Rocket League and think ""gee that would be hard to learn"" you're wrong and you're right. It's very easy to pick up but to pull off crazy aerials is hard and will take many, many hours to master.

The matchmaking service seems to work quite well and it's quick so if it does get things wrong and puts you in a game which is too easy or too hard it's not a big deal to look for another match.

Best to play with at least one friend so you can 2v2 others without having to deal with team mates dropping out or rage quitting.

I waited for it to be on sale but honestly it's worth full price. Hell I would happily have paid $50 for it. It's that fun."

My favorite Hobby+Football game.I'm usually dont Play Football game's but Rocket League is a Diffrent Style of Football game and because its with vehicles that you can customize and give them some Makeovers.
This Game is Totally Worth the Money.

												The proof  that a game doesn't need to be mechanically complex to be compelling. Rocket Leauge is as simple as video games get. But it's tweaked and polished to perfection, making every moment all kill and no fill. And when the game is at it's best moments, whether it be the tense stand offs when all the players rush for the ball at kickoff or 30 seconds left on the clock with a tied scoreboard. It can be genuinely hard to put down. It harks back to simpler times, when video games didn’t need a billion bells and whistles to keep players interested. They just needed great design, and that’s exactly what you get with Rocket League. Soccer with cars. And it's beautiful."

												This game makes me rage more than any game I've ever played (probably because I'm absolute ♥♥♥♥ at it). This game and CSGO are the only video games where I've seen myself improve dramatically, and that is wonderful. I feel on top of the world when I win and like total garbage when I lose. I have actually spent 2 hours in practice mode trying to perfect my skills because I care so much about winning in this game.
9.5/10
One of the greatest experiences I've had ever in video games."

												This game is amazing. In spite of having a high skill ceiling, it is very fun at every skill level. 1v1's are very exciting to measure up individual skills and mind tricks, 2v2s and 3v3s are awesome to team up with your friends (and even randoms), 4v4s are waaay too crazy for my taste but can also be fun.

The newest update included mutators, and they are hilarious to play with friends.

Everything is well done, the gameplay, the graphics, and the mechanics. Even the DLC is well done; they're just cosmetic, they're cool, and they're cheap (Back to the Future DLC).

The developer keeps the game updated with free maps, cosmetic stuff and game modes too.

My only complaint is that it should have a custom training mode, where you can move the ball launcher around, disable goal replay, disable infinite boost, etc...

This will be my favorite game for quite some time for sure."

The local co-op makes it a great game for a party and the simple controls are inviting to everyone. The game length feels just right and the matchmaking system is fast. This is the only game on steam that will allow you to land a bicycle kick goal with a rocket powered battle car."

												 Very addictive and entertaining game. 

Rocket League is a game that always introduces new aspects to you and never lets you get bored. It is definitely a 'just 5 more minutes' game but amazingly entertaining at the same time. The trading community is excellent and finally getting an item you always wanted can leave you feeling so accomplished. The car customization itself is an awesome feature that offers so many different customizations. As you progress through the different skill levels there are new techniques to learn and playstyles which are awesome to know. The competitive scene behind this game is getting larger and it is so fun to watch such high level players play!

All in all, i'd completely recommend this game to anyone, whether you're a casual player or very competitive!"

												I don't usually buy games at full price (especially not at $20), but decided to give this a try.  Long story short, it has been worth every penny, and is one of the most addictive games I have played in years.  

Pros - Perfect for study breaks since each match is only about 5 minutes.  Read one chapter of your textbook... reward yourself with a match.
 - Simple and easy to play, but challenging to master.  Figuring out how to hit the ball (especially in the air) is difficult at first, and there is a learning curve.
 - Great developers who have already announced free DLCs (along with extra paid cosmetic DLCs).
 - Optimized even for low-spec PCs.
 - Cross-platform with PS4.

Cons - There used to be a problem with people quitting midway through a ranked game with no penalty.  However, now there is a 15 minute ban from matchmaking for leaving ranked games, so it is not as much an issue now.
 - Difficult to play without a controller, but still possible.  I would recommend a controller if you buy this.
 - Occasional lag on servers (but hopefully will be resolved in the future).

Overall, I would highly recommend this game.  10/10"

												Rocket League is a fun mixup of a sports game and an arcade game. You can play either 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, the ranked varients of those matches, or the seasonal extra sport, which currently is Basketball. There are pads around the arena that give you boost so you can catch up to your opponents much quicker.

~Pros~
1.) Wide-spread Vechical Customizations, From Colors To Even Hats
2.) Easy To Learn Controls That Can Be Rebinded To Suit Your Play
3.) Rapidly Growing Competitive Scene, Now Spreading Into ESL Leagues

~Cons~
1.) Although The Controls Are Easy To Learn, They Are Very Hard To Master
2.) Teammates Will Almost Always Blame The Other Teams Goal On You, And Take Credit For All Of Your Goals

Thats about all I can think of right now, hope you all enjoy this game, highly recommended."

												Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...

Rookie - You can't hit ♥♥♥♥. You are a disgrace to your team and the game.

Semi Pro - You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still ♥♥♥♥.

Pro - You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller, ♥♥♥♥-head.

Veteran - You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!

Expert - You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.

Master - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam ""Sorry!"" every time they do something wrong to you.

Legend - The most badass-looking title you can have. ♥♥♥♥ Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""

Rocketeer - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag, but if you didn't: Still prepare for another endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Rocketeer!""

But in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole-nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)

If you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review, just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA). 
Think about it this way: You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game. Ignore the childish-looking pictures on the store page. Just get this game. This is the one.

EDIT - 2/13/2016: You know a game is amazing when the servers go down and you'd rather train offline than play any of your other 100 games...

												This is my experience after playing the game for the first time with a friend:

- got game, made party, got into a casual 2v2 match
- 2 a.m., window wide open - forgot
- start match
- 30 minutes of rage/joy/fun/screaming
- someone starts bashing on my front door
- figure it's downstairs neighbour
- go silent, ignore
- still bashing
- still silent/ignore
- almost breaks down my door
- have to open, see who it is
- see cops, jail imminent
- panic
- open door, act nice
- cop says he heard me down on the street in his car with his windows closed
- start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting him, I say the neighbour usually warns me first before calling the cops
- cop says it wasn't the downstairs neighbour who called, but the one in the BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET
- almost start laughing
- cop asks WTF was I doing
- start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting him again
- he asks why I have the window open
- say I totally forgot
- he asks: ""What game are you playing?""
- he knows.
- I ask: ""Is that a serious question?""
- he says: ""Don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t me, I've been a gamer for 15 years - what game?""
- I say: ""Rocket League.""
- he gives me a slight smile/nod of approval/understanding
- HE KNOWS.
- gives me back my ID: ""Keep the noise down, goodnight.""

												Absolutely amazing game. I really didn't expect this much fun when I first got it, but holy damn. I've never had this much instant fun in a game in a loooong time. I also don't think I've had this much adrenaline while playing a game ever. 

Absolutely amazing game design. Its extremely juicy; there are great effects and small touches that really, really add to the fun of the game. Everything you do feels satisfying and extremely responsive. Controls are very intuitive as well if you use a controller, such as Xbox or PS.

So deceptively simple, yet so insanely fun. Not much depth on the outside, but once you play you realize that there is a lot of depth, and a LOT of potential.

Easy to play, hard to master.

Buy this game. Now."

Pros:
Football (if you're a fan of that)
Cars
Great mechanics
Great physics
Bots are on par with players (from what I've experienced)
Great visuals
Suitable for both casual and veteran gamers alike
Being updated a lot and updates include a lot of cool stuff
Cons:
I can't think of any cons at the moment
This game is a perfect example of a football game done right, and in general, a perfect example of a game done right. It's so hard to find anything bad about Rocket League. This tops pretty much every football game ever released, even FIFA. Final verdict is an A++."

- Fast cars!
- Flying cars!
- Blowing people up!
- Ranked & Casual games!
- Completly destorying oppontants 15-0... also getting destroyed albiet not as pleasurable!
- Local Co-op (upto 4 players), multiple local player can also play against or with online players.
- Great replay features
- Spectator mode
- Very capable AI
- Not too bad community, most are friendly and respectful. Some are quite bitter!
- 5 min games keep you busy for HOURS! Literally! Time seems to fly playing this game.
- Offline season mode is... acceptable.
- Cant comment on DLC, dont own it.

The very worst thing to say to yourself when playing this game... ""ONE MORE!"""

												I play this too much.

I'm sure you've already heard numerous great things about this game. I can definitely agree to them. This game screams fun regardless of if you've played 1 hour or 1000 hours. Even if you're losing, you find yourself having fun. And that's the mark of a seriously great game, in my eyes.

Rocket League can be played casually or competitively, boasting both unranked and ranked queues. It is a simple enough concept that people are already familiar with even before playing their first game (it's damn soccer dude, if you don't know you've been living under a rock very far away from Europe, possibly on the moon Europa). But then, it has such an incredibly high skillcap. You'd probably still be learning new manouevres and the like well into 2000 hours (give it time though).

I don't play with a controller as I don't own one, but I know that 99% of people recommend controller over keyboard/mouse. And from an unbiased standpoint, I would agree, as the analogs make ball control and fine movement much easier than WASD or the like. Regardless, if you do choose to play keyboard like a dummie (read: like me), then consider making a custom bind that doesn't use the mouse.

I could go on and on. But I'll let the game do the talking; go buy it. Believe me, for $20, this is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing steal. Best $20 I ever spent tbh.

10/10 would play again (actually am playing as I write this)

The first thing I did was try the tutorial, which impressed me on how tight and responsive the conrols are.  That was a really good sign for a sport where control is necessary.  Next we jumped into an match with easy bots and I scored a goal in the first 4 seconds.  OK, I was not expecting that to feel so satisfying.  That was the exact point that the hook was set.  

It is not easy to score goals.  You wait back at midfield for the right time to speed burst towards a centered pass only to see it go wide or deflect off another player.  You circle back and try to attack again and again.  Time goes by, and then you find yourself colliding with a teammate and happen to bump into the ball that trickles just fast enough to cross the goal line before the opponent can fly over to stop it.  The feeling of triumph floods over you and you cannot stop your grin from growing over your face. 

I am not even 2 hours in at this point and I already see the promise this game holds.  The potential for great fun with friends is there, and that's the key.  I find myself looking forward to my next match.  I can't wait to get out there and drive around like a crazed lunatic and smash some buddies into the wall."

												Well, i'm sure my hours (5000+ as of now...send help) speak for my testimony when I say: this game is perfect.

I've had a hard time finding a game to sink my time into in the past due to story conflicts and other issues. As for Rocket League? It's simple, it's well made, and it's a blast.

The five minute rounds offer an ADHD filled event of rocket powered cars soaring through the air, slamming into one another, and explosive balls when you score! You can save replays to go back and watch your impressive goals, or to make beautiful videos. Different roles await: do you fancy yourself as the dashing striker who brings your team to victory? Or perhaps the demolition expert  who pushes your rivals to the breaking point and opens up opportunites to score? Or even the goalie, denying the enemy the sweet sweet taste of success. JUMP ON IN!

PROS:
-Full car cuztomization
-Rocket Powered Acrobatic Aerial Capabilities!
-Vibrant graphics
-Intuitive replay system
-1v1- 4v4 Online play
-2-4 Player split screen action!
-Season mode
-Ranked online!
-Demolition
-Training modes
-Kind and open Devs!
-Incoming DLC including maps from SARPBC!
-ONLY $20! (Free on PS4)

CONS:
-Slight lag spikes depending on region.
-There's people who don't have this game yet."

												Now I'm not usually the ""sports"" game type. I don't play FIFA or any other sports game (I say ""or any other sports game"" because no other franchises were coming to my mind, THAT'S how little I play of them), but there's just something about hitting a giant ball around with a little remote control car that's much more entertaining than those other ""real"" sports games."

												This game doesn’t really need another “thumbs up” but I feel obligated to write a review since I spent 100+ hours playing it (by the way, that’s a lie! I only played a couple of matches!) 

It doesn’t matter if you are a racing/football fan or not. You’ll love it. This game appeals to both casual and competitive players. You will suck most of the time and sometimes score amazing goals and it would feel incredible! This is one of those games that is easy to learn and very hard to master. I am still horrible at it after 100 hours. The good thing is that it is still entertaining even if you are losing more often than winning. 

So is it a great game? Hell, yes! Do I recommend it? No, unless you want to get sucked in and get addicted to this devil’s child of a game. 

I got it for free with Steam hardware. At this point I am ready to pay $20 just to get rid of it. I am uninstalling it tonight. I am just going to play one match real quick. Ok, maybe two... 

Addiction Level: Crack cocaine / 10.

UPDATE: I now have 300+ hours in this game. Please send help.
UPDATE 2: 500 hours... whatever, keep my soul, Rocket League!"

												Cars and Football 10/10.

Pros-
Strongly Addictive
All cars perform the exact same meaning there are no OP options
Great customisable unlocks
Matchmaking is fair
Great optimisation
Very intense and action packed
Something you can play for hours on end
No glitches
Great physics and mechanics
Bots perform very much alike other players
Oh, and did I mention it was strongly addictive...

Cons-
Servers go down quite often

Possible improvements that I believe would keep this games popularity and addictiveness-
Free DLC introducing new stadiums, cars and more customisable options to unlock
Competitive matchmaking system (Similar to Counter Strike Global Offense)
24/7 working matchmaking servers!

Anyone debating whether to get this or not should BUY IT NOW!"

												Rocket League is next game of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Both game is a physic-based vehicle soccer game. But they improved game a lot since SARPBC.

-This game has a lot of content.(Maps, DLC packs, Ranked play etc.)
-Car costumization really good. You can make however you want your car.
-There is 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 game modes available and you can play this modes as ranked.
-Ranked system changed now. It's much better than number based rank system.
-They're now making competitive tournaments offically.I think they will improve it in the future.
-They're adding several mods but they usually remove them later.
-Game has some optimization issues i think usually show itself at low end pc systems.

I definitely recommend this game. Community growing up and will be bigger in the future."

5 hours later, I was telling myself ""just.... 1.... more.... game....""

Needless to say, I'm hooked. It's great fun when you're on a roll, but when you go up against a team of semi-pros, it can be both frustrating and depressing. But I suppose that can go for any competitive game."

""You don't like soccer - that totally doesn't matter!""
2 Teams with max. 4 boost cars each, 2 goals and 1 giant ball. That's it - and it definitely makes a whole lot of fun! +NEW GAME MODES have been added FOR FREE! (baskeball is awesome)

Pros:
+ thousands of active players online (90k+)
+ great gameplay
+ great but difficult controls
+ very good graphics
+ beginner (&expert) friendly
+ pure real skills (no skill-tree)
+ no referre
+ no fouls
+ no ""wrong"" decisions
=> must play on tv & with firends (local&online)

Cons:
- no penalty 
=> at least the option; e.g. instead of an overtime
- no points for touching/dribbling/flanking the ball
""I really wish to see more game modes (e.g. ""MarioKartSoccer"") and the option to create Ur own decals.""

-All items to modify your car are free to use, you just need to unlock them by winning games.
-1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 mode.
-Nice to play with friends.
-A lot of people playing. (Average is 25.000 players in-game)

In the beginning it seemed like a fun game with simple controls but as I've progressed far I've realised it has a lot of depth.

All in all its instantly a surprise hit of the year and one of my all-time favourite games.

												Not much explanation needed. Soccer with cars.... they even got hockey and basketball. I love this game.
My only complaint is that the servers could be a lot better, this is one of the only games that I have network problems with (lagging, teleporting, driving in a straight line and getting pushed side to side etc.). Some servers perform fine others are just garbage. 
I strongly recommend using a controller for this game."

												Cars were always meant to play soccer/football.  It's just the way the world was meant to be.  This game fills that giant circular hole in your heart.  
It's a ton of fun, the AI was well made and actually gives you a decent fight at higher levels, and the awesome trick shots you can attempt (and in my case mostly miss) are fun all day long."

												Rocket League is a physics-based vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in July 2015, with a version for Xbox One and beta versions for OS X and Linux being released in 2016. A physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One began being distributed by 505 Games in June 2016.

This game is really fun, it gives hours of fun with or without your friends, it varies in game modes such as football (soccer) basketball and ice hockey, my personal favourite has got to be soccer, you can spend hours perfecting your touch of the game, by improving ariel strikes, ground striking, goalkeeping, it's endless. It is filled with a great community which can make you a lot of new friends! Once you've gotten better and played a lot at perfecting your touch, you can play more competetive by playing ranked, it's like normal but obviously harder and more competetive. I would definetly recommend this, it has hours of fun, which seems to never end being fun. I would give this a 9/10, it's very fun and I hope to play more."

												Got the game for a solid 20 euro and it is worth the money.

Plus points:
+Great depth in the game, easy to pick up but hard to master
+Good user interface and options
+Fantastic music and soundtracks
+Controller support and split screen support
+Debugged game and almost no bugs left
+Good performance and also enough options to adjust and scale
+Content updates to add more content
+Easy to create steam parties and invite your friends

Minus points:
-Did not like when they introduced the crate system, atleast let players pick what item they want and not the pull the slot machine and pray on getting some you dont have yet.
-Price reduction on the crate keys, €0,25 would be more interesting and logical from a business point of view (customers would also buy it more if it was cheap)
-At the moment you cannot try any DLC cars before buying it, let there be a few test drives so users can try before buying it.
-No DLC bundles, make some bigger packs so you can buy DLC in larger and cheaper packs."

You'll be addicted like an home alone 5yr old kid who knows where the peanut butter is. You'll suck your fingers every time you score a goal and you'll wake up your family screaming GOAL as you do a barrel roll and score the most incredible goal. The controls are sleek and the matchmaking thing is fast. I hope the game will have more matchmaking things like leagues and tournaments. Easy to have fun, hard to master fully, I recommend it to everyone, especially if you have friends to play with."

												First of all, im reviewing the single player ""seasons"" mode, as i have not played multiplayer.
I was hesitant at first to buy this game, as an arcade style game for 20 dollars seemed like a bit too much, but i have to say, this game turned out to be much better than i thought.
It runs smoothly with little to no lag, and the controls are smooth (Using a wired Xbox 360 Controller) and that is something that a game as chaotic as this one certainly needs.
The customization options for your vehicle are very fun to play around with, and you can end up with some pretty crazy looking cars! And you unlock the items just by playing matches, which makes it very easy to get new items.
The camera options are very convenient, Allowing you to change the FOV, Height, Angle, and distance of the camera.
Now, for the actual game, the seasons mode is very fun and competitive, allowing you to pick from different teamates, and to choose how many cars are on the teams. 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 are the option. 4v4 is my favourite so far though, as it's rather chaotic.
Possibly the best thing about seasons mode is that even by yourself you still get very competitive, and that's something that i dont think many games deliver on.
The music is a bit garbled and im not sure whether or not its supposed to play all the time, as it usualy stops within a few secconds.
Overall, for a game that was just released, it is very fun and i'd recommend it to everyone, whether they like sports or not. I think this game would be even more entertaining with friends, but i don't have any friends that own this game."

												Football With Cars

This game I have enjoyed over 700 hours on...

Great fun and a fantastic game for trading.

You can buy DLC, trade items, play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 modes. Even hockey and basketball make it into this game. You got so many options to play with it's great. Freestyle goals, funny goals, stunts, saves etc.

So many great memories can be had from this game.

However it's not flawless, one thing you need to be careful of, is scamming.

You are your own guard for scams. Read a guide on how to avoid scammers, as the items in this game are worth alot. Some items worth around £500. Anyone can be a scammer so watch yourself. 

Toxic people are a problem, this game has over 25 million players, alot are toxic, alot are scammers, alot are rage quiters etc. You want to avoid a toxic player? Simple solution. ""Mute"" them when things go south. Done, no more cursing, swearing etc. All with the click of a button.

All in all, this game I would recommend."

												TL;DR 

---------

Its addictive and my most played game to date. Please buy it in or out of a sale :)

So, I was going to write a review at 100 hours but another 100 later and its... Been a few days... What can I say, the game is worth it at full price PLUS DLC (I have most DLC -- 3 are needed to 100% achievements). This game is very easy to pick up and there are tons of skills to master the game -- from dribbling to advanced aerials -- if you want to play it competitively or just improve. Plus there are tons more to come with Rocket Labs introduced and there is a basketball mode in the making as I write this review :)

---------

Pros -- 
 Great customization with base game and/or with DLC. You can customize paint, wheels, car body, the boost, hats etc!
 Great common and uncommon drops
 Gameplay is steady, you can easily play with keyboard and mouse or controller (I personally use an Xbox One controller)
 Love the soundtrack 
 Achievements are easy but maybe a little bit of a grind for some 
 The UI is clean and well set out -- there is even a nice quick chat feature (Nice shot, Centering, Defending etc)
 You can save replays to watch later or upload to youtube
 It's so much fun to play alone in 1v1, matchmaking in 2v2/3v3/4v4 or with friends
 Community is mostly friendly, you can now report... the rest...
  The devs are great, they are constantly changing the game with a new ranked system and maps etc!
  Great training modes and multiple levels of difficulty of AI to practice offline or before/in between a match
Well... You get the point with the pros...

Cons
  Achievements and little content in the DLC does not feel worth it but forces you to buy if you want to 100% the game... DLC isn't needed so not a big deal. But hey... Batmobile DLC... GET IT! 
 I have had maybe 2 crashes and a few bad connections in my time, but it reconnects you to the match you were in so you don't lose XP 
Conclusion... Buy the game. Its awesome. I've had a blast and there will be many more hours of fun to come! The game will only get better from here! Whoops... Nice shot! 10/10 <3"

												I watched a lot of people play on Twitch and it looked okay.  Let me tell you this - it is MUCH more fun to play than it is to watch.  Pretty much every gamer needs this game.

9/10 - played for 4 hours straight the first time I played.

No microtransactions
Purely skill based
Unlockable customization

This is how every game should be."

												This isn't just a game. This a lecture from Psyonix.

A lecture on designing an extremelly fun and addicting game.
A lecture on building a high quality and very well optimized game.
A lecture on mantaining a multiplayer game running all around the world and working smoothly across differente platforms.

And more important though incredibly rare these days: A lecture on charging the right price, for the right amount of content with the right quality standard."

												I've spent 900 hours on this game, which is the most I have ever spent on any game. For 20 dollars this is an insane deal and an incredibly well-crafted game. Highly recommended

Edit: It is hard to believe I wrote this 800 Rocket League hours ago. I have nearly doubled the playtime that I had when I first wrote my review and I still find myself playing regularly. The game has only gotten better since, with the inclusion of more customization options, and soon to be better training options. Psyonix has really listened to the community and are an exemplary model for all game developers. I gave this game my full recommendation 800 hours ago, and I am giving it once again. Rocket League is the best game I have ever played."

												Best competitive gameFootball (for US colleagues Soccer) with cars, double jumps, rotket boost in the a$$ and some level of car customization. These words can describe rocket league in whole. Oh and yes, you can play now against our console colleagues which creates really broad spectrum of talents through all the platforms so u will definetly find your place there. 
This game can be categorised as ""Easy to learn, hard to master"" game. The basics are the same, only the cars differ in some slight characteristics. It all comes to your skill. Check some of my videos on my profile of this game so you can see what all you can do there ;)

 GOOD things: 
    Fun
    Can fly and score amazing shots
    Competitive (even ranked play)
    Addictive
    Easy to learn, hard to master - skill matters
    Many mods and maps
    Teamwork over solo skill - as in every team game (tested by experience)
    Massive Replay possibilities BAD things: 
    Addictive
    Hard to climb the ranked ladder without good teammates
    Many kids and ragers - rly have to have good friends to enjoy the gameplay"

												Psyonix's magnum opus, Rocket League, is one of the most fun games I've had the joy to play. The master of fast-paced, addictive gameplay, the 5 minute matches keep you playing into the early hours of the morning and never failing to keep the action above 60mph! The vertical flexability that the openness of a Rocket League pitch offers is incredible, boasting a Cirque de liberté for you to perform all sorts of zany twists and turns in mid-air, it's remarkable to see glorious goals and superb saves made by some of the insanely talented players. One can better their Rocket League play naturally, by simply enjoying the game, however, the more difficult tricks like; airials, freestyles, dribbling and perfect positioning take some serious skill and precision and are a sight to see in competitive play. The game's perfectly playable with either a controller or mouse 'n' keyboard, so it's up to you to decide how you play. The customisation is great, fine-tuning your Rocket-Powered Battle-Car is fantastic and the options are near endless, offering plenty of choice. However, there is microtransactions. But, these are implemented in one of the best ways I've seen in any game, they're not intrusive or necessary for victory AT ALL, they're simply cosmetic. The free Rumble gamemode is serious fun and it's nice to see the devs frequently adding new features and stadiums to one of the most fun games of 2015. I don't care too much for either cars or football, but I adore Rocket League. Totally worth its full price and it's a steal on sale, highly recommended."

												This game is amazing. In spite of having a high skill ceiling, it is very fun at every skill level. 1v1's are very exciting to measure up individual skills and mind tricks, 2v2s and 3v3s are awesome to team up with your friends (and even randoms), 4v4s are waaay too crazy for my taste but can also be fun.

The newest update included mutators, and they are hilarious to play with friends.

Everything is well done, the gameplay, the graphics, and the mechanics. Even the DLC is well done; they're just cosmetic, they're cool, and they're cheap (Back to the Future DLC).

The developer keeps the game updated with free maps, cosmetic stuff and game modes too.

My only complaint is that it should have a custom training mode, where you can move the ball launcher around, disable goal replay, disable infinite boost, etc...

This will be my favorite game for quite some time for sure."

												Okay, okay. Yes, I still exist. I meant to post this review earlier but I couldn't due to some technical issues.


Let me put this out here: I'm not a soccer fan. Probably because I'm an American (despite my name) but I just never got into it. I played it when I was three and quit before our first game, so I was never big on it. But then I was introduced to Rocket League. At first, I didn't care too much for it. Eventually, however, I soon realized I was missing out. When I was on the verge of buying it, my awesome friend Cyroden bought the game for me at the most convenient time. After playing it when I had my opportunities, I'm ready to give an opinion on it.

Graphics
The game is gorgeous. Very gorgeous at that. Compared to other ""sports"" games, this one stands out. Everything is incredibly detailed and is high quality compared to the other potatoes we've gotten in the past few years. Not to mention, this game comes with a replay feature, and with it, if used properly, you can make some incredible screenshots. I don't have any issues with anything here.

Gameplay 
This is the core of the game. If this is bad, then it's not worth buying the game. But I gave this game a thumbs-up, so you know what I'm going to say. Everything is very smooth and flopping around in a car is just flat out awesome. It's a simple concept but it has a learning curve that's quite time consuming to master. I would highly recommend a controller to ease the suffering a little bit, but it's not that necessary. It's still playable with the keyboard and mouse. Getting adjusted to the controls can take a bit of time, because I first mixed jumping and toggling the ball camera up, and it didn't turn out so well. Some of the controls do seem questionable, even after I converted to controller with this game. However, it isn't too rough and you should manage to get the hang of it within a couple of hours. Also, if you're a dude who loves creating stuff (like myself) then praise the devs of this game for adding a car editor here. There's also no pay-to-win techniques or anything here, you can get every single item in the game without spending a dime, and there's no way you can pay for the items anyway. Everything is unlockable, and the editor is simple to use. Would I add some more to it? Yes. But it's so rare to find any kind of simplistic editors these days I'm already thankful there's one in this game.

Story
There's no story, it's just a multiplayer game meant to be fun, this won't be counted towards the final score.

Audio
This one is going to be short and sweet as it doesn't really matter all that much in this situation. The music fits and some of the tunes can be catchy, and the audio is pretty solid as well. There are no major flaws, but there's nothing to drool over here.

Replayability
Of course, this is the debatable one here. I didn't get hopelessly addicted to it, but I still really enjoy this game. My one problem, and it's probably the biggest issue I have with the game, is the fact that it seems heavily reliant on having friends play with you. I had friends to play this game, and when I played with them, it made a significant difference in the fun factor of the game. I would've played a lot more of this if it wasn't for the fact it's not as fun if you're playing alone. But, it does excel in the fact that it's a fun game to play with friends so I'd recommend trying to find some out in the wild.

Verdict
Rocket League is flat out fun. Yes, it's flawed, but it's still an excellent title to play if you've got some friends, a controller (preferably) and a free night where you've got nothing to do. Finally, a game that had a clean PC release and didn't try and drain your money!

Graphics - 9.5/10
Gameplay - 9.0/10
Story - NONE
Audio - 7.5/10
Replayability - 7.5/10

.:8.4/10:.

+Beautiful graphics
+Smooth, simple gameplay with a solid learning curve

+No cheap pay-to-win techniques
+Acceptable audio...

-...but it doesn't get any awards
-Heavily reliant on having friends

												In the 80s and 90s, this is what everyone thought video games would be like in the future: rocket cars playing virtual sports; TRONxSpeed Racer, with the international appeal of soccer. 
You're jacked in to this new thing called the Internet, where you can play against people the world 'round. You're a weakly 13 year old midwesterner named Billy, but when you're jacked in, you're Tom Cruise in Top Gun, no, Days of Thunder. You're the best there ever was.

Stay on target, stay on target... click, blarp. You're out of rocket fuel! You click again just in case, like a last desperate pull of an empty gun's trigger. The clock ticks downward as you swerve towards a boost pickup... you grab it... seconds left on the clock... the ball appears in front of you as an angel out of the blue... you jump, squeeze the last bit of juice out of your machine and soar heavenward... AND IT'S GOOD! BILLY FROM THE MIDWEST HAS DEFEATED THE RUSSIAN MENACE!!!!

Every second you play the game is the last five minutes of every sports movie ever made."

												Rocket League is a Football(Soccer) inspired sports game made by Psyonix. In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Football(Soccer) with cars. It might be the best game I've played this year so far.

There are a few different game modes, including online, Exhibition where you play against bots or your friends in local play, and a season mode where you play as a member on a team and you try and complete a season and win the championship. The game modes are fun, but not very different from each other. I do wish the Season mode was more like a Franchise mode in something like Madden, being able to control all the little things of your team, and having more stat tracking would make it a lot better, but its still worth a play or two.

The gameplay in this game is perfect. Once you figure out the flow to your car, how to use boosting properly, and how to track the ball, you'll realize just how addicing the game can be. Against bots or online, the game shines in its fun and addicting gameplay that adds a unique twist on the game of Football(Soccer). Learning the game comes quick, but mastering the techniques could easily take 30-50 hours of gameplay. 

You have a large selection of cars and different things you can design them with. The speed and hitboxes are pretty much the same, so there isn't an optimal car to use, which is a great thing. All the different customization is basically cosmetic that does some minor stat tracking. I'm really happy they went this route, because you don't feel obligated to build your car based on some kind of metagame, you can customize it however you like it. 

Besides the season mode being kind of lacking, the only other complaint I had(notice, had), was the online. The first day I had it I couldn't play online at all, it just didn't work, and apparently until Saturday the online was pretty much broken. Thankfully, its been pretty much fixed, but I thought it would be an important point to mention. It is good that the developers showed commitment and actually fixed the problem, though.

Rocket League is an amazing game with addictive gameplay. I don't really get the people that say they don't like sports games, a lot of the gameplay and stat tracking in them is great, and this game is no exception. If your looking for a game to play with friends, or even by yourself that is very competitive based, or even if your just bored and looking for a game to risk $20 on, Give Rocket League a shot, its one of the best games to come out this year. 

Pros:
-Strong gameplay
-Easy to learn, hard to master 
-Plenty of car customization
-No car building meta, you can customize without worry
-Encoranges teamwork
-Reasonable asking price($20)

Cons:
-Lacking season mode could use more stat tracking and player control

												Rocket League is a completely physics-based fast-paced sports game where cars play soccer. A very simple concept, but it's the most fun you could ever have in a video game. The learning curve is very steep, so you might struggle when you begin, but the game's addictive nature will probably grab you anyway and make you play for hours until you're too tired to even go to sleep, so you play more and you realize you've been playing 5 days non-stop and you're dead. Even though it's such a simple idea, there's so much you can do in this game. If you're a newcomer, don't forget to try flying! (Spoiler alert: It's f***ing awesome!)

It also has great potential to become a big e-sports game, something that I'm really looking forward to.

The list of features at the moment isn't huge, but hopefully the devs will add more things in future updates like they've promised. (Psyonix always keeps their promises, so I wouldn't worry about it!) The season mode is a great place for new players to practice their skills against the AI, but the online mode is where most of the fun of the game lies. And, the customization is sick. Oh and the insanely cool replay editor! Also new free maps in the future confirmed!

All in all this game is very solid, very competitive and fun, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes skill-based games or is into sports.


Better than FIFA. 10/10."

												 Rocket League: a synonym to the word ""awesomeness"" I have played many soccer games like PES & Fifa for many years now and i absolutely loved them! and i have played many racing games in the past years but sadly i absolutely hated each one of them! so when i first heard about this game i got confused; how could they mix two things that are totally different (at least for me), and how well could it be? in the end i used my money to buy something else thinking that i'm not gonna like it anyways .. Luckily, they made this free weekend and i finally had the chance to try it out after a long period of waiting and to be honest i got totally amazed! i don't know how to describe the feeling but this game is just great.
 i didn't had the chance to play it for long because i wasted most of my weekend downloading it but here are some positive things about it: (i couldn't find anything bad about it anyways)
+ brilliant idea for a game
+ It's so easy to learn 
+ solid game-play and smooth controlling
+ Beautiful graphics, and it doesn't require a PC gamer to run
+ there is no fancy upgrades or items that gives you extra abilities
+ all the cars have the same speed and abilities, it's all about you and your skills
+ you can make your car look like whatever you want! customize it using your own style
+ full of players, this game is so alive
+ no bugs, no crashed
+ played for 6 hours strait, didn't see a single cheater, and everyone was so nice with me, it's so rare to find such a friendly gaming community nowadays so this is a big up for the game
+ infinity hours of fun 
I'm really glad i tried this gem, i want to give a big thank you to the developers for giving us such a generous chance to try it out
i enjoyed every single moment of the 6 hours i played but unfortunately i don't have enough money at the moments so i guess i'll miss this sale .. for now this game is in the top of my wishlisted games and i'll try hard to get it as soon as possible i can 
for the rest of you out there, i wonder why are you guys still here reading this review? just go buy it now! it's a must have one. 10/10

Edit: as you already know i bought this game and spent more 45 hours playing it, it's absolutely amazing! i'll update this review as soon as i feel i'm ready, stay tuned! :P"

												Rocket League is one of those rare games that oozes love from its developers. 

You will sink hours into this game there is no escaping that. With an amazing multiplayer mode that includes split screen (something sorely missing from too many games today)  that you can take online. Great controls , superb physics . and an additive season mode this game is well worth the $20.

												Rocket League:
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Have you ever imagined in your wildest dreams combining indoor Soccer (Football) and Mattel cars? Well, someone did just that and came up with “Rocket League!” 

Turn on your engine and jump into a 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3 or even a 4 vs 4 online to score the goal of the season! It is just a mad house this game and I would strongly recommend to go through the tutorial to give you the heads up. 

Use your power up to pick up speed and launch your car into the air attempting a 360 degree frontward flip and strike this huge ball at the perfect angle to score a goal. But wait, your teammates are trying to do exactly the same thing and you all miss the ball! Now you have to drive back to defend your own net and hope that your opponents are as skilful as you are. 

You will accumulate points by scoring goals, clearing the balls, passing the ball in the centre, making an assist or, like myself, manage to do a hat trick. And to be honest, it was a fluke! Still, I managed to be the man of the match! Sorry, let me rephrase that -  I managed to be the car of the match! These points will help you to unlock new cars, wheels, paints, hats(???). Yes hats and other stuff.

The graphics are very good and the gameplay is fantastic. Great physics!

One small downside is the frequent connection issue. I do not get kicked out of the game but keep missing out my goal of the season!

Positives:
~~~~~~~  

-	Great graphics and physics
-	Easy to access an online game
-	Innovative and fun to play
-	Trading cards
-	Achievements

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~  

-	Frequent connection issue 

Whoever came up with this idea is a mad genius!

10/10 (even with the connection issue)

												It's like soccer: Because, you know... it's soccer.
It's like Civilization: ""just one more turn/match"". You will find yourself up way later than you were planning.
It's like racqueball: Even if you suck, it is fun as hell just hitting the ball around and trying new stuff.
It's like skateboarding: Tricks accomplished through precise movement and timing.

It's so easy (and fun) to pick up and learn. It's so satisfying to begin hitting harder and harder shots. It is a blast at every point in the learning curve (which seems to extend into infinity)."

												A piece of really addictive game, definitely can make you more nervous than any other game and can test your either physical or psychical skills. 

Do you enjoy flying? Do you enjoy football? Or maybe driving? All of those listed? This is the right game for you.

400 hours on record, yet learning and learning. This is a game for a looooong walk.


Unique idea, made in the best possible way it could be done."

												Demolition Derby meets Soccer/Football/HOOPS. Bought it during a sale, and I was not expecting to have this much fun with this game. I may suck, but it's still a great experience. Nailing those goals can be very satisfying.

Skin and car design options are limited initially, but greatly increases as you play, even if you lose a match."

												Rocket League...The game that took the gaming scene by surprise. Personally, I don't enjoy car games, racing games, or sports games. Especially not soccer. Then why does this game interest me so much?

I have no idea. 

Nevertheless, I haven't been able to play hardly any other games for my newfound love for thrust sticks attached to what look like toy cars. You'll start out jump-flipping into the ball, and being amazed at how you hit it just right to make your first goal. Then you'll experiment with boosting after you jumped. ""I hit it!"" you say. Finally, you were able to touch the ball while it soars 50 feet above the ground. As you cascade to the field, you realize that the death-defying acrobatic maneuver was just enough to tip the ball into your goal"

												Game was fun, this last patch has destroyed the competitive mode. Its randomly throws people in it. They have forced bad maps into the competitive matches and its just ruined the spirit of it all.

												Rocket League is a physics-based vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in July 2015, with a version for Xbox One and beta versions for OS X and Linux being released in 2016. A physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One began being distributed by 505 Games in June 2016.

This game is really fun, it gives hours of fun with or without your friends, it varies in game modes such as football (soccer) basketball and ice hockey, my personal favourite has got to be soccer, you can spend hours perfecting your touch of the game, by improving ariel strikes, ground striking, goalkeeping, it's endless. It is filled with a great community which can make you a lot of new friends! Once you've gotten better and played a lot at perfecting your touch, you can play more competetive by playing ranked, it's like normal but obviously harder and more competetive. I would definetly recommend this, it has hours of fun, which seems to never end being fun. I would give this a 9/10, it's very fun and I hope to play more."

It's been a long time since I've seen people obsess so much over a game. I also love that watching someone play is just about as much fun as playing yourself! Lots of nailbiters and last minute saves. I can't wait to dive in to the PC version."

												A fun and refreshing soccer gameAlthough this game is not the first time where cars and soccer have been put into the same game, this is a refreshing game to many that feels like something new. It is a game with a simple concept, it is loads of fun as so many things can happen in a match that makes it exciting every time, such as an epic save or goal. Playing with friends is definitely recommended as i find its the way to play that i found brings the most fun, but if you solo queue it is still exciting. The controls in the game are simple to use and playing with a keyboard is very doable. This game is definitely worth the price and will bring many hours of fun!"

												score in your own goal when playing with friends

steal speedboost while driving in circles and do nothing else.

call every enemy goal a ''lucky'' goal,

see a friend go for the ball and make a possible goal, drive in advance and give the ball a slight nudge and steal the goal.

play goalkeeper and cuss at your friends for not making 1 goal for 4 minutes, then go out of your goal to help them and enemy scores

so many ways to troll,
supports ps4 controller completely! just plug and use"

												It brings back a simpler time in gaming, no DLC, no content hidden behind other paywalls.

The game has an extremely high skill ceiling and there is tons of nuances to learn to get better at the game; and as someone who intends to play this competitively, there is truely no other title in existance that'll push your skills to the absolute limit in ESL Open tournaments.

10/10 Would Detonate enemies to win!"

Thank you Angry Joe! So glad I follow all of his episodes at times like this! :D

Original and ridiculously fun. Just the fact that it's original says a lot. Trying to be original these days is basically impossible, but here it is, in all its glory.

Cars + Soccer = I didn't realize I liked soccer till now!

9/10 - RECOMMENDED!

												This game is a jewel, the developers were able to mix a simple game with a very competitive background, the fun is guaranteed at short bursts of 5 minutes per gameplay, the more you play, the better you get at it, but it doesn't really matter because the matchmaking system really does it work, and puts you against people that has the same skill as you, being always a fair game (Except if a retard teammate decides to leave for no reason at the start of the game).

I find myself playing it daily, it doesn't make you have bad feelings like CS:GO does, for example (800 hours on record, and I'm sick of the game by now), if you were thinking about picking this game up, do it now, you are able to create a party with your friends and play ranked, where you get points via winning, and lose points via losing, in a simple yet smart way of categorizing players, unranked, where nothing really matters, or a private match, to mess around with boths or without bots, as I said before, fun guaranteed. This is my choice as game of the year.

Enjoy!

PS: When you're looking at the store page, you can't miss the DLCs being there, but don't start thinking about them as a stupid, greedy move made by the developers, the game is cheap, so are the DLCs, they just add cars (Every car is almost the same, they're totally balanced and equal), antennas, wheels, boost ""skins"", and other aesthetic stuff. They're not necessary in any way, but I'm buying them all to support the developers, and because they're worth the price."

												Rocket League is a physics based football type game(no I will not call it soccer). It is actually a sequel to a game called Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars.  Rocket League was released in early July 2015 on the PC and PlayStation 4. 

The gameplay is very simple, you control a rocket powered car and you use it to play a game of football. To many this may sound boring and unfun if you aren't a fan of either cars, or football - let me reassure you though, even if you aren't a fan, I guarantee you will have fun whilst playing Rocket League. The game is highly addictive and it will keep you playing until the early hours of the morning with that ""Just one more match"" feel to it. 

Rocket League has a single player mode, an online multiplayer mode and a local multiplayer mode. I haven't played the single player as the multiplayer is completely where the action is at. The match making system works flawlessly, you will not have any problems finding a game, as of right now there are over 20,000 people playing. Each match lasts 5 minutes, and can consist of teams of 1, 2, 3 or 4 people. Personally I enjoyed the more hectic type matches of 3 or 4. Another nice little bonus is that Rocket League also works cross-platform, meaning you could end up being in a match with PS4 players which is one of the first I've seen run this type of system. 

The controls are very simple, and you can pick them up in a matter of seconds.It is highly recommended that you play this game with a controller though, I have not heard any success stories of people using keyboard and mouse to play. 

Graphically, Rocket League is an awesome game to look at, just the right amount of lens flare, smooth animations and gorgeous looking backgrounds and arenas to play in. The game is ran using Unreal Engine 3, and it has been pushed to look stunning. 

I wouldn't exactly say Rocket League to be a difficult game, it has a very pick up and play vibe to it, but it will take you a couple of hours to become a real asset to your team mates, rather than just driving back and forth on the map chasing the ball. 

I have been playing Rocket League for almost six hours now, I am by no means a master at this game, and it feels as if I am only scratching the surface of the skill level you can reach. Like I said, this game is highly addictive, you will really struggle to put it down after you boot it up. The fast paced action and quick matches keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. 

This game runs as smooth as a babies bottom, the 60 fps, high resolutions and customize-able graphics make this a really PC game that is highly worth your time.' We are looking at one of the games of the year right here. 

 Tom's Score Card
1) Stay away
2) Only recommended when on sale
3) Recommended
4) Highly recommended
5) This is a must play

												I've put in near 200 hours between the PS4 version and this one.  It's very easy for anyone to pick it up and play, but the depth of the mechanics of the game offer a wide range of skilled players.  The rounds are quick as well, so you don't have to sink a major time investment into the game at any time.  The perfect multiplayer game."

												Lets start off by saying this.
If you go to the negative reviews, all you'll find is people saying...

1. ""It's laggy"" - Which used to be true, when this game was first released the servers couldn't handle 100'000's of people at once, so it lagged A LOT, but since then it's gotten a LOT better and a LOT smoother. You'll end up in a laggy match 1/50 times probably. You can also report the server you lagged in online and they'll fix it asap

2. ""My computer won't run it"" - You'll need a decent enough computer to run this game. 

3. ""I suck at this game"" - Keep Practising, trust me, EVERYONE is terrible at this game when they first play it, it's a really unique game which has never been done before so no one really knows how to play, but the more hours you put the better you get, until you start flying in the air constantly and scoring goals from the sky!

4. ""After 30 minutes, you've seen everything and it's just the same thing over and over"" - This is true. There's a lot of maps but they're all identical besides cosmetic changes. All the cars drive Almost the same way and the goal is to shoot the ball into the goal. It's better to compare it to a game like League of Legends or CSGO, you'll do the same thing over and over, but you'll but sooo many hours into it since it's fun.

The game itself is, put simply, Really really fun, any youtube video of other people playing the game will show you this. The basic description for the gameplay is you defend, dribble the ball, FLY around the map going for the ball in the sky. Save goals, gain boosts to use a boost to drive faster and higher, drive up walls to help reach a ball mid-air and try your best to score. 

There's also a lot of customisation for your car including Different types of Cars, Decal's, Antena's, Paints, different coloured cars and for those TF2 fans HAT's. There's unranked 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 gamemodes aswell as ranked 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 gamemodes (4v4 isn't considerd competitive as it's too chaotic to plan anything out), playing with a good team-mate is what really makes this game great. It's a good game to laugh and casually have fun with a friend aswell as a great E-Sports material game for those who want a competitive game (and it is competitive, a major e-sports tournement has already been held and it's amazing)

It's cheap and you'll definitly get your money's worth, as of writing this I have 168 hours into the game and I'm not slowing down."

												Probably one of the most fun and addictive game that came out in a long, long time. Very simple game, fun mechanics and lots of depth for advanced players. Add your friends to the mix and you got some really good stuff.

EDIT BELOW:

The greatest game ever just gets better. Psyonix has really just listened to the community over and over and over and provided/fixed/added pretty much all we've wanted thus far.

I just can't get enough of this game, it's been a blast and still is and I don't see myself stopping any time soon. Their support for the game as well as the crate funded tournaments will be sure to keep this game going for years to come and I, for one, cannot wait to see what they add next.

A game made even better when you play with friends both online or offline."

												With only 200+ hours put into this game so far, it never gets boring, played on your own or with a group of friends each match feels different. Not to mention It feels just as fun as the first match you played when you first purchased the game. I always find myself saying ""Just one more match"" when really I find myself another 30 minutes into it. Its just one of those games that your hooked to the moment you press launch. 

In Rocket League, customisation is a big part of this game with such a large variety of items. You will tend to find yourself saying before a match ""No wait! Dont play yet, I want to fix my car up quickly before we start!"" Especially now with the release of the Champion Crate series its made it just that much more interesting with the amount of newer items available. 
 
Overall I just think this game is fantastic and I feel it can only get better and better with time. 

I've nominated this game for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" Award where I think alot of us who play this game, will agree it deserves this award."

												Physics? - Amazing.

Team based? - Hell yes.

Fun? - FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, A MILLION TIMES YES!

I actually thought this game would be pretty bland and boring but now when I've gotten it. I think it's amazing. Buy it, don't even hesitate."

												Rocket League is a completely physics-based fast-paced sports game where cars play soccer. A very simple concept, but it's the most fun you could ever have in a video game. The learning curve is very steep, so you might struggle when you begin, but the game's addictive nature will probably grab you anyway and make you play for hours until you're too tired to even go to sleep, so you play more and you realize you've been playing 5 days non-stop and you're dead. Even though it's such a simple idea, there's so much you can do in this game. If you're a newcomer, don't forget to try flying! (Spoiler alert: It's f***ing awesome!)

It also has great potential to become a big e-sports game, something that I'm really looking forward to.

The list of features at the moment isn't huge, but hopefully the devs will add more things in future updates like they've promised. (Psyonix always keeps their promises, so I wouldn't worry about it!) The season mode is a great place for new players to practice their skills against the AI, but the online mode is where most of the fun of the game lies. And, the customization is sick. Oh and the insanely cool replay editor! Also new free maps in the future confirmed!

All in all this game is very solid, very competitive and fun, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes skill-based games or is into sports.


Better than FIFA. 10/10."

												A fun and refreshing soccer gameAlthough this game is not the first time where cars and soccer have been put into the same game, this is a refreshing game to many that feels like something new. It is a game with a simple concept, it is loads of fun as so many things can happen in a match that makes it exciting every time, such as an epic save or goal. Playing with friends is definitely recommended as i find its the way to play that i found brings the most fun, but if you solo queue it is still exciting. The controls in the game are simple to use and playing with a keyboard is very doable. This game is definitely worth the price and will bring many hours of fun!"

												The great thing about the beautiful game is that it's a very basic concept: Get the ball into the goal. Video games have put various spins on that concept with great results, and Rocket League joins that list.

You drive a car straight out of Speed Racer. It's got jump jacks and jet engines that you can actually use to fly for a brief period. It drives great. You can even drive along the wall. Drifting is as simple as holding down a button. Easy to use camera controls and UI elements make sure that you know where the ball is. The presentation is amazing and can get you hyped very easily. The game itself is simple to learn but with the boost system there are some very advanced techniques to figure out. Multiplayer supports 4-player splitscreen as well as 8-player online, even both at the same time. And if you're playing by your lonesome, the AI players can keep you company. Did I forget to mention this game also has crossplay with the PS4 version?

Rocket League is excellent and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's enjoyed arcade-style sports games like NBA Jam or NHL 3-on-3 Arcade."

												Oh god, where do I start with this game?

Rocket League.... a football game, with cars!

A straightforward design that doesn't need much explanation.

There are a metric butt ton of modes, the game has great music, and cool car customisation (including my home flag, Australia, wohoo!)

The ranking system is equitable and keeps you playing to progress to the next level. 

Game is insanely fun, there is a wide range of customisations that does not have an effect on the car (no advantages wohoo! +1 on that)

- Server occasionally disconnects me.

This game is great to play on when you're ?#@*&%! at another game, great game to chill out on.

Awesome game, must buy"

												As a competitive gamer, it's not often I'm able to find a game that continues to be enjoyable while I'm getting getting completely dominated; but Rocket League delivers that perfectly. I've played for almost 400-hours and I have yet to figure out why, exactly, this game is so fun to so many different people from so many walks of life. But whatever the reason, Psyonix has delivered a near-flawless hybrid cross between a Single-Character-Controlled Sports game (Soccer, Hockey, Basketball), a Racing game, a Flying game, and a competitive multiplayer experience.

Pros:
- Replayability is consistent.
- Servers cover /many/ regions. (Most of the world.)
- No single Battlecar has a distinct advantage in all fields over every other Battlecar. (There are pros and cons to every Battlecar.)
- Battlecar customizability feels endless.
- Fun for casual gamers.
- Fun for competitive gamers.
- Quick 5-minute matches so you aren't forced to risk losing after 45-minutes.
- Split-screen playable Local OR Online.
- Psyonix listens to players and integrates desired features.
- This Pros list could go on and on.

Cons:
- Not the easiest game to just pick up and play.
-- New players may become discouraged by having difficulty hitting the ball at all. (Don't give up! You'll get it down relatively quickly!)
- Online players can be incredibly rude (as with any online multiplayer game).
- It takes a LOT of time to become a skilled player.
- In-game voice chat quality is unbearable. (Most players use third-party VoIP programs to avoid this issue.)

It has been years since I've found a game that has me as addicted and dedicated as I am to Psyonix's Rocket League. This is a game I'll be playing for a long, long time.

9.5/10


EDIT: Paid DLC is not completely cosmetic, as DLC Battlecars have different hitboxes and turn radiuses than base cars. This, however, does not make any paid DLC Battlecar specifically better than base Battlecars. Every Battlecar has its pros and cons between hitboxes and turn radiuses."

												Rocket League is one of my most recommended games for steam users as it is is just a necessity. It is one of those games that must be part of any collection even with it being relatively new still, and has amazing replayability. 
Even with around 250 hours in game, I still feel experienced enough to say that with a mixture of gameplay styles and techniques to try such as aerials; it makes the game much more fun than it appears at first view. It's not just a demolition derby football game, it has a diverse set of mechanics which makes it differ from any other game and unique in it's own way. 
It does help to play with friends, but playing by yourself is also just as good. Playing with friends means funny muck ups and great goals are even better as you get to share them with people who are enjoying the game as much as you, and makes for great experiences, but by yourself is just as good sometimes.
The concept behind the game is so simple yet can be difficult to master when compared with footage with really good players who harness their car's ability to move in different ways for the advantage, but then that is just more reason to play the game to become better and learn how to score goals in different ways."

												This game man this game is the juice everything you could all want and serving up to its purpose of entertainment unlike any other game.

Menu
It's the best i have seen so far it's easy as hell to navigate through and pretty next-gen as well stylish.

Music 
It's perfect suits the game in every single way there are a wide variety and most of them being electronic it's easy to listen to and enjoyable at the same time just perfect.

Gameplay 
It's fun as damm and playing football/soccer with cars really who wouldn't want that? And the best part of all FIFA has nothing to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to do with it. Wide variety of moves and it never feels unfair due to every car having the same states just different hitboxes which I doubt make a difference at all.

Controls 
The control's here are silk as smooth response as hell man just perfect response easy to get the hang of it. Many say this game is better with playing with a ""controller"" but it's not necessary with keyboard it's all fine just takes a little while to get the hang of it.

Split screen 
Yes there's split screen multiplayer and offline split screen. You are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ kidding me right are you? No I'm not it really really has spilt screen going up to 4 players just amazing just amazing I have yet to see this in any new game and yet rocket league does it like a B.0.S.S.

Customization 
Customization does not serve any purpose in gameplay it's all cosmetic effect but really who doesn't like it?

I mean making your car fire rainbows and all that ♥♥♥♥ up your ♥♥♥.

In all seriousness it's down right amazing just perfect you unlock a cosmetic item every time you complete a match there are 150 cosmetic items/effects in total and more going up in future.

Conclusion 
The hell are you waiting for and buying all those Early Access ""Survival"" games huh really?

Just stop it really just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stop it and buy rocket league only 20 dollars man cheaper then all the canes of beers you just bought today.

A simple idea but done right. amazing and fun to play. polished around the corner. great sound's and ost. matching environments and nice graphics.

												Update 1The new map ""Aqua Dome"" is incredibly resource-intensive: I usually play RL on fairly low settings without lags or framerate drops, but this map seems to require an enormously better hardware. It is constantly lagging and the framerate drop makes this map unplayable. I do not really see, why it was necessary to implement a map with significantly higher graphic requirements: Basically, I have to leave every other game. 

Update 2 Same goes for Starbase ARC.

Update 3 You might have guessed it already: Same goes for the new Dropshot map. It performs slightly better than Aquadome. 


ENGLISH: I absolutely enjoyed playing this game, for it has an interesting gameplay (soccer = cool, racing = cool, both combined = awesome). 
What I particularly dislike and what made it hard to be fun is the community, especially in 'Ranked' mode: Usually you end up with a special someone who enjoys ruining the other player's game and therefore their rank: Constantly crashing his teammate on purpose, scoring own goals, swearing or spamming. While you can report these people, all of them state, that they get reported 10 times/day and they do not have to face any consequences at all. 
If Psyonix solves this issue, playing will be fun again. If not, I will have to stick to teaming up with a steam friend who is not a total ♥♥♥♥. 
Offline/AI games are no alternative: The bots seem to be demanding enemies when you start playing, but soon, when you reach a certain skill level, they become rather unchallenging pushovers.

DEUTSCH: Mir hat das Spiel immer sehr gefallen, es hat ein wirklich interessantes Gameplay (Fussball = cool, Autos = cool, beides zusammen = wahnsinnig gut).
Was ich wirklich hasse und was meiner Meinung nach den Spaß versaut hat, ist die Community, besonders im ""Ranked"" Modus: Normalerweise wird man mit irendeinem Spezialisten gepaart, der es unglaublich toll findet den Anderen das Spiel und damit auch den Rank zu versauen: Dauerhaftes Rammen des Teamkollegen, Eigentore, Beleidigungen und Rumgespamme. Natürlich kann man die Leute inzwischen auch melden, aber nach Aussage dieser Leute, hat das selbst bei täglichen Meldungen keine Auswirkungen. 
Wenn Psyonix das irgendwie in den Griff bekommt, macht Spielen auch wieder Spaß. Wenn nicht, muss ich mit einem meiner Steamfreunde, die keine Idioten sind, zusammen spielen. 
Offline-Spiele gegen die KI sind auch keine wirkliche Alternative: Die Bots scheinen am Anfang wirklich hartnäckig zu sein,  sobald man aber den Dreh raus hat, spielt man auch die ""Allstars""-Bots mit 8:0 an die Wand."

												Do you have 5 minutes to play a match of Rocket League? Just five minutes of fast, exciting, and competitive action. Three hours later, you’ll find time for another match. Rocket League is a fantastic multiplayer game with simple mechanics and a tremendous learning curve. It is easy to play and hard to master. You drive a rocket car and hit a ball into a goal. On a basic level it requires timing hits, simple passing, and good positioning. More advanced techniques include aerials, dribbling and pinching. Hitting goals is satisfying but you are always searching for that perfect match with good cooperation. With many skills to master, it is a game that provides reward after many hours. While there is some luck involved, such as when balls are contested, skill usually wins out. Rocket League is a game of exceptional value and you only need 5 spare minutes."

												10/10 ­- I Hate Racing Games, I Hate Soccer Games; I LOVE Them Together!

I never like reviewing games that everyone has played but I must check this off the list and get it done! Rocket Leauge is one of the most impressive games to come out in the last few years in my humble opinion. The replay value is nuts; you can keep playing almost indefinitely without getting bored. There is a pretty big learning curve but once you get the hang of things the rewards are great!

This game is a soccer game but instead of sending troops into battle you send 3­4 cars into the arena! What could possibly make this better?! How about strapping rockets onto the back of your ride! There is a great deal of skill involved but even if you suck you will have tons of fun. I have worked my way from easy to hard on single player and I felt like my skills were pretty solid, winning most matches. I quickly realized though I’m still not that good; other players are always better and the difference in skill levels are vast! So don’t be discouraged when you start getting whooped on multiplayer!

Overall, this is a real gem! Make sure you computer is strong enough for multiplayer because it will definitely use more resources. You can often find this game for about $15 now so lookout for that deal!

If you like racing games and Soccer you will have a lot of fun in that game.

Jump, shoot goals, try to keep the ball away from your goal or just dont try to do an owen goal xD

Music is good, atmosphere is better then in fifa or pes,  graphic and stadions looks pretty nice too, nice color and so.

												edit: I wrote this prior to becoming an employee at Psyonix

Let me start by saying that I have been playing the preview of this game since June 26th, I also was a part of the alpha in 2014 and part of multiple betas.

Simply said, this game is the most fun that may ever exist. You find yourself constantly saying 'Just one more game' over and over and over again because you literally cannot just put it down. It's simple: a car arena like showdown on a soccer field with one giant ball and a bunch of boost to fill your rocket powered dreams, but don't be fooled because this game is much deeper than it will originally look. Psyonix takes a very simlpe core idea and allows us to do whatever we want with it because of its purely physics based gameplay. 

What does this give us though? Let me tell you. Satisfyingly tight controls, action packed multiplayer, awe inspiring aerial goals, sniper tactics, competitive and casual matchmaking, hours of laughing and enjoyment, TONS of explosions (Mr. Torgue aproved), an incredibly balanced game, all future maps will be free, PC to PS4 crossplay, over 150 items for purely cosmetic customizations, and over 10billion of said combinations. 

I can really only say so much about the game itself (partly because English was my worst course :P) but what I really cannot stress enough is that you won't be staying for just the game alone. You'll be seeing Psyonix as one of the only developers left that actually understand what we want as well as falling in love with the community. 

The community of Rocket League (and SARPBC for that matter) is probably the most open, friendly and supportive community I have come accross. Of course this is being said before release and I really hope that you new players please uphold our standard of ingame complements, willingness to help out anyone that wants to learn, and general good sportsmanship. If you find yourself running into a few bad apples, don't worry about it, as you climb up the ladder into the ranks with the rest of the long time players you'll notice the warmer atmosphere to say the least :)

Now I suppose I should say that within the last week I've apparently played nearly 90hrs and that's just playing private matches with the same people constantly. Some would think that I'd be bored after that, but you'd be so so wrong. I can play all day, get into bed and watch some Rocket League videos, and then immediately want to play more (I may or may not be addictive :| but don't think you're immune).

Anyways, I'm going to play some more Rocket League. I hope to see you on the field, and remember... Nice shpt! And never let the ball touch the ground (Rule #1)"

												Edited as of: 21st July 2015 01:00

Pros:
+ Its a football/soccer game that contains rocket powered cars (added soccer because of americans).
+ It is purely a skill based game and everything the player does matters.
+ (in my experience) my game seems to run at a stable 60FPS after turning off the frame limiter.
+ Graphics looking quite nice.
+ PC, PS4 cross play is possible.
+ Its easy to learn, Impossible to master.
+ Ranking system currently works well with score gained or lost each match.
+ There are a lot of friendly players in the steam community.
+ Save replays after matches and edit them to your hearts content in the editor
+ Full xbox 360/xbox one controller support

Cons:
- PS4, PC cross parties are currently non-existant
- You can unlock a lot of things in such a small time, I'm level 20/30 and I have 100% of the items
- Some people have crashing issues (mainly NVIDIA DRIVER ISSUES, I run AMD so I do not have these issues myself)
- Lower ranks may take a large time for even skilled players to get out of due to solo 3v3 treating everyone the same
- You cannot communicate to PS4 players except for a small amount of pre-determined chat commands
- Voice codec is rather terrible, so advice is to use out of game communication

Middle:
= Servers are pretty much sorted now, the occasional lag spike will happen at peak times though
= Currently no spectator system
= NO PEER TO PEER, so even private matches require servers to be up
= 4v4 is the limit, (some people see that as good, some as bad)
= Any controller other than xbox may require some outside support or some other sort of executable

That is as fair as I can be to it, if I missed anything out, tell me.

TL:DR, I think its a good game from my experience :D

												Rocket League is, as description claims, a sequel to a PS3 game with an overly complicated title that probably contributed to the fact that not many people have heard about it. Neither have I, so when I watched a video of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, I was surprised to learn that Psyonix basically got the whole formula down with their first attempt; mechanics have hardly changed since the first entry into what might be now considered a sort of a franchise. 

That Rocket League is now enjoying far more success than its predecessor is very clear. Some of it may be down to the good timing since it doesn't have to compete with any AAA behemoth, some to PS+ free release and its very important strength: it is highly watchable and thus enjoyed free promotion from streamers and youtube personalities. But it doesn't fully explain the explosion of entusiasm it garnered. 

I think the main reason is that it's almost a perfect execution of its idea. It's addictive, but demanding. Fun from the getgo, but surprisingly deep in terms of its mechanics. If you have all these elements and add polish the result is an extremely engrossing competitive online game. 
You start off by simply attempting to hit a ball, preferably in the direction of the enemy's goal, but in the beginning every hit feels like a success. As you learn to have more control over the car, which thanks to the tactile responsiveness of controls happens at a rather quick pace, you find yourself mixing in more advanced techniques to gain the edge over the enemy. Occasionally you will manage to pull off an impressive move and you will want that to make this a norm. Once you get your technique down to an acceptable level it's no longer enough: you need to ""read the pitch"", predict your opponents' moves, cooperate with your teammates (or not, if you choose to play only 1v1 which you're entirely free to do!). 

This aspect of the game is hard to overstate.  Playing Rocket League constantly demands and leaves room for improvement, both individual and team-based and given that player base is currently huge and matchmaking great, you're going to matched against players just right for you. 
 There is always one caveat that applies to every online game in existence: your mileage may vary. If you're unlucky, you may very well have unpleasant experience with it. You might end up with a series of online problems or bugs. You might very well not be so drawn in by the mechanics or be in the minority of people this game doesn't resonate with. But I say: buy. It's unlikely any of it will apply to you, and if the price is the only source of doubt for you, wait for the first sale and get it then, though in my opinion it's well worth the price of admission."

												Amazingly fun game that has all the fun elements of FIFA without the tedious bits.

If you've seen videos of Rocket League and think ""gee that would be hard to learn"" you're wrong and you're right. It's very easy to pick up but to pull off crazy aerials is hard and will take many, many hours to master.

The matchmaking service seems to work quite well and it's quick so if it does get things wrong and puts you in a game which is too easy or too hard it's not a big deal to look for another match.

Best to play with at least one friend so you can 2v2 others without having to deal with team mates dropping out or rage quitting.

I waited for it to be on sale but honestly it's worth full price. Hell I would happily have paid $50 for it. It's that fun."

												Rocket League is a great game. The core mechanics are fun and very well executed. Currently the servers don't work and I haven't been able to play online. I would easily reccomend this game for the single player alone. The only real concern I have is that it may not offer enough content to keep the community alive for any significant length of time.  

Edit* Servers are working now.

												Soccer with Cars!

PROS:

>A wonderfully made sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars with much better graphics, mechanics, and new content

>Psyonix took a very simple idea and made something wonderful with it. Rocket League truly is the easy to learn - hard to master game that the more you play the better you become

>Rocket League is constantly watched by its developers who update the game periodically and always deliver new free and DLC content (All DLC for this game is only cosmetic which delivers a much better experience for those who want more and doesn't effect those who don't decide to pick up the DLC)

>Rocket League provides a competitive and casual playlist for those who wish to either play for  #1 on the leaderboards or jump into a few matches here and there


>Unlike other sports games where you press a button to do an action, in Rocket League you actually have to learn moves and tricks. You control the direction of your car and how you play each and every match


CONS:

>At times I find competitive matchmaking to be off to where you get matched with players way below your skill level and sometime players way above your skill level

>Although Rocket League provides a fun and awesome experience, you don't get the full experience playing alone. I suggest picking up Rocket League with a couple of friends to make it more interesting


FINAL VERDICT:

If you do get the chance to pickup Rocket League with a few friends I suggest you do so. For 20 dollars you can't go wrong for the amount of hours you an your friends will pour into Rocket League"

Rocket League review
I don't really enjoy playing football/racing games (or just any sports game in general), but for some reason when you blend the two together, you get a really fun game! I've honestly been doubtful to get this one, but don't have any regrets buying it - not even after playing it on and off for a good year.

After first being introduced to it by watching E3, I told myself to keep this game in mind because I might want to buy it sometime in the (distant) future. A little bit later, checking out some twitch as usual, this game was just everywhere. So I watched some streams and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Much more than I had anticipated. So eventually I decided to just buy this game and give it a go. I have to say it's been long since I bought a game at full price, but it has been totally worth it. 

What I like

+ Gameplay is VERY enjoyable: intense, hilarious, chaotic and rageworthy
+ Easy to learn, hard to master
+ Tutorial + training areas!
+ Matches are short (5 minutes), making it ideal for casual players also
+ You don't need friends for this game, however I do recommend playing with them
+ AI (computer controlled) cars are pretty decent
+ Car customization!
+ Game looks gorgeous
+ Some nice catchy tunes that totally get you into the mood for some intense Racing/football
+ It's best played with a controller, but mouse and keyboard do work fine too
+ Price tag is about right

What I don't like

- Fairly toxic community at times (hence why I recommend to play with friends)
- AI cars (not always so decent)

Conclusion

Overhyped? Maybe, but all in all, a very enjoyable game. Whether you just want a quick 20 min break or a long 3- hour session, it's all up to you. One thing is for sure: you'll have fun. That is, if you don't take the game too seriously."

												For something as simple as soccer/football played with turbo-powered cars, Rocket League is way more in-depth and entertaining than it might appear on the surface. Fast-paced, clean-looking, and hard not to enjoy even when you're losing or making embarrassing mistakes, this game will give you plenty of moments where you're geeking out over some incredible shot, save, or block - and it will give you just as many moments of intense, stress-inducing close calls or just-barely-missed opportunities.

Played like a much smaller (player-wise) version of soccer/football - with several variations like 1 vs 1, 3 vs 3 (the standard), 4 vs 4, etc. - Rocket League is an interesting mix of competitive sports and driving/racing, pitting players against each other on two teams in five minute matches. An interesting twist, however, is the rocket-powered aspect of the cars and the ""boost"" fuel that players have to pick up and manage throughout the match. While it might seem like something strictly used for speed, it plays into essentially every aspect of the game, from controlling yourself in the air to making/blocking shots as well as to take other players out. With both resource management and getting a feel for how the cars control or the ball works, the game can feel very random and chaotic at first, often leaving you feeling like any play you make is chance or luck; to me, however, this is where Rocket League's longevity and replayability really comes into play. 

You might be clueless initially and have no idea what you're doing (yet still manage to make plays), but the game unfolds more and more as you play and get your bearings. While one match you're barely struggling to hit the ball in the air, soon enough you'll hit them every time and come to find that as you practice you have way more control over the game and yourself than the chaotic atmosphere might let on. The high-flying bounces, the impossible-to-save/strike shots - it all will eventually be something you can not only handle consistently, but also open you up to the other techniques in the game like aerial movement/shots and boost control.

Combine the solid gameplay and skill progression with an easy-to-use interface and good soundtrack (which should totally have an option to enable during matches!) and Rocket League is a surprisingly fun, easy-to-play but hard-to-master game that's both something you can pick up every now and then as well as play for hours."

												Do you like soccer?  Do you like cars?  Do you like playing soccer with cars?  

Whoever came up with this idea deserves a freakin cookie.  The game is beautiful, the gameplay is perfect, the community is active and generally pretty fun, and the soundtrack is awesome.  You can customize your cars which is always fun.  Also, cross-platform multiplayer!  PC players and PS4 players all play together, which is always a nice feature.  

10/10 would drive up the arena wall and jump off to aerial ""kick"" the ball into the goal again."

												What to say about Rocket League except the fact that some servers got a really bad ping... In general, it's a very very great game.

The goods : 

- Many differents items and cars
- The gameplay is awesome
- The maps are awesome
- Awesome textures aswell
- 19,99$ isn't that much for a game like this
- I saw an incoming DLC for FREE +rep
- The crowd is like the same when you watch Soccer

The bads :

- The ping on some servers are ♥♥♥♥ sometimes (happen in several games)
- Some people think they're good on ranked but they just need MORE practice and some players can be toxic too (it happens in every community)

My rating for this game is a 8/10"

												The idea is simple. soccer with rc cars that can propell themselves with rockets as boost. Why is it simple ideas with small twists work so flawlessy.

The only negative things about this game are:

- number of arenas is small and same(Would love to see one in the shape of a U/S/N with goals on each end point
- no custom elements for modes other than ranked and number of people (time, score limit, how much boost the pads give, even options on how the ball acts would be nice, etc) 
- get or have a game pad (good luck if you dont)
- prepare to have no life

Positives

- a lot of customization for a $20 game
- purely skill based (nothing in game can give you an edge (other than keyboard/mouse vs gampad)
- With pc and ps4 gamers togeather its a very big player pool for such a small game
- Rocket trails 
- can pick up and play or go for hours on end
- Looks realy good and the style of the game realy fits togeather 
- NOT FTP and NOT riddled with microtransactions (part of the reason why the game is as good as it is)


Ill put is this way, If you even like the idea of soccer and playing the game as cars this is for you and their is much fun to be had 

 I love this game and its concept/execution"

SARPBC (the PS3 predecessor to Rocket League) has been a favorite of my friends and I for... years. Literally years. We've put thousands of hours into it. It's one of those incredibly rare games that all of us are always keen to play because it's always fun. 

Rocket League, I'm happy to say, is SARPBC with improved graphics and gameplay, better accessibility for new players, plus a ton of added options that give the game an extra layer of character. It's going to comfortably replace SARPBC in my top five games, all-time, across all genres. It's also replacing SARPBC as my absolute favorite multiplayer game - online or local. 


Positive

+ Fun, deep, brilliantly fast-paced gameplay
+ Games are long enough to mean something, but short enough that a loss is never too frustrating.
+ Games are almost never over until the final buzzer. Results can turn on a dime - and when they do, it's always because a player or team has stepped up, rather than any fault of or flaw with the game itself. 
+ The learning curve is fairly smooth, but the skill ceiling is also incredibly high. Despite the aforementioned years playing SARPBC, I still see players in Rocket League pulling off moves that I can only dream of.
+ There's massive flexibility in how you play, more than any other game I know of. Offline with bots. Offline split-screen. Online. Online split-screen. Online split-screen with bots. 1 v 1 if you don't feel like playing on a team, or 2 v 2 / 3 v 3 / 4 v 4 if you do. And the game is just as suited to mano-a-mano matches as it is to team play, which is (again) a very, very rare quality.


Negative

- The one slightly disappointing thing I'll mention is (at launch) the lack of variety in maps. SARPBC had a bunch of quite inventive, distinctive maps that forced different play styles and tactics. Rocket League's maps are aesthetically different, but structurally uniform. Luckily, word is that some 'crazier' maps will likely be arriving in the forthcoming free DLC.  I'm still thoroughly enjoying what's already there, but some extra variety in that regard will definitely be welcome.


Conclusion

If the idea of fast-paced soccer (sans rules) with cars even vaguely appeals to you, get this game immediately. It's one I fully expect to still be playing - and thoroughly enjoying - years from now."

												If you want a new type of game, none of that Moba/FPS crap you have played on multiple different games but yet it still feels the same then Rocket League is a new game you can learn and have a bit of fun with. If you think that you won't like this because you hate football then trust me I thought the same thing but as soon as you start trying to jump and hit that ball in the net with your car you are going to forget about what you first thought about the game and love the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. 

-Unique Idea
-DLC Cars look awesome (a bit costly if you hunt achievments as you will need all of the DLC for them)
-Taught me ball control

The only thing I find a bit meh about this game is that you have to spend money on the keys for crates which is alright I guess if you would like a chance at the rare items but not my kind of thing."

												The 10 players you meet in Rocket League :
The Defeatist                :
    The match begins and boom! Within thirty seconds a goal is scored and your team is down 0-1. That's when one player on your team decides it's all over. The lead is insurmountable, the tide is irreversible, the team is unsalvageable. The Defeatist immediately abandons the match to continue the restless search for a team that won't let them down the way you just did.

The Spoiler                  :
   You've just made an amazing, epic save. The ball was 90% inside your goal, glowing like a white dwarf and about to explode, but you somehow manage to bop it out just in the nick of time. And there's The Spoiler, the player on the other team just parked there, three feet away, who simply nudges it back in for a goal, utterly erasing your heroics.

The Archivist                :
   Sometimes you want to watch replays, sometimes you don't. Everyone feels that way except for The Archivist, who never, ever chooses to skip the replays even though they're not even featured in them. Even though everyone else has voted to skip it and get back to playing. C'mon, dude! I accidentally scored on my own goal and don't want to relive it. Press skip! Press skip!

The Hitman                   :
   While most players focus on the ball, some focus on the other players. The Hitman doesn't just demolish other cars when the opportunity presents itself but makes it a personal mission to ram, batter, and destroy you from the opening seconds to the final klaxon. Not a bad strategy, really. If you're hit by this player more than once you'll probably give up on the ball and spend the match looking for a little payback.

The Failed Stuntman          :
   We all know the ball spends about half its time rolling up the side of the arena, and those skilled enough can chase it and make plays while vertical. The Failed Stuntman thinks the same thing, but is entirely wrong. They'll constantly chase ball up and down the wall and never once connect. Just wait for it to land, willya? You're not doing any good up there.

The Only Player On Your Team :
   The ball has been centered and you're in the perfect position to knock it in for a score. But what's this? A teammate flies in backwards, knocking it away from you, off the wall, and back into midfield. It's The Only Player On Your Team, and this driver never, ever stops going for the ball, no matter where it is or who else might be going for it at the same time. As far as this driver is concerned, there's only one player on your team, and it's not you.

The Doorman's Ghost          :
   Praise be to the players who don't always try to score but hang back and protect your team's net. Occasionally a driver will actually spend the entire game playing goalie, which is great! Except for The Doorman's Ghost, who waits patiently between your uprights until the other team takes a shot on goal. At which point he's suddenly somewhere else.

The Benedict Arnold          :
   We've all done it, either by an ill-timed boost or an attempted save or just bad luck: we've all scored on our own goal. The proper behavior in this instance is to spend the rest of the match feverishly trying to make up for it, but not so for the Benedict Arnold. After scoring on their team they'll vanish in a puff of shame, too embarrassed to even attempt redemption.

The Drunken Angel            :
   Aerial skills are both important and rare, and most players won't risk it unless they're lined up perfectly or are desperate for a goal. Except for The Drunken Angel, who rockets into the air the second the ball is off the ground despite never once successfully making a play. In fact, even when the ball isn't in the air, this player is. Some drivers just like to fly.

The Holdout                  :
   You've just had a fun, amazing, hard-fought match with fantastic plays, epic saves, and stunning goals that came down to a lengthy and memorable overtime. Everyone agrees immediately that another game is absolutely necessary. Except for The Holdout, who refuses to ready up. But why? We shared something beautiful! We'll never find each other again! Please, ready up! Ready up before it's too—

the Toxic                    :
   The reason we use the word 'toxic' is very intentional.
   In our observations and research on player behavior, we find that a single source of negative              behavior can ripple through hundreds or thousands of games. For example, let's say we have a game with     6 players--5 are positive, and 1 is negative. The 1 negative player is racist, rages all game, and  intentionally leaves the game. This experience can negatively influence some of the other 5 positive players in the game. Some of these 6 players will play another game of Rocket League and instead of being positive, they might start the game neutral or negative. Their actions can then influence 6 other players in the game, and toxicity spreads. 

A single negative action could result in thousands of games with negative incidences--this is why many of our latest experiments focus on shielding players from toxicity (Restricted Chat Mode -- forcing players to make a decision between using limited chat resources for cooperative communication, or still using it for negative purposes and being message capped), or stemming the spread of toxicity (our next experiment)."

												I've spent 900 hours on this game, which is the most I have ever spent on any game. For 20 dollars this is an insane deal and an incredibly well-crafted game. Highly recommended

Edit: It is hard to believe I wrote this 800 Rocket League hours ago. I have nearly doubled the playtime that I had when I first wrote my review and I still find myself playing regularly. The game has only gotten better since, with the inclusion of more customization options, and soon to be better training options. Psyonix has really listened to the community and are an exemplary model for all game developers. I gave this game my full recommendation 800 hours ago, and I am giving it once again. Rocket League is the best game I have ever played."

												I bought this game when it was really young, it was around a month after release. At the beginning the game was really difficult to play, but after a while you will master it. You should ONLY play this game if you have some kinda controller, cause with Keyboard and Mouse it is almost impossible to play this game. Think about this for yourself and decide if you want to own this game:

- Like to smash cars? BUY IT!
- Like to fly like never before? BUY IT!
- Like racing and football? BUY IT!


I really recommend it. It's the best game I have ever played so far. Why? Almost every month there is a new DLC or update for the game, so it keeps me really exited! 10/10 IGN."

												What I thought was the worst concept EVER (really? Football and Cars together? Come on.. anyone?) ended up being one of the most addictive games I’ve come to cross around.

PROS
-Everyone is on the same page. There is no difference in XP, Cars, Skins or anything. SKILLS are everything
-Very fluid
-No bugs (at least I haven’t found one)
-Multi-Platform
-Coop and Local Coop

CONS
-NO OFFLINE LAN. That kind of sucks… really. This would be a reason to NOT RECOMMEND a good game, but this game is pretty great, so I still give it a recommend (Oh yeah, I wan’t to hear those brats from US and EU talk about how everyone got internet now and we don’t need LAN Anymore, and this is a stupid complain.. please go ahead) 
-Servers give a connection problem all the time. I asked a lot of people, and I am getting the same answer from at least 40% of the people. Maybe is just here in South America, and playing with servers outside the ping goes over 200. The good thing is that the game does not become totally unplayable, especially for new, not all that skilled players (like myself :D)
-No the best Match Making system ever, but this is not a Con per say… just not so great yet I think

But really. Awesome game. Worth the full price. Tell your friends and Rocket!"

												If you're even just slightly interested in arcade racing games and/or football, then you should check this out...well, actually, even if you're not ;)

In Rocket League, you're playing football (or soccer) with cars, with the addition that you have a speed booster and you can jump, which can make for some great moves and aerial shots.
You can choose from 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 Matches, so it's nowhere near as much players as in real football, but that's actually a good thing, even with 4v4 it can get pretty messy and chaotic...then again, that can be fun as well ^^

It's rather easy to get into the game, as you have tutorial for the basics, like handling your booster, doing aerial shots, defense etc. But that doesn't mean there is no challenge. To do those insane aerial maneuvers, you'll need quite some training.

The Main Motivation comes from being a competitive game, either via ranked games or normal matches against other players. There is also a single-player mode, but that's more for practicing and getting into the game than a selling point for the game.
You can also unlock stuff for your car, like hats, booster color, tires and patterns to put onto your car.

I've never been a big fan of either genre, yet Rocket League manages to pull me in and gets me excited about every match i play. Even if you're playing with random people, it's not that bad and you can have quite some fun, though having a good team which is working good together would be the most fun.

So, hope to see some of you on the field :)"

												Rocket-controlled autos flipping through the air in Thunderdome-esque matches of fenced in range soccer sounds like the indiscernible ramblings of a psycho, yet it winds up being sufficiently insane to work. Psyonix's Rocket League, the follow up to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, finds imbecilic fun in pulling turbocharge-fronted flips in a baked good truck, and the white-knuckle framework in working with your social occasion to control the mammoth ball on offense and resistance. The smart and liquid ludicrousness of Rocket League wires into an authentic respectable time – paying little personality to servers that now and again work perfectly. 

The crucial mode puts two social events of three in obviously differing however execution unclear vehicles (however 1v1, 2v2, and 4v4 assortments exist) as they race here and there the pitch looking for after the class' greater than typical likeness a soccer ball. The goliath thing is, you don't have to know anything about driving diversions or soccer to play. The models are basic: drive really energetic around glorious, flickering, neon shaded fields and do bolster traps while trying to crush a never-endingly ricocheting ball into a misleadingly tight space. 

The heart of Rocket League lives in that thought unfathomable change. It's thanks in wide part to the utilization of what I would call ""material science in any case,"" where the laws of gravity and essentialness get a splendid climb to think about driving on the dividers and housetop, and unconventional mid-air heading changes that would condense the driver in this present reality. By the by, its astounding change is so arcadey and fulfilling that I reliably need to remind myself to pump the brakes or lay off the traps when an immediate push or pound will do. 

Furthermore, those traps are the principle surface-scratching look at Rocket League's layer of philosophy under the unmistakably tumultuous squashing of metal. Tapping your ricochet get places you unmistakable all around, where tapping it again with a course held plays out a somersault, barrel roll, or bike kick. It may sound clear – and truly, it is – yet timing a hit to interface with a speeding ball, and controlling the course you send it cruising, down to right edges, takes some expertise. There are genuine, uncommon levels of fulfillment to be tapped when you see an accessory sorting out a shot from the corner and read the condition, pummeling on the brakes to push the ""go"" into the objective with an impeccably masterminded barrel roll. It's electric. 

Outside of the enraged and inebriating gameplay, Rocket League has deficient couple of parts to substance out the experience. The player-advancement structure – where winning matches, performing in-redirection deeds, or doing anything truly, wins you encounter – opens to some degree stable of insane vehicles or therapeutic decals and embellishments. 

It's engaging to drive a truck wearing a sombrero, without question, however since there's in every way that really matters zero mechanical refinement between the dozen or so sportsters, trucks, exotics, a couple thought models and no shy of what one hardened yogurt truck (select to PS4 players), there's no certified estimation improvement that developments how you play a match. Recollecting that is all superbly sensible for a level multiplayer playing field, I would have expected to see every auto go on the qualities and insufficiencies determined by their certifiable accessories: wear autos as snappy however difficult to-handle strikers, trucks and vans as slower yet more grounded guardians, and the adjusted yet all around advantageous roamers some place in the inside. It appears like a missed chance to incorporate a more basic association with your cars in the parking spot, particularly when making a squad to play through a whole season. 

By the by, there is an other advancement twist found in comprehending how to utilize the shocking mechanical noteworthiness of Rocket League's different controls and whimsical material science. Whether that twist takes you through online focused or arranged matches, lovely showcases, up to four-player neighborhood obliging play on split-screen, or each of the 36 weeks of a completely widened season mode, the Rocket League experience is constantly about getting into the going with throttle-pumping match. 

Recalling there are leaderboards to track your bits of learning and general limit, Rocket League servers battle to bolster the converging of PlayStation 4 and PC players seeking after for same and cross-arrange matchmaking sessions, rendering the lion's share of Rocket League's online segments – including the online party structure – spotty, most perfect circumstance. Luckily, the AI is critical on either burden setting above Rookie, both as partners and adversaries, so Rocket League doesn't lose much in a totally separated proximity, which is uncommon, since its online suite is, in a manner of speaking, unsteady. 

Rocket League is a phenomenal circumstance where the execution of a key, over the top accepted is so solid along these lines beguiling that it needn't issue with a monstrous measure of additional parts around it. The surge of tearing over the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on focus with a hold bike kick is sufficient to bring me back on different occasions for only ""one more match,"" even without basic improvement frameworks. Rocket League is a phenomenal, silly, simple to learn and hard to star development sports redirection which requests that you get a few sidekicks and play a few rounds.

												Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...

Rookie - You can't hit ♥♥♥♥. You are a disgrace to your team and the game.

Semi Pro - You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still ♥♥♥♥.

Pro - You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller, ♥♥♥♥-head.

Veteran - You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!

Expert - You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.

Master - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam ""Sorry!"" every time they do something wrong to you.

Legend - The most badass-looking title you can have. ♥♥♥♥ Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""

Rocketeer - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag, but if you didn't: Still prepare for another endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Rocketeer!""

But in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole-nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)

If you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review, just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA). 
Think about it this way: You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game. Ignore the childish-looking pictures on the store page. Just get this game. This is the one.

EDIT - 2/13/2016: You know a game is amazing when the servers go down and you'd rather train offline than play any of your other 100 games...

The game has a indepth tutorial to get you started off on your all-star career, and the game even offers a season mode which will rank you against other players.

												Right of the bat you should know EA has nothing to do with this game, so there is only one outcome: a fantastic game.

Psyonix is one of those team of developers that implement what ""we"" want to see in their game , and I absolutely love it.

Rocket league may seem easy to play but its very hard to master and the skill cap is almost nowhere to be found, after as of 300 hours I am still learning things!

Simple, addictive, fun, casual games, ranked games, fun (mutator settings) games, local co-op, split screen, you name it, RL has it, and the good part, new things kepp coming!
The DLCs are high quality and at a very reasonable price and you dont even have to buy them, its just aestethics and maybe a new car here and there. wattttt

I hope I made this game some justice with this review, so follow my advice and give it a Nice shot!

It's a ton of fun, the AI was well made and actually gives you a decent fight at higher levels, and the awesome trick shots you can attempt (and in my case mostly miss) are fun all day long."

												It's super fun, it's a blast with friends, and there's splitscreen multiplayer for a PC game for once. I love this game and I already bought a shirt with the logo.

If you have a dual monitor set-up, I recommend you look into changing the game's resolution to span both screens for 2-player. The UI scales perfectly and you'll each have your own full-screen view!"

												Right of the bat you should know EA has nothing to do with this game, so there is only one outcome: a fantastic game.

Psyonix is one of those team of developers that implement what ""we"" want to see in their game , and I absolutely love it.

Rocket league may seem easy to play but its very hard to master and the skill cap is almost nowhere to be found, after as of 300 hours I am still learning things!

Simple, addictive, fun, casual games, ranked games, fun (mutator settings) games, local co-op, split screen, you name it, RL has it, and the good part, new things kepp coming!
The DLCs are high quality and at a very reasonable price and you dont even have to buy them, its just aestethics and maybe a new car here and there. wattttt

I hope I made this game some justice with this review, so follow my advice and give it a Nice shot!

												Rocket League is a well-made mix between racing and soccer genre. If you are subscribed to any of gaming Youtube channels or websites, you are probably already familiar with the game and you know that there is quite a lot of hype about it. And that hype is not unjustified.
If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end. 

What is happening in the game:You are in control of a car and your mission is to score enough goals to win the match with other players. You can play multiplayer (with actual people) or singleplayer (with bots). Also, there is a freeplay mode for you to sharpen your skills.

Pros:    The way this game looks is astonishing. Grass, cars, turbo effects, the ball, the arena ... they really look good. I mean, look at the Store page screenshots!
    Multiple game modes for both online and offline playing (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4). Ranked cannot be 4v4, however. If you play on ""Unfair"" difficulty against bots, you can also play 1v2, 1v3 and 1v4.
    There is a tutorial in this game and unlike some other games, you can actually learn stuff from this one. For basic playing, there is a short tutorial just explaining how to move and jump, but if you have time and will to take your playing technique to the next level, this is taken care of by more advanced tutorials. This is probably one of rare games where you actually want to play tutorial multiple times.
    Car handling is near-perfect, it really goes where you want it to go. Also, you can drive one the walls, fly and even drive upside down on the arena ceiling for a short time.
    A very special thing in this game is so-called ""Ball View"", where camera is always pointing towards the camera. You can turn it on and off at appropriate times to maximize your efficiency while trying to hit the ball into opponents' net.
    Car customization content is absurd. You get hundreds of wheels, antennas, hats, car types ... you are guaranteed to find a combination that suits you.
    Next thing about car customization is how you unlock parts. This is the best way I've seen it handled: you get something for every single match you play. Yes, you've heard right. No matter what you play, with bots with real people, 1v1, you always get something.
    After playing every match, you also get a chance to save a replay of the game you have just played. These saved games can be then watched from perspectives of all players, there is also a free camera mode.
    Matchmaking seems to be working well, I've never been in a match that would be completely unfair or unbalanced.
    The soundtrack is amazing, it consists of 11 songs that are also available on Amazon[www.amazon.com] and iTunes[itunes.apple.com].
    You get XP even for playing with bots, but you get only 50% of you would get with playing online. Still, it's a great way to encourage people to play more. You also get some XP for losing.
    This thing runs great even on old computers and you don't even have to have all the setting set to low!
    The community is really active, there are almost five thousand threads created on Steam Discussions, there are tons of Youtube videos and streamers playing it.
Cons:    Only occasional lags when playing online. Also, sometimes servers are dead for a minute, but that only happened twice to me. Not a problem at all.
    There is PS4 support, but no Linux and MacOS? Come on!
The final verdict:With practically no bad sides and tons of good stuff in this game, I certainly recommend it to everyone, not just fans of soccer or racing. I'm not a big fan of either of them, but I enjoy this game a great deal. You can customize your car in more than 10 billion combinations, the game really encourages you to play and the feeling when you play is amazing. 
This is certainly one of the best games released this year. There are so many people playing all the time, there are streams, Youtube videos, tons of discussions, simply amazing. You can't be sure how long is this going to last for, so try grabbing it as soon as it gets any discount or even now, as it is certainly worth the full 20$ price tag.

												ABOUT THE GAME :

Rocket League is a Soccer inspired sports game made by Psyonix. In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Soccer with cars. 
It might be the best game I've played this year so far.

PRO :
- Great gameplay.
- Very competitive.
- Matchmaking.
- Easy to pick up and a hard way to master.
- Marvelous graphics.
- Tons of customization.
- Cool DLC's.
- Cross-platform.
- Save replays after matches and edit them to your hearts content in the editor.


CON :
- You can unlock a lot of things in such a small time.


Conclusion:
Rocket League is an amazing game!
I highly recommend it ~ 10/10"

												A friend bought me this game because he wanted some partner.. I knew what the game was about but I didn't know it was so much fun.

I'm not a racing car fan, and I'm not a big football (soccer) fan, but this combination is just crazy good.

This is my go to game when I got a short time to kill now and I end up playing one more then one more then one more. DLCs are all cosmetic and in no way needed to enjoy the game so get the base game and Have Fun !!"

												score in your own goal when playing with friends

steal speedboost while driving in circles and do nothing else.

call every enemy goal a ''lucky'' goal,

see a friend go for the ball and make a possible goal, drive in advance and give the ball a slight nudge and steal the goal.

play goalkeeper and cuss at your friends for not making 1 goal for 4 minutes, then go out of your goal to help them and enemy scores

so many ways to troll,

												What I thought was the worst concept EVER (really? Football and Cars together? Come on.. anyone?) ended up being one of the most addictive games I’ve come to cross around.

PROS
-Everyone is on the same page. There is no difference in XP, Cars, Skins or anything. SKILLS are everything
-Very fluid
-No bugs (at least I haven’t found one)
-Multi-Platform
-Coop and Local Coop

CONS
-NO OFFLINE LAN. That kind of sucks… really. This would be a reason to NOT RECOMMEND a good game, but this game is pretty great, so I still give it a recommend (Oh yeah, I wan’t to hear those brats from US and EU talk about how everyone got internet now and we don’t need LAN Anymore, and this is a stupid complain.. please go ahead) 
-Servers give a connection problem all the time. I asked a lot of people, and I am getting the same answer from at least 40% of the people. Maybe is just here in South America, and playing with servers outside the ping goes over 200. The good thing is that the game does not become totally unplayable, especially for new, not all that skilled players (like myself :D)
-No the best Match Making system ever, but this is not a Con per say… just not so great yet I think

But really. Awesome game. Worth the full price. Tell your friends and Rocket!"

												 Very addictive and entertaining game. 

Rocket League is a game that always introduces new aspects to you and never lets you get bored. It is definitely a 'just 5 more minutes' game but amazingly entertaining at the same time. The trading community is excellent and finally getting an item you always wanted can leave you feeling so accomplished. The car customization itself is an awesome feature that offers so many different customizations. As you progress through the different skill levels there are new techniques to learn and playstyles which are awesome to know. The competitive scene behind this game is getting larger and it is so fun to watch such high level players play!

All in all, i'd completely recommend this game to anyone, whether you're a casual player or very competitive!"

												Rocket League, the One More Game simulator.

Rocket League is a really fun game for people of all ages and skill-levels.
The only downside is that you will play at least ten more games if you have decided to only play one before going to bed.
The community is pretty toxic, but luckily it's not that hard to just not pay attention to the chat.
The replay value is really high, especially because there are alot of different gamemodes and maps.
You will always try to improve yourself, and you will notice yourself getting better when times moves on, especially when you learn how to fly. Easy to learn, hard to master!

Highly recommened!

												This game makes soccer (football) extremely fun due to being a car with rockets. You will learn to control your car to hit the ball in various angles. Then you will jump and hit the ball and using your second jump (or dodge depending on direction) to navigate the battlefield or hit the ball harder. Then you will learn the beautiful art of rocket ballet as you use your boost to fly for short periods of time while scoring goals. Mix all those elements with teamwork for a simple, yet extremely complex game filled with sick plays, amazing comebacks, and did he just score a goal flying backwards? What!?

Forget FIFA. Play Rocket League.

I should now mention that their post-launch support has been nothing short of amazing. I don't agree with their decision to include gambling boxes for cosmetics (I prefer to buy things directly), but the amount of free content and excellent modes has been substantial. Rumble has been one of the best modes they've added to the game. The other bonus modes have their own followings too. Some people just play Hockey League exclusively.

Rocket League has incredibly fun gameplay and is backed by a great developer. I just hope they avoid becoming a money hungry monster, but they've been doing a splendid job so far.

They've added a training mode where you can create playlists of different shots for scoring or defending. This is the best addition to the game since Rumble and is incredibly fun to play. I enjoy both making and experiencing what others have created."

People are generally open to teaming up and I've made a lot of friends on this game already. There's a very real sense of progression with both a cumulative rank and a skill rank. It's absurd, it's thrilling, it's hilarious, it's endlessly challenging, and it's addicting. Pay whatever they ask. Just get the game."

Whoever came up with this idea deserves a freakin cookie.  The game is beautiful, the gameplay is perfect, the community is active and generally pretty fun, and the soundtrack is awesome.  You can customize your cars which is always fun.  Also, cross-platform multiplayer!  PC players and PS4 players all play together, which is always a nice feature.

The game has an extremely high skill ceiling and there is tons of nuances to learn to get better at the game; and as someone who intends to play this competitively, there is truely no other title in existance that'll push your skills to the absolute limit in ESL Open tournaments.

												I bought this game when it was really young, it was around a month after release. At the beginning the game was really difficult to play, but after a while you will master it. You should ONLY play this game if you have some kinda controller, cause with Keyboard and Mouse it is almost impossible to play this game. Think about this for yourself and decide if you want to own this game:

- Like to smash cars? BUY IT!
- Like to fly like never before? BUY IT!
- Like racing and football? BUY IT!


I really recommend it. It's the best game I have ever played so far. Why? Almost every month there is a new DLC or update for the game, so it keeps me really exited! 10/10 IGN."

												By now everyone knows what Rocket League is about.
I played it since it was in alpha, loved it from the first match.
With time all my friends bought it, even the ones that didn't like car/racing games or football.
We got countless hours of pure fun out of it. You can play for 10 minutes or 5 hours and still have lots of fun. 
It's easy to pick up and play, but hard to master.
It's cheap, a potato could run it and one of the best coop/competitive games out there.
Go ahead and buy it."

												You first spend 20 hours chasing the ball and learning how to hit it while get used to the ball camera.
Then 200 hours to feel confident soaring in the air, by 500 hours you know how to hit specific angles and use the handbreak to be even faster.
All this depth in a 5 minute game of football with cars.

												The first game I've bought on steam and it was so worth it.
It's a game with a good, steep skill curve to climb as well as a nice, new and upcoming community for Indians (in particular).
Play with your friends over a big screen and enjoy boosting around, demolishing players, flying around, flailing about the ball.
Hand the controller over to someone and watch them amazed as they climb up the walls, score a goal for the first time. 
Super fun and addictive. A must buy.

P.S. I think to climb the skill curve, a controller is necessary."

ConclusionRocket League is an amazing game. You know those games that you play while you should be going to bed? That's this game. Only 90 minutes into the game, and i've already had so much fun with it. I would honestly reccomend this game to anyone. Unless you REALLY hate soccer, and you simultaneously REALLY hate cars.

												I am a hardcore player of DotA2 and CS: Global Offensive. A Clan mate of mine introduced me rocket league just like the other games. He got a 4 Pack and shared it along with us. He used to always pm me about this game and I used to show no interest since it was looking like sonic cars or something like that game. 
After I played my 1st game which was a 3 v 3, Holy ♥♥♥♥ I was astonished about the gameplay.
Every competitve online match is just 5 minutes which is so fun. 

Rating: 10/10 ( I am a Indian, I get 124 ping always which is playable, but looking forward to play on Indian servers which might make it more IMBA) 

Thank you Psyonix for this wonderful game."

												First of all, im reviewing the single player ""seasons"" mode, as i have not played multiplayer.
I was hesitant at first to buy this game, as an arcade style game for 20 dollars seemed like a bit too much, but i have to say, this game turned out to be much better than i thought.
It runs smoothly with little to no lag, and the controls are smooth (Using a wired Xbox 360 Controller) and that is something that a game as chaotic as this one certainly needs.
The customization options for your vehicle are very fun to play around with, and you can end up with some pretty crazy looking cars! And you unlock the items just by playing matches, which makes it very easy to get new items.
The camera options are very convenient, Allowing you to change the FOV, Height, Angle, and distance of the camera.
Now, for the actual game, the seasons mode is very fun and competitive, allowing you to pick from different teamates, and to choose how many cars are on the teams. 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 are the option. 4v4 is my favourite so far though, as it's rather chaotic.
Possibly the best thing about seasons mode is that even by yourself you still get very competitive, and that's something that i dont think many games deliver on.
The music is a bit garbled and im not sure whether or not its supposed to play all the time, as it usualy stops within a few secconds.
Overall, for a game that was just released, it is very fun and i'd recommend it to everyone, whether they like sports or not. I think this game would be even more entertaining with friends, but i don't have any friends that own this game."

												Rocket League is one of my favorite games.  Why?


The game's system is the best that i can imagine. Your advantage over other players isn't measured by how many hours you have, how many dlcs you got, or your level. It's measured by how much you've learned and perfected.

You start as a derp car that can't hit a ball 20ft above the ground. Then you keep playing against people of the same skill, until you see someone who can do some cool/pro/funky/op stuff, then you see his goals and you think: ""Wow, look at that shot, i must learn how to do it!""        
      Then in a matter of time, you learn how to do it and even do better. One step closer to become a Rocketeer.                  
                                                       some more training and you can hit the ball wherever it is.
                                                    even more and you can aim the ball wherever you want.

The controls are great, comfortable and very easy to learn. If you use a controller, you will not have an advantage against who uses a keyboard and vice-versa.

The graphics are nice, you can play it with a microwave using low graphics, or a medium computer on max graphics with a solid 60 fps. They could be better though (?)

The levels normally represent your skill very well if you aren't a lot above-average or below-average, with a Rookie playing like a rookie and a legend playing like a legend. (The level ""Pro"" is just wrong, you probably aren't pro yet if you are there)

The matchmaker does its job well. Rather than your level, it takes your ""skill"" in consideration, so you will often play with people only slightly better or worse than you. This isn't bad, it is actually very good for you to learn and get better.

Can i say anything more?
NO item in the game gives you advantage over other player, all cars have the same speed and the only thing that changes is the hitbox, not a big deal when you learn the controls. The DLCs don't make you better or anything, too."

												Oh god, where do I start with this game?

Rocket League.... a football game, with cars!

A straightforward design that doesn't need much explanation.

There are a metric butt ton of modes, the game has great music, and cool car customisation (including my home flag, Australia, wohoo!)

The ranking system is equitable and keeps you playing to progress to the next level. 

Game is insanely fun, there is a wide range of customisations that does not have an effect on the car (no advantages wohoo! +1 on that)

- Server occasionally disconnects me.

This game is great to play on when you're ?#@*&%! at another game, great game to chill out on.

Awesome game, must buy"

												Rocket League is one of those games that pop up every once in awhile and make a statement and a change. The simplicity of the game which the eye first meets, to the fine complexity of the game that is not first seen but learned through experience is what makes the game so great. When you first start out you may not realize you can even double jump or fly, yet the game is still so fun. Then you spend some time playing your judgement gets better and you learn to make moves effectively in order to be competitive. You then notice there is training and so on and so forth you start changing camera settings and button layouts so you can be as effective as possible. This game has so many layers to it. Iv noticed there's a really steep learning curve to this game and then you plateau for awhile. Then you kind of step your way up and up as you then notice you have a few hundred hours into the game and your still not bored. Iv never seen a game that can keep me so addicted to and yet it's such a simple idea. What makes it great to me is how there is no aid in shooting or blocking it's your rocket car against physics and gravity with your car as the force to change its directing. It is so satisfying to score a game winning goal or the game winning save for your team. Once you start playing with friends and communicating you realize how serious it gets. I can't think of anything that's bad about this game the work they are doing is great and now Xbox one is coming into the cross play making it one of if not the first games to allow PC, PS4, and XBOX ONE to play together. If you have not bought this game and I was one who looked over it a few times but still had it on the back of my mind it was one of those, oh if I have an extra $20 I'll buy it. NOOO if you have the money I don't care what your plan was with that $50 steam card this game is a must have and I'm sure every single rocket league player can say the same thing there's much more than to what meets the eye."

												Rocket League is an immensely fun game. It is easy to get into and will draw you in from the get-go.
RL is great for casual play if you want to just have some quick fun, and has a very high skill ceiling for those that like to invest the time and effort into their competitive games.
I usually judge games based off a price to play time ratio, and this game is well worth the $20 if you ask me."

												This game should be the next E-Sport!

Who would have thought combining Football(soccer) with cars would be such fun? You can play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and even 4v4. The game has matchmaking, A.I. players, and even ranked matches so you can see how you match up with everyone else.

A unique feature is you can cross-play this with PS4 users who have the game. Future updates will expand upon this to allow you to create parties with your PC/PS4 friends.

Everyone out there seems to be playing this game, and with good reason.

You owe it to yourself to get this one and play with your friends, or make new ones!"

												Quick, competitive gameplay with easy to understand mechanics makes rocket league a fun game with high replayability. It is clear to an active player that the developers truly care about the game and constantly release features everyone can enjoy. Even if you pick this game up just to play locally with some friends, it will be worth every penny. Every new patch has new features that are exciting and keep me coming back time and time again. In matches, it's rare to feel cheated out of a game due to RNG. Even if you don't want to play, the simple premise makes watching rocket league quite enjoyable at any skill level. I highly suggest playing this game as much as you possibly can."

												I don't usually buy games at full price (especially not at $20), but decided to give this a try.  Long story short, it has been worth every penny, and is one of the most addictive games I have played in years.  

Pros - Perfect for study breaks since each match is only about 5 minutes.  Read one chapter of your textbook... reward yourself with a match.
 - Simple and easy to play, but challenging to master.  Figuring out how to hit the ball (especially in the air) is difficult at first, and there is a learning curve.
 - Great developers who have already announced free DLCs (along with extra paid cosmetic DLCs).
 - Optimized even for low-spec PCs.
 - Cross-platform with PS4.

Cons - There used to be a problem with people quitting midway through a ranked game with no penalty.  However, now there is a 15 minute ban from matchmaking for leaving ranked games, so it is not as much an issue now.
 - Difficult to play without a controller, but still possible.  I would recommend a controller if you buy this.
 - Occasional lag on servers (but hopefully will be resolved in the future).

Overall, I would highly recommend this game.  10/10"

												TL;DR 

---------

Its addictive and my most played game to date. Please buy it in or out of a sale :)

So, I was going to write a review at 100 hours but another 100 later and its... Been a few days... What can I say, the game is worth it at full price PLUS DLC (I have most DLC -- 3 are needed to 100% achievements). This game is very easy to pick up and there are tons of skills to master the game -- from dribbling to advanced aerials -- if you want to play it competitively or just improve. Plus there are tons more to come with Rocket Labs introduced and there is a basketball mode in the making as I write this review :)

---------

Pros -- 
 Great customization with base game and/or with DLC. You can customize paint, wheels, car body, the boost, hats etc!
 Great common and uncommon drops
 Gameplay is steady, you can easily play with keyboard and mouse or controller (I personally use an Xbox One controller)
 Love the soundtrack 
 Achievements are easy but maybe a little bit of a grind for some 
 The UI is clean and well set out -- there is even a nice quick chat feature (Nice shot, Centering, Defending etc)
 You can save replays to watch later or upload to youtube
 It's so much fun to play alone in 1v1, matchmaking in 2v2/3v3/4v4 or with friends
 Community is mostly friendly, you can now report... the rest...
  The devs are great, they are constantly changing the game with a new ranked system and maps etc!
  Great training modes and multiple levels of difficulty of AI to practice offline or before/in between a match
Well... You get the point with the pros...

Cons
  Achievements and little content in the DLC does not feel worth it but forces you to buy if you want to 100% the game... DLC isn't needed so not a big deal. But hey... Batmobile DLC... GET IT! 
 I have had maybe 2 crashes and a few bad connections in my time, but it reconnects you to the match you were in so you don't lose XP 
Conclusion... Buy the game. Its awesome. I've had a blast and there will be many more hours of fun to come! The game will only get better from here! Whoops... Nice shot! 10/10 <3"

the vehicles themselves are very acrobatic, You can boost, turn and flip mid-air
and perform moves like bicycle kicks. every match you play you unlocks a random
accessory you can customize your car with. 
It's very easy to learn and play but there are also pro-maneuvers to be mastered.

												Detailed Review by Ashes

SummaryRocket League is a multiplayer soccer game with rocket cars instead of human players developed by Psyonix and a sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. It includes a range of different cars, arenas, cosmetics and gets constant updates which add new content, tweaks and bug fixes.

Cars and all the different unlockables are purely cosmetic and make absolutely no difference in gameplay, all of the new arenas are free which means the community does not get divided when new ones come out. The currently released paid dlc packs are simply cosmetic items and do not change gameplay or give any advantages to the buyers beside bragging rights.

One thing that I like a fair lot is that there are no gimmicks and no unlockable advantages.  Everything you have in Rocket League, you have from the beginning itself and the only important factor is your skill. This is how competitive games should be made. Nothing makes a player who has more hours superior to you except his skill, it's plain and simple.

GameplayRocket League is fairly easy to learn, but oh god is it hard to master. You can drive around, use your boost, jump, propel your car into the air with the boost, launch your car forward or in any other major direction and one often overlooked feature is the ability to spin your car around in mid air.

There are several match types: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4. Each of them excluding the 4v4 have ranked versions if you feel extra competitive. When a match starts you spawn at one of several possible locations on the arena and the ball spawns at the center. Both teams rush to the ball for the first hit. Like in traditional football there is one goal on each side of the field and the objective is to score into the enemy team's goal while protecting your own. Scattered through the arena are boost fill-ups which can be picked up from both sides of the field regardless of your team.

In terms of competitiveness Rocket League nails it, the complete lack of perks and upgrades make the outcome of matches rely purely on your skill and a hint of luck every now and then. Gameplay is exceptionally fun and enjoyable, you'll probably spend your first few matches hopelessly driving around the field not even touching the ball, but after a while you'll eventually get the hang of it and learn when to go for the ball, when to strike and how to position yourself among a lot of other things. As silly as the concept of rocket car football might sound, Rocket League is a very competitive game which even managed to secure its position as an electronic sport.

The way a match progresses is fairly simple and much like real life football. After every goal the players and ball reset and both teams rush towards the ball for the first hit much like in the beginning of the game. If you end up tying a match overtime takes place and the first team to score wins. Overtime doesn't have any sort of time limit so a match can go on until your fingers fall off and your eyes melt.

Matches are a team based effort and while it may be easy to win one of them in lower ranks without being a team player you will find that without proper communication and strategy you cannot win in the higher ranks. This brings me to another point, one particularly frustrating thing is that players can abandon matches without any form of punishment and to make matters even worse when a player leaves a ranked match no new player can connect in his/her place, which makes you are stuck with a bot. A system that punishes people for leaving games would be very welcome.

Arenas, Cars and Car CustomizationThere are 5 different arenas and each of them has its own theme and some have different variations, but note that they do not affect gameplay whatsoever, but instead offer a nice and welcome change of scenery. All of them have a lot of detail and provide you with loads of eye candy.

Different cars offer completely cosmetic changes and so do car customization options. There is a total of 14 cars including the dlc ones so far and more than a few hats, wheel types, boost effects etc., the only thing lacking variety are the decals. Unfortunately there are only 5 decals per car and the game doesn't let you move them around your car or re-size them in any way, but you can change their color.

Graphics and SoundRocket League is absolutely gorgeous offering a lot of detail in both graphical and sound quality. The game is so detailed that you can literally see each individual piece of grass on the field. The soundtrack is perfect for a sports game like this and the sound effects are absolutely nailed. There are a lot of small details everywhere and if you have a powerful enough PC to max this game out you will surely be astonished by its graphical beauty.

A very small, but nice little detail I've noticed is that each type of boost effect has its own different sound effect. Every time a goal is scored the ball explodes in a mixture of paint and fireworks and lets out a very satisfying explosion sound. As much as I try I can't find anything to complain about regarding the graphics and sound of this game.

Technical DetailsRocket League is very well optimized, has no fps lock and a constant reliable framerate, a full PC interface and it supports gamepads, it has more than enough graphical, sound and game options. You can fully rebind your keys with both keyboards and controllers. I have to warn people with weaker or/and older systems that it might be difficult for them to run the game even at lower settings because it's pretty demanding. 

Everything you'd expect to be included in a game like this already is. We have cross-platform play with PlayStation users as well as split screen co-op on PC. After playing this for a fair bit of time, I even think that the PC version was simultaneously developed with the PS4 one instead of being ported, correct me if I'm wrong.

All bugs and problems usually get fixed withing a span of several days and the game is constantly supported by the devs. One of my only problems with Rocket League is its servers. Sometimes, despite having really low ping I get disconnected or start lagging all over the place. This can be especially frustrating in ranked matches where losing can lower the rank you've worked so hard to reach.

ConclusionI've enjoyed all of my time playing this. It was incredibly fun to play with random people online, but even more fun with my friends. Gameplay is spot on, PC version is amazing and probably better than the console one, every feature I would want is implemented and the whole thing is just beautiful.

This sort of purely skill-based gameplay is what more competitive games should be. No perks, no nuttin'. Just you and your team against the opposing team. Matches are short and intense and there is no big learning curve which means the game is really easy to get into for newcomers.

I recommend this to anyone. If you are just looking for something casual and fun you'll definitely like it and if you are looking for something competitive and hard to master you're just bound to love it.

PROS
Skill-based gameplay
Exceptionally fun
Easy to learn, hard to master

A decent selection of cars
A lot of customization options excluding decals
Mindblowingly beautiful graphics and great soundtrack

												This game is so simple yet so fun. I cannot explain it, but it's highly addictive. I mean, driving small cars and playing soccer with the oversized ball? Sounds stupid. But actually it's dynamic, tense and fun, especially in online play. 

You can unlock cars, decals, tires, painjobs, stuff like that, you can also play training, exibition, seasons and of course multiplayer. I have it on both PC and PS4 and I have to say, it's much easier to play with controller than keyboard. 

Anyway, yes, I would recommend this because it's pure fun!

												An incredible game created by incredible developers that care for quality and their fans. Psyonix have put so much effort into creating this car football sequel and have delivered exactly what fans from the community have asked for. (And more!)

The visuals are colourful, over the top and impressive.
Physics and gameplay are perfect and the game plays just how it should.
Loads of customisation items. Literally millions of different combinations.
The online is very very stable.
Various ways to play with friends including up to 4 player split screen.
Cross play for PC and PS4.
A season mode for offline play.
Replay editor which also acts as a photo mode is a very welcome feature.
Future support for the game confirmed, including DLC and free stadiums.
Day one release on PlayStation Plus for free is a wonderful bonus and a very loyal move from Psyonix to their fans.

This game is tons of fun and is the most fun I've had with a game in ages. You won't regret picking this up. Although you may never put it down."

												Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...

Rookie - You can't hit ♥♥♥♥. You are a disgrace to your team and the game.

Semi Pro - You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still ♥♥♥♥.

Pro - You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller, ♥♥♥♥-head.

Veteran - You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!

Expert - You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.

Master - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam ""Sorry!"" every time they do something wrong to you.

Legend - The most badass-looking title you can have. ♥♥♥♥ Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""

Rocketeer - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag, but if you didn't: Still prepare for another endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Rocketeer!""

But in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole-nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)

If you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review, just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA). 
Think about it this way: You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game. Ignore the childish-looking pictures on the store page. Just get this game. This is the one.

EDIT - 2/13/2016:
You know a game is amazing when the servers go down and you'd rather train offline than play any of your other 500+ games...

												Soccer with rocket cars?  Yes, please!  

This game is finely crafted multiplayer perfection (and the single player modes are great too), with the right touch of chaos to go along with skillful gameplay.  Even when you mess up a great shot or send the ball flying into your own goal, you'll have a lot of fun doing it.  I expect the skill ceiling for this game to be very, very high over time, but it's forgiving enough that even people who feel overwhelmed by other online games can have a lot of fun and contribute to the team. 

An absolute steal for the price - if you buy it, you'll keep playing, and playing, and playing....

(In fact, what am I doing here?  I need to get back in there - FOR GLORY!)"

												1,500 hours in and the game is even more enjoyable than it was when I began. While it takes time to master specific skills the outcome is worth it, and makes the game continuously fun. The community is so much better than other games, not as toxic, more friendly, more fun, The developers listen to the community and constantly try to improve the game to make it more exciting. It's not pay to win, so anyone can do just as well without spending any extra money. 

It is also optional to play with either keyboard + mouse (like myself for 1,450 hours) or use a controller. While a controller allows for more specific angles, the game is still as fun without it. You can still get a professional level on keyboard + mouse, it is just preference, however for people starting out I would suggest using a controller if it's available as it CAN allow for some better shots.


Overall a  fantastic game, definitely one I'm not giving up on anytime soon."

I bought it with the idea of playing it for 30 minutes or so before heading out for the weekend.

Almost 3 hours later I'm still playing it, and I want to play it more.

It is just plain FUN, something I feel that has been missing from the majority of games that I have played recently.

If the idea of rocket flying cars playing destruction derby football in massive stadiums appeals to you then...

												I can't even begin to give this game enough praise. Why?

I start playing this game with the intent to only play an hour, and realize many hours later how long I've actually been playing. Whether I'm experiencing a bitter defeat, a glorious victory, or a five minute overtime bout I'm still having a blast. I yell, I shout, I pump my fist in hoorah for that aerial save I just made. And I still can't get enough of this game.

Rocket League is a very well polished sportsy footballesque game where you drive cars and try to shoot the ball into the opposing teams goal. It's a simple concept but with all the moves and tricks your cars can perform there is suprising depth in how to play as an indvidual and as a team. You can perform all types of moves, you can do just about any type of roll or flip perceivable, single jumps, double jumps, and you can even fly with your boost. This is one of the few games that I've had this level of drive to master my play, and with two whole days of game time logged away I feel like I've really just mastered the basics and am just now scratching the surface on higher level play.

I'm often a bit hestitant to jump into online games, especially ranked. I find ranked matches in general to be stressful and a little too adrenaline intensive, yet in Rocket League I've had nothing but a blast playing competitively even when I was as green as the turf I was driving on. I've never even hesitated to try new things in competitive games or to try and master aerial shots and other such techniques that are easy to screw up. In short, I've had a lot of fun playing this game and the drive to better my play has been a contributing factor to my enjoyment. Playing with a friend makes the game all the more enjoyable, being able to shout at each other over VOIP about each amazing shot we convert or each epic save we make makes an already exciting game all the more awesome.

Bottom line. This game is FUN. It's just fun. You jump in, you find a match, you play, and you have fun. It's not overly complex, it doesn't add lots of un-needed features. It's straight up action packed fun.

P.S. And of course, like any good driving game, you can customize your ride so you can kick butt in style."

It is a game with a simple concept, it is loads of fun as so many things can happen in a match that makes it exciting every time, such as an epic save or goal. Playing with friends is definitely recommended as i find its the way to play that i found brings the most fun, but if you solo queue it is still exciting. The controls in the game are simple to use and playing with a keyboard is very doable. This game is definitely worth the price and will bring many hours of fun!"

			My review of ""Rocket League"", the 2015 multiplayer racing soccer game developed and published by Psyonix. ------------------------------- Like on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming...		
	

Game: Rocket League
Genre: Multiplayer Racing Soccer Game
Developer: Psyonix
Publisher: Psyonix
Copy supplied by Steam

Rocket League is a multiplayer racing soccer game developed and published by Psyonix. I am telling you already: go out and buy this game, it is one of the best games of this generation.

GRAPHICSMade with the Unreal engine, it looks very damn great: particle effects, lighting, shadows, textures... Everything is well done. The only real nitpick I have are the arena: excluding the ones in Rocket Labs, there is nothing that makes each level unique other than a few changes in the background. But the physics are fantastic.

GAMEPLAYThe game is very simple: it is soccer, but with cars equipped with rockets instead of players. You can boost, you can jump, and you can double jump. That is it. Is it simple? Yeah. But is it done perfectly? Hell yeah!
There are many game modes to choose from: 1v1 duel, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, Rocket Labs (experimental maps), Snow (that no one is playing), and the new Hoops (basketball). There is great variety, and each mode is fun to play. Each time you finish a game, you will get a reward, ranging from hats to flags to customize your car and make it your own.

CHALLENGEThe bots can be pretty dumb, usually doing autogoals for no reason at all, and other times they are incredibly hard to beat. The game is very easy to understand and even to master, so almost every player will be a threat.

SOUNDThe soundtrack to the game is fine, and the sound effects are okay.

REPLAYABILITYThere is plenty of money for your buck: each round usually lasts around 5 minutes, and you will quickly notice that you have spent three consecutive hours saying ""One more, and then I'll sleep"". The achievements also require some skills and not easy to achieve tactics, like scoring a goal while reversing.

Overall, Rocket League is a top notch game that is a must buy for every gamer out there who has a decent Internet connection: fun, addicting, challenging. What more do you want?

												I'm going to keep this review short and sweet.

It's amazing, for the price, the specifications, it's all great. It's very easy to run on the highest settings, it doesn't require experience for you to pick up the basics and jump into the competetive side of this title, it's fun and enjoyable and very replayable.

You are given a customization item after every match (If you don't disconnect) which is awesome as it makes you want to play more!

You can play: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and my favourite, 4v4.

Seriously, buy this game, you don't need to like Football (Soccer) to enjoy this game. It's just fun.

9/10.

Con: The servers are slightly laggy at times, but i'm sure this will be looked upon."

												So I feel like I've played enough of this game now to write a review...


The good.The gameplay: While simple, is very fun. It's soccer, with cars, but the cars have boosters, and can fly :). It's great and engaging, it challenges you to learn new techniques to stay ahead of your opponents. The feeling when you hit that first aerial goal is amazing..trust me ;).
Graphics and performance: The graphics aren't anything to write home about, but this is a good thing in this case. This game runs beautifully on most systems, low or high end alike. I have seen a system with 2gb of ram and a dual core cpu with a gtx 440 gpu run this game on medium settings at 40fps. On my medium spec system it runs at 80-100fps on max settings.
Longevity: As mentioned before, this game challenges you to learn new things and experiment to grow in skill. I always feel like I am getting better, and not just stagnating in skill.
DLC: Best cars in the game are free! DLC just for cosmetic purposes!
There are of course, other good elements to this game, those however are the main points in my opinion. I'd rather alert you to the potential difficulties in the remainder of this review.The bad.Matchmaking: The matchmaking does a decent job of pairing you with good opponents. BUT! If two players of unequal skill levels are playing together in a party, it will find a match to the skill level of the better player. This makes it unpleasent for the lower tier player. Ping is NOT at all accounted into the matchmaking. I live in an area far from the server locations, I am used to getting 200+ ping. Anything under 250 ping is playable. Sometimes however I can enter a ranked match with ping in excess of 600, this is not playable, and is basically a garunteed derank. This won't be a problem for most people, but for those of us living in the dark parts of the world, beware! Not the smoothest experience.
Community: While not nearly as bad as the CSGO community, it has it's fair share of trollers and salty kids. This should be a given with a large multiplayer game, but it's liable to get worse as the game grows, so take note!Verdict
Is Rocket League a good game? ... Yes.
Is it fun? ... Yes, especially with friends.
Is it worth the price? ... Yes, definitely, but if you struggle financially, wait for a sale, as is the case with all games.
Should YOU buy it? ... If you like the idea and want to try it out, yes. If you don't like racing or soccer, you may still love it (as is the case with myself), if you want a serious racing or soccer game though, look elsewhere.

HIGHLY RECCOMENDED"

												This game is fun at all skill levels.  It's intuitive to learn the rules and difficult to master the mechanics and strategy.  Rocket League is one of the most unique, innovative games around.  I originally bought it when it came out thinking $20 for a weekend of fun would be worth it, but a couple thousand hours later it's still challenging and enjoyable.  My #1 game since it came out.  Much love to Psyonix <3"

												In the 80s and 90s, this is what everyone thought video games would be like in the future: rocket cars playing virtual sports; TRONxSpeed Racer, with the international appeal of soccer. 
You're jacked in to this new thing called the Internet, where you can play against people the world 'round. You're a weakly 13 year old midwesterner named Billy, but when you're jacked in, you're Tom Cruise in Top Gun, no, Days of Thunder. You're the best there ever was.

Stay on target, stay on target... click, blarp. You're out of rocket fuel! You click again just in case, like a last desperate pull of an empty gun's trigger. The clock ticks downward as you swerve towards a boost pickup... you grab it... seconds left on the clock... the ball appears in front of you as an angel out of the blue... you jump, squeeze the last bit of juice out of your machine and soar heavenward... AND IT'S GOOD! BILLY FROM THE MIDWEST HAS DEFEATED THE RUSSIAN MENACE!!!!

Every second you play the game is the last five minutes of every sports movie ever made."

												I'm not really a huge fan of driving games. I'm not really a huge fan of sports games.

But this........ this rules.

Rocket League is one of the most addictively fun games I have ever played. The graphical presentation and flow of the animations is sharp, fluid and perfect, just like the control and response (regardless of whether you prefer keyboard/mouse or controller).

The soundtrack selection is wonderful.

The insane amount of unlockable content, combined with some really reasonably priced DLC adds to its replayability and sense of progression. Playing a new vehicle is like installing a brand new game.

This game really puts you in a competitive state of mind. It's a type of intense that keeps you wanting to come back. Scoring asinine goals and making big saves and assists in Rocket League is one of the most satisfying experiences I've ever had the pleasure of having in a video game.

Don't pass it up. It'll be your loss."

			My review of ""Rocket League"", the 2015 multiplayer racing soccer game developed and published by Psyonix. ------------------------------- Like on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming...		
	

Game: Rocket League
Genre: Multiplayer Racing Soccer Game
Developer: Psyonix
Publisher: Psyonix
Copy supplied by Steam

Rocket League is a multiplayer racing soccer game developed and published by Psyonix. I am telling you already: go out and buy this game, it is one of the best games of this generation.

GRAPHICSMade with the Unreal engine, it looks very damn great: particle effects, lighting, shadows, textures... Everything is well done. The only real nitpick I have are the arena: excluding the ones in Rocket Labs, there is nothing that makes each level unique other than a few changes in the background. But the physics are fantastic.

GAMEPLAYThe game is very simple: it is soccer, but with cars equipped with rockets instead of players. You can boost, you can jump, and you can double jump. That is it. Is it simple? Yeah. But is it done perfectly? Hell yeah!
There are many game modes to choose from: 1v1 duel, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, Rocket Labs (experimental maps), Snow (that no one is playing), and the new Hoops (basketball). There is great variety, and each mode is fun to play. Each time you finish a game, you will get a reward, ranging from hats to flags to customize your car and make it your own.

CHALLENGEThe bots can be pretty dumb, usually doing autogoals for no reason at all, and other times they are incredibly hard to beat. The game is very easy to understand and even to master, so almost every player will be a threat.

SOUNDThe soundtrack to the game is fine, and the sound effects are okay.

REPLAYABILITYThere is plenty of money for your buck: each round usually lasts around 5 minutes, and you will quickly notice that you have spent three consecutive hours saying ""One more, and then I'll sleep"". The achievements also require some skills and not easy to achieve tactics, like scoring a goal while reversing.

Overall, Rocket League is a top notch game that is a must buy for every gamer out there who has a decent Internet connection: fun, addicting, challenging. What more do you want?

												Cars and Football 10/10.

Pros-
Strongly Addictive
All cars perform the exact same meaning there are no OP options
Great customisable unlocks
Matchmaking is fair
Great optimisation
Very intense and action packed
Something you can play for hours on end
No glitches
Great physics and mechanics
Bots perform very much alike other players
Oh, and did I mention it was strongly addictive...

Cons-
Servers go down quite often

Possible improvements that I believe would keep this games popularity and addictiveness-
Free DLC introducing new stadiums, cars and more customisable options to unlock
Competitive matchmaking system (Similar to Counter Strike Global Offense)
24/7 working matchmaking servers!

Anyone debating whether to get this or not should BUY IT NOW!"

												This is the first game I've ever felt inclined to give a review on. I have to say it's probably one of my favorite multiplayer experiences ever. NO LAG on online multiplayer, great graphics but still very well optimized, and a fun community that simply loves the game. I'm not one to choose these kinds of indie competitive games but the gameplay at least had me wanting to use it as a local multiplayer game (yes, it can have up to 4-way splitscreen). However, after playing one match online I ended up playing for a few hours straight. 

I highly reccomend this game. Since it is new, the player base is fairly large (about 40,000 in matchmaking from 11pm to 2am) it will surely give you hours upon hours back on your money. 

10/10 Will binge play this until my fingers bleed.

P.S. I was playing this with a controller so I'm not sure how well the keyboard controls work for this."

												By now everyone knows what Rocket League is about.
I played it since it was in alpha, loved it from the first match.
With time all my friends bought it, even the ones that didn't like car/racing games or football.
We got countless hours of pure fun out of it. You can play for 10 minutes or 5 hours and still have lots of fun. 
It's easy to pick up and play, but hard to master.
It's cheap, a potato could run it and one of the best coop/competitive games out there.
Go ahead and buy it."

												You have to play this to understand the appeal - watching the trailer does not do it justice.

This is a no-brainer, so I will keep it short. Rocket League is so over-the-top utterly addicting and blood-pumping insane, that its really hard to come up with anything negative about it. Its soccer/football with jacked-up racecars. 

Pros:
+Graphics are crisp and just overall amazing
+Controls are intuitive
+Amazing amount of content
+Overall the whole thing is super well done
+Playing online is so simple, and the score system and leaderboards are perfectly created
+They even threw in four player local splitscreen 
+There are nearly 150,000 players on at any given time
+Complete car customization, and you earn new parts and stuff all the time

Cons:
-Twenty bones sounds expensive until you try it ;)

My god buy this already."

												If i could describe this game in a resumed way, I'd say that this is the type of games that you wonder why it hadn't been made earlier and at the same time you praise the fact that its developed in the best way it could have been developed; It revolutionates the sense of gaming.

There isn't enough to be said about this game: Its it's simplicity that really pulls the trigger on this game's gameplay. As of a competitive game, it is obvious that you will have hundreds, if not thousands of hours invested in this game. It is easy to learn, however hard to master. If you are scared of the cars having advantages and disavantages, dont be worried: they are purely aesthetic and has no influence on gameplay. And it also combines the fact that its a great game, both for bringing your friends together for marathons of laughs and for marathons of competitiveness.]

If i can describe it competitively i would say its like you are having shots of competitiveness and fun; it's games are only 5 minutes long (longer if eventually the team ties up and the game has to end with any of the teams scoring the tiebreaker) and are incredible tense and fast paced. You will find yourself amazed by some of the plays made here and the sense of physics is well ported onto here.

There are its flaws, however: The game does bring a certain ammount of questions whether it has enough items to be unlocked or not, as you will find yourself unlocking all of the game's content in a matter of hours, there are some server issues from time to time (minimal most of the time though) and there is the issue of not being able to have car customizable slots, where you'll find yourself having to customize your car to scratch if you ever change its model; all things that can be fixed throughout the updates and the dev that I gained my trust on from the time i played this game.

In general, its a great add-up to your library that will fill hours of your life, that, in my opinion, were not wasted on.

9.5/10"

												Rocket League is a physics-based vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in July 2015, with a version for Xbox One and beta versions for OS X and Linux being released in 2016.

This game is really fun, it gives hours of fun with or without your friends, it varies in game modes such as football (soccer) basketball and ice hockey, my personal favourite has got to be soccer, you can spend hours perfecting your touch of the game, by improving ariel strikes, ground striking, goalkeeping, it's endless. It is filled with a great community which can make you a lot of new friends! Once you've gotten better and played a lot at perfecting your touch, you can play more competetive by playing ranked, it's like normal but obviously harder and more competetive. I would definetly recommend this, it has hours of fun, which seems to never end being fun. I would give this a 9/10, it's very fun and I hope to play more."

												Intro:
Rocket League is a sequel to the less-known vehicular football video game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released in July 2015 for PC and PS4 and got a Xbox One version earlier this year. There are an OS X and Linux versions planned to be released this year. A lot of people (myself included) had never heard of SARPBC until they tried Rocket League out.


Base Concept:
The base concept for this game as simple as it gets: combine football with cars and try to defeat the opponent team. The idea sounds pretty simple and many would think that it will be easier to play than actual football games such as FIFA or PES. If you are one of those people, then you're suddenly mistaken.

The game is easy to understand but often you'll end up having to put effort into it in order to succeed. It is challenging and usually you will have to fly in air in order to get or shoot the ball. You are awarded XP points which are assigned to you after the end of every match. Those XP points are the ones that make you actually ""level up"" in the game. There are 2 different types of ranks: normal and competitive ones. Normal ones are gathered by levelling up while the competitive ranks are gathered by playing the competitive game modes.


Gameplay:
The game consists of a couple game modes: standard football ones, basketball (named Hoops) and the chaotic Rumble mode that features around 10 special items you can use to give yourself the advantage while your team has the possession of the ball. Due to the arenas being not as big as they are in real life, having 22 players chasing 1 ball would be, to say the least, too chaotic. For that sake, Psyonix decided to restrict teams to a maximum of four players per team.

Matches consisting of 1 to 3 cars are optimal ones while the ones featuring 4 cars per team are, although no less entertaining, reasonably marked as ""Chaos"". Then there are the Hoops and Rumble game modes, first of which is basically basketball combined with cars while the second one represents the already known combination of football and cars, this time with some special effects and items which can help you to score some goals.

The game surely is entertaining and even if you were never a fan of either football or racing, this game may take your interest. The game has some collision model problems (not really bugs, but just unoptimized car collisions) which can be noticed in goal replays. Sometimes, you can clearly see the ball flying away even though visually, you didn't actually hit it. That is not a very big problem, though, and it happens only when your car's front is supposed to hit the ball.

On the keyboard, the controls feel great and are just like you'd expect them to be. The game features boost pickups which you can use to temporarily speed up your car or for flying like a rocket (obviously representing the name of the game itself). Sadly, the matchmaking is not very optimized and from time to time, a ""semi-pro"" or a ""pro"" ranked player will have to play against an ""expert"" or even a ""master"". That is, of course, not fair.

Would be a bad thing to forget the car customization. While Rocket League doesn't support modding, you can customize your cars with tons of different body colors, wheels, trails, antennas and items to put on the top of your car (literally hats for cars).

Visuals:
Rocket League is running on the Unreal Engine 3. Its visuals are colorful and look simply beautiful. The arenas are filled with different colors (mostly the team colors) and some of them even have country flags hanging around them. All the arenas (excluding the rocket labs) have similar layouts and a pretty unique theme.

The 3D main menu is set in one of the arenas and you can rotate the camera to see different angles of your car which is very helpful especially when it comes to car customization. There are tons of different options that can improve the effects in-game or the actual game experience.


Verdict:
This game is a really awesome example of how an interesting combination of 2 totally different things with great execution can be strong and not require tons of features in order to get players return to it on a daily basis. With over 50K players on a daily basis, this game promises to bring you a lot of fun, excitement and even anger. It's one of those games that are really easy to learn and understand, but very difficult to master. If you do have some time and are looking for a way to burn hours in which you are bored, this is the right thing to go for.

The matchmaking needs optimization and there are some features (such as demolishing other players) that are very often (ab)used by other players for the sake of preventing you of defending or scoring, or how many people like to call it - dirty playing.

+ Option to destroy opponets

Soundtrack+ Amazing electronic music that fits great in the game
- Music is hard to hear, and doesn't seem to play at all while playing. Only in menus :-(

Modding- Despite huge modding potential, all files are locked out, so no love for modding

Achievements+ Many interesting acheivements
- You cannot get 100% unless you are ready to pay for every DLC they make. And there's gonna be many.

All in all, I do recommened the game despite lack of support for mods."

												This game makes me rage more than any game I've ever played (probably because I'm absolute ♥♥♥♥ at it). This game and CSGO are the only video games where I've seen myself improve dramatically, and that is wonderful. I feel on top of the world when I win and like total garbage when I lose. I have actually spent 2 hours in practice mode trying to perfect my skills because I care so much about winning in this game.

												What to say about Rocket League except the fact that some servers got a really bad ping... In general, it's a very very great game.

The goods : 

- Many differents items and cars
- The gameplay is awesome
- The maps are awesome
- Awesome textures aswell
- 19,99$ isn't that much for a game like this
- I saw an incoming DLC for FREE +rep
- The crowd is like the same when you watch Soccer

The bads :

- The ping on some servers are ♥♥♥♥ sometimes (happen in several games)
- Some people think they're good on ranked but they just need MORE practice and some players can be toxic too (it happens in every community)

My rating for this game is a 8/10"

												With only 200+ hours put into this game so far, it never gets boring, played on your own or with a group of friends each match feels different. Not to mention It feels just as fun as the first match you played when you first purchased the game. I always find myself saying ""Just one more match"" when really I find myself another 30 minutes into it. Its just one of those games that your hooked to the moment you press launch. 

In Rocket League, customisation is a big part of this game with such a large variety of items. You will tend to find yourself saying before a match ""No wait! Dont play yet, I want to fix my car up quickly before we start!"" Especially now with the release of the Champion Crate series its made it just that much more interesting with the amount of newer items available. 
 
Overall I just think this game is fantastic and I feel it can only get better and better with time. 

I've nominated this game for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" Award where I think alot of us who play this game, will agree it deserves this award."

												If you're even just slightly interested in arcade racing games and/or football, then you should check this out...well, actually, even if you're not ;)

In Rocket League, you're playing football (or soccer) with cars, with the addition that you have a speed booster and you can jump, which can make for some great moves and aerial shots.
You can choose from 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 Matches, so it's nowhere near as much players as in real football, but that's actually a good thing, even with 4v4 it can get pretty messy and chaotic...then again, that can be fun as well ^^

It's rather easy to get into the game, as you have tutorial for the basics, like handling your booster, doing aerial shots, defense etc. But that doesn't mean there is no challenge. To do those insane aerial maneuvers, you'll need quite some training.

The Main Motivation comes from being a competitive game, either via ranked games or normal matches against other players. There is also a single-player mode, but that's more for practicing and getting into the game than a selling point for the game.
You can also unlock stuff for your car, like hats, booster color, tires and patterns to put onto your car.

I've never been a big fan of either genre, yet Rocket League manages to pull me in and gets me excited about every match i play. Even if you're playing with random people, it's not that bad and you can have quite some fun, though having a good team which is working good together would be the most fun.

So, hope to see some of you on the field :)"

If you want a game that you can pickup and play with friends for 5 minutes and have fun, this is the game for you.

If you want a game with devs that listen, give you what you want, and then give you stuff you didn't know that you wanted, this is the game for you."

												Rocket League is a vehicle based football game developed by Psyonix. In Rocket League you get behind the wheel of one of a number of different cars and face off against up to 4 opponents in an effort to hit a giant football in to the opposing team's goal. Enjoyable in solo play, local multiplayer and online matchmaking you can either play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 and even unbalanced matches! (only available in offline exhibition mode).

+Great graphics and visual effects
+A wide range of customisation options unlocked as you complete matches
+There's a season mode if you wish to play solo so you don't have to just play exhibition games repeatedly, the season mode is actually pretty good and features a number of different options which make it more interesting
+Local multiplayer supports up to four players (providing you have enough controllers)
+A number of different maps, each with several time and weather variations
+Cross-platform multiplayer with PS4 players (though the party system currently doesn't work when doing cross-platform matches)
+Rocket League features some quick messages which get assigned to your controller's hat switch allowing you to communicate quickly with your teammates
+You can save the replays of your matches to watch back later
+Obviously it has full controller support for 360 controllers as well as Xbox One controllers and the controls are fantastic
+It's even entertaining for those of us who aren't keen on playing sports games
+Your car's top speed is considerably higher on a pitch made of tarmac compared to a grass pitch, it's not a major feature but it's certainly a nice touch
+As mentioned earlier you can play unbalanced matches when playing offline exhibition, they provide and extra layer of challenge and are great fun when playing local multiplayer

+/-The game's bots aren't great but this game is best enjoyed by playing multiplayer anyway

-Solo play gets pretty repetitive

Verdict:
An Essential Purchase (9.5/10)

Rocket League is an incredibly good multiplayer game with great visuals, lots of customisation options and a number of different maps. If you're looking for a new multiplayer game or just something a bit different, you've come to the right place.

No drama, Just Reviews.

												This game is amazing. In spite of having a high skill ceiling, it is very fun at every skill level. 1v1's are very exciting to measure up individual skills and mind tricks, 2v2s and 3v3s are awesome to team up with your friends (and even randoms), 4v4s are waaay too crazy for my taste but can also be fun.

The newest update included mutators, and they are hilarious to play with friends.

Everything is well done, the gameplay, the graphics, and the mechanics. Even the DLC is well done; they're just cosmetic, they're cool, and they're cheap (Back to the Future DLC).

The developer keeps the game updated with free maps, cosmetic stuff and game modes too.

My only complaint is that it should have a custom training mode, where you can move the ball launcher around, disable goal replay, disable infinite boost, etc...

This will be my favorite game for quite some time for sure."

												Detailed Review by Ashes

SummaryRocket League is a multiplayer soccer game with rocket cars instead of human players developed by Psyonix and a sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. It includes a range of different cars, arenas, cosmetics and gets constant updates which add new content, tweaks and bug fixes.

Cars and all the different unlockables are purely cosmetic and make absolutely no difference in gameplay, all of the new arenas are free which means the community does not get divided when new ones come out. The currently released paid dlc packs are simply cosmetic items and do not change gameplay or give any advantages to the buyers beside bragging rights.

One thing that I like a fair lot is that there are no gimmicks and no unlockable advantages.  Everything you have in Rocket League, you have from the beginning itself and the only important factor is your skill. This is how competitive games should be made. Nothing makes a player who has more hours superior to you except his skill, it's plain and simple.

GameplayRocket League is fairly easy to learn, but oh god is it hard to master. You can drive around, use your boost, jump, propel your car into the air with the boost, launch your car forward or in any other major direction and one often overlooked feature is the ability to spin your car around in mid air.

There are several match types: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4. Each of them excluding the 4v4 have ranked versions if you feel extra competitive. When a match starts you spawn at one of several possible locations on the arena and the ball spawns at the center. Both teams rush to the ball for the first hit. Like in traditional football there is one goal on each side of the field and the objective is to score into the enemy team's goal while protecting your own. Scattered through the arena are boost fill-ups which can be picked up from both sides of the field regardless of your team.

In terms of competitiveness Rocket League nails it, the complete lack of perks and upgrades make the outcome of matches rely purely on your skill and a hint of luck every now and then. Gameplay is exceptionally fun and enjoyable, you'll probably spend your first few matches hopelessly driving around the field not even touching the ball, but after a while you'll eventually get the hang of it and learn when to go for the ball, when to strike and how to position yourself among a lot of other things. As silly as the concept of rocket car football might sound, Rocket League is a very competitive game which even managed to secure its position as an electronic sport.

The way a match progresses is fairly simple and much like real life football. After every goal the players and ball reset and both teams rush towards the ball for the first hit much like in the beginning of the game. If you end up tying a match overtime takes place and the first team to score wins. Overtime doesn't have any sort of time limit so a match can go on until your fingers fall off and your eyes melt.

Matches are a team based effort and while it may be easy to win one of them in lower ranks without being a team player you will find that without proper communication and strategy you cannot win in the higher ranks. This brings me to another point, one particularly frustrating thing is that players can abandon matches without any form of punishment and to make matters even worse when a player leaves a ranked match no new player can connect in his/her place, which makes you are stuck with a bot. A system that punishes people for leaving games would be very welcome.

Arenas, Cars and Car CustomizationThere are 5 different arenas and each of them has its own theme and some have different variations, but note that they do not affect gameplay whatsoever, but instead offer a nice and welcome change of scenery. All of them have a lot of detail and provide you with loads of eye candy.

Different cars offer completely cosmetic changes and so do car customization options. There is a total of 14 cars including the dlc ones so far and more than a few hats, wheel types, boost effects etc., the only thing lacking variety are the decals. Unfortunately there are only 5 decals per car and the game doesn't let you move them around your car or re-size them in any way, but you can change their color.

Graphics and SoundRocket League is absolutely gorgeous offering a lot of detail in both graphical and sound quality. The game is so detailed that you can literally see each individual piece of grass on the field. The soundtrack is perfect for a sports game like this and the sound effects are absolutely nailed. There are a lot of small details everywhere and if you have a powerful enough PC to max this game out you will surely be astonished by its graphical beauty.

A very small, but nice little detail I've noticed is that each type of boost effect has its own different sound effect. Every time a goal is scored the ball explodes in a mixture of paint and fireworks and lets out a very satisfying explosion sound. As much as I try I can't find anything to complain about regarding the graphics and sound of this game.

Technical DetailsRocket League is very well optimized, has no fps lock and a constant reliable framerate, a full PC interface and it supports gamepads, it has more than enough graphical, sound and game options. You can fully rebind your keys with both keyboards and controllers. I have to warn people with weaker or/and older systems that it might be difficult for them to run the game even at lower settings because it's pretty demanding. 

Everything you'd expect to be included in a game like this already is. We have cross-platform play with PlayStation users as well as split screen co-op on PC. After playing this for a fair bit of time, I even think that the PC version was simultaneously developed with the PS4 one instead of being ported, correct me if I'm wrong.

All bugs and problems usually get fixed withing a span of several days and the game is constantly supported by the devs. One of my only problems with Rocket League is its servers. Sometimes, despite having really low ping I get disconnected or start lagging all over the place. This can be especially frustrating in ranked matches where losing can lower the rank you've worked so hard to reach.

ConclusionI've enjoyed all of my time playing this. It was incredibly fun to play with random people online, but even more fun with my friends. Gameplay is spot on, PC version is amazing and probably better than the console one, every feature I would want is implemented and the whole thing is just beautiful.

This sort of purely skill-based gameplay is what more competitive games should be. No perks, no nuttin'. Just you and your team against the opposing team. Matches are short and intense and there is no big learning curve which means the game is really easy to get into for newcomers.

I recommend this to anyone. If you are just looking for something casual and fun you'll definitely like it and if you are looking for something competitive and hard to master you're just bound to love it.

PROS
Skill-based gameplay
Exceptionally fun
Easy to learn, hard to master
Infinite replayability
A decent selection of cars
A lot of customization options excluding decals
Mindblowingly beautiful graphics and great soundtrack
Great fun with friends
Cross-platform play and split-screen
PC version is amazing
CONS
Servers aren't that great
A sparse selection of decals for cars
Demanding system requirements
No punishment for players abandoning matches
When someone leaves a ranked match no one can connect in his/her place"

												Rocket League:
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Have you ever imagined in your wildest dreams combining indoor Soccer (Football) and Mattel cars? Well, someone did just that and came up with “Rocket League!” 

Turn on your engine and jump into a 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3 or even a 4 vs 4 online to score the goal of the season! It is just a mad house this game and I would strongly recommend to go through the tutorial to give you the heads up. 

Use your power up to pick up speed and launch your car into the air attempting a 360 degree frontward flip and strike this huge ball at the perfect angle to score a goal. But wait, your teammates are trying to do exactly the same thing and you all miss the ball! Now you have to drive back to defend your own net and hope that your opponents are as skilful as you are. 

You will accumulate points by scoring goals, clearing the balls, passing the ball in the centre, making an assist or, like myself, manage to do a hat trick. And to be honest, it was a fluke! Still, I managed to be the man of the match! Sorry, let me rephrase that -  I managed to be the car of the match! These points will help you to unlock new cars, wheels, paints, hats(???). Yes hats and other stuff.

The graphics are very good and the gameplay is fantastic. Great physics!

One small downside is the frequent connection issue. I do not get kicked out of the game but keep missing out my goal of the season!

Positives:
~~~~~~~  

-	Great graphics and physics
-	Easy to access an online game
-	Innovative and fun to play
-	Trading cards
-	Achievements

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~  

-	Frequent connection issue 

Whoever came up with this idea is a mad genius!

10/10 (even with the connection issue)

												This game makes soccer (football) extremely fun due to being a car with rockets. You will learn to control your car to hit the ball in various angles. Then you will jump and hit the ball and using your second jump (or dodge depending on direction) to navigate the battlefield or hit the ball harder. Then you will learn the beautiful art of rocket ballet as you use your boost to fly for short periods of time while scoring goals. Mix all those elements with teamwork for a simple, yet extremely complex game filled with sick plays, amazing comebacks, and did he just score a goal flying backwards? What!?

Forget FIFA. Play Rocket League.

I should now mention that their post-launch support has been nothing short of amazing. I don't agree with their decision to include gambling boxes for cosmetics (I prefer to buy things directly), but the amount of free content and excellent modes has been substantial. Rumble has been one of the best modes they've added to the game. The other bonus modes have their own followings too. Some people just play Hockey League exclusively.

Rocket League has incredibly fun gameplay and is backed by a great developer. I just hope they avoid becoming a money hungry monster, but they've been doing a splendid job so far.

They've added a training mode where you can create playlists of different shots for scoring or defending. This is the best addition to the game since Rumble and is incredibly fun to play. I enjoy both making and experiencing what others have created."

												Very rarely will I play a game that is as engrossing as Rocket League.

I bought it with the idea of playing it for 30 minutes or so before heading out for the weekend.

Almost 3 hours later I'm still playing it, and I want to play it more.

It is just plain FUN, something I feel that has been missing from the majority of games that I have played recently.

If the idea of rocket flying cars playing destruction derby football in massive stadiums appeals to you then...

												Rocket-controlled autos flipping through the air in Thunderdome-esque matches of fenced in range soccer sounds like the indiscernible ramblings of a psycho, yet it winds up being sufficiently insane to work. Psyonix's Rocket League, the follow up to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, finds imbecilic fun in pulling turbocharge-fronted flips in a baked good truck, and the white-knuckle framework in working with your social occasion to control the mammoth ball on offense and resistance. The smart and liquid ludicrousness of Rocket League wires into an authentic respectable time – paying little personality to servers that now and again work perfectly. 

The crucial mode puts two social events of three in obviously differing however execution unclear vehicles (however 1v1, 2v2, and 4v4 assortments exist) as they race here and there the pitch looking for after the class' greater than typical likeness a soccer ball. The goliath thing is, you don't have to know anything about driving diversions or soccer to play. The models are basic: drive really energetic around glorious, flickering, neon shaded fields and do bolster traps while trying to crush a never-endingly ricocheting ball into a misleadingly tight space. 

The heart of Rocket League lives in that thought unfathomable change. It's thanks in wide part to the utilization of what I would call ""material science in any case,"" where the laws of gravity and essentialness get a splendid climb to think about driving on the dividers and housetop, and unconventional mid-air heading changes that would condense the driver in this present reality. By the by, its astounding change is so arcadey and fulfilling that I reliably need to remind myself to pump the brakes or lay off the traps when an immediate push or pound will do. 

Furthermore, those traps are the principle surface-scratching look at Rocket League's layer of philosophy under the unmistakably tumultuous squashing of metal. Tapping your ricochet get places you unmistakable all around, where tapping it again with a course held plays out a somersault, barrel roll, or bike kick. It may sound clear – and truly, it is – yet timing a hit to interface with a speeding ball, and controlling the course you send it cruising, down to right edges, takes some expertise. There are genuine, uncommon levels of fulfillment to be tapped when you see an accessory sorting out a shot from the corner and read the condition, pummeling on the brakes to push the ""go"" into the objective with an impeccably masterminded barrel roll. It's electric. 

Outside of the enraged and inebriating gameplay, Rocket League has deficient couple of parts to substance out the experience. The player-advancement structure – where winning matches, performing in-redirection deeds, or doing anything truly, wins you encounter – opens to some degree stable of insane vehicles or therapeutic decals and embellishments. 

It's engaging to drive a truck wearing a sombrero, without question, however since there's in every way that really matters zero mechanical refinement between the dozen or so sportsters, trucks, exotics, a couple thought models and no shy of what one hardened yogurt truck (select to PS4 players), there's no certified estimation improvement that developments how you play a match. Recollecting that is all superbly sensible for a level multiplayer playing field, I would have expected to see every auto go on the qualities and insufficiencies determined by their certifiable accessories: wear autos as snappy however difficult to-handle strikers, trucks and vans as slower yet more grounded guardians, and the adjusted yet all around advantageous roamers some place in the inside. It appears like a missed chance to incorporate a more basic association with your cars in the parking spot, particularly when making a squad to play through a whole season. 

By the by, there is an other advancement twist found in comprehending how to utilize the shocking mechanical noteworthiness of Rocket League's different controls and whimsical material science. Whether that twist takes you through online focused or arranged matches, lovely showcases, up to four-player neighborhood obliging play on split-screen, or each of the 36 weeks of a completely widened season mode, the Rocket League experience is constantly about getting into the going with throttle-pumping match. 

Recalling there are leaderboards to track your bits of learning and general limit, Rocket League servers battle to bolster the converging of PlayStation 4 and PC players seeking after for same and cross-arrange matchmaking sessions, rendering the lion's share of Rocket League's online segments – including the online party structure – spotty, most perfect circumstance. Luckily, the AI is critical on either burden setting above Rookie, both as partners and adversaries, so Rocket League doesn't lose much in a totally separated proximity, which is uncommon, since its online suite is, in a manner of speaking, unsteady. 

Rocket League is a phenomenal circumstance where the execution of a key, over the top accepted is so solid along these lines beguiling that it needn't issue with a monstrous measure of additional parts around it. The surge of tearing over the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on focus with a hold bike kick is sufficient to bring me back on different occasions for only ""one more match,"" even without basic improvement frameworks. Rocket League is a phenomenal, silly, simple to learn and hard to star development sports redirection which requests that you get a few sidekicks and play a few rounds.

												After 250 hours...
Rocket League is a multiplayer game of angles and timing. The only difference here is that you use a car to hit a ball. Playing for a long time doesn't guarantee you becoming skilled, but you'll have a solid base and hopefully don't repeat the same mistakes you made when you first started playing it. Most people will let you know about it, using chat commands sarcastically or call you whatever swear words you can think of. I don't want people to be put off by this, cos it's something you can expect from any multiplayer game, but since the teams are smaller than in FPS games, you get a bigger whiff of the hatred thrown in your direction and the guilt from making a mistake is higher, cos most games are 2v2 or 3v3. Therefore your teammates also have a lower tolerance for mistakes, so get used to losing a teammate when you mess up, even with them risking a time penalty in competitive mode. 1v3 or 2v3 matches can build character or completely throw you off your game, but that's all that Rocket League has ever been, a game of skill, not a cutesy football game with cars.

Recently they added a custom training mode, which was long overdue, cos personally I lack the imagination to grow as a player, so I need these new tutorials to get a sense of how all these tricks work and there's a lot of them. A few hundred hours ago I thought once I master aerials I will be set, but consistently executing well-timed aerials is the bare minimum of Rocket League and I can't even manage that most of the time. I swear I'm still making the same mistakes I made when I first started, cos one thing, I'm so used to using ball cam that I'm often missing shots on the ground and in the air as well. In a way, I've painted myself to a corner and I'm stuck in a limbo of ascending and descending between Prospect I and II in Solo Standard. I've actually regressed in my playstyle and stopped taking risks, which freezes your judgement and makes you prone to even more mistakes. No matter how much hatred or disappointment is expressed at your expense, never forget that the real goal here is to have fun.

All this depressing stuff aside, Rocket League is incredibly fun, otherwise I wouldn't still be playing it. You always want to get better at it. If it weren't for the incredibly responsive and accurate controls, this would not have been the success that it is. Being focused enough to anticipate every move, the trajectory of the ball and to perfectly time your shot is the entire game."

												I play this too much.

I'm sure you've already heard numerous great things about this game. I can definitely agree to them. This game screams fun regardless of if you've played 1 hour or 1000 hours. Even if you're losing, you find yourself having fun. And that's the mark of a seriously great game, in my eyes.

Rocket League can be played casually or competitively, boasting both unranked and ranked queues. It is a simple enough concept that people are already familiar with even before playing their first game (it's damn soccer dude, if you don't know you've been living under a rock very far away from Europe, possibly on the moon Europa). But then, it has such an incredibly high skillcap. You'd probably still be learning new manouevres and the like well into 2000 hours (give it time though).

I don't play with a controller as I don't own one, but I know that 99% of people recommend controller over keyboard/mouse. And from an unbiased standpoint, I would agree, as the analogs make ball control and fine movement much easier than WASD or the like. Regardless, if you do choose to play keyboard like a dummie (read: like me), then consider making a custom bind that doesn't use the mouse.

I could go on and on. But I'll let the game do the talking; go buy it. Believe me, for $20, this is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing steal. Best $20 I ever spent tbh.

10/10 would play again (actually am playing as I write this)

												I love this game!  Soccer/Football in RC cars with jets strapped to their back and an exploding ball.  The controls are tight, the action intense and it's a pulse pounding thrill ride even when you lose.

Don't get me wrong, just like with real soccer/football it's easy to play but difficult to play well.  But the training gives you the tools, you just need to practice. Highly recommended for anyone who likes action packed games with high speed thrills and crazy crashes.  

Remember when you were a kid and you were practicing catching high fly balls?  How you had to practice getting under it and timing it just right?  Get ready for that with jet cars."

												Rocket League is a great game. The core mechanics are fun and very well executed. Currently the servers don't work and I haven't been able to play online. I would easily reccomend this game for the single player alone. The only real concern I have is that it may not offer enough content to keep the community alive for any significant length of time.  

Edit* Servers are working now.

												Rocket League is an excellent game and one of my favourites. It's very easy to understand but hard to master.

Optimisation is great, and graphics are fantastic. The game also has a full controller support, but you can play with a mouse and keyboard as well, so it's up to you how you want to play. I more prefer the controller.

After the first launch of the game, you will hear a fantastic music on the menu. After that, you can choose your car. Play a tutorial, and finally, you will be ready to play your first multiplayer game.

In the game, there are a lot of cars, and you can also buy paid DLC. Cars from DLCs are technically the same. The only differences are hit boxes. According to developers, all of the cars have the same stats. Vehicles are customisable. For example, you can add an antenna, change your wheels, colour of the car, etc.

Like I wrote above Rocket League is very easy to understand because, in the main mode, the game consists of control the giant ball and try to score. To put it simply, it's just football with cars. You can choose between 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, and 4vs4. The main modes are playable on casual and competitive modes. But there are also game modes which are more advanced like for example ice hockey, basketball and my personal favourite 'RUMBLE'. In 'RUMBLE' rules are the same, but here, every ten seconds the game draws for you one special ability. For example grappling hook, a tornado and a freezer weapon.

As I mentioned above, here are competitive matches. After ten games, you will get your rank. There's  15 ranks: PROSPECT (I, II, III, Elite) CHALLENGER (I, II, III, Elite), RISING STAR, ALL-STAR, SUPERSTAR, CHAMPION, SUPER CHAMPION, GRAND CHAMPION.

The game rewards us in the form of points for all sorts of tricks, like aerials, bicycle hits, etc.


The Verdict
Rocket League is a unique game with simple rules. If you haven't bought this game yet, do it. You won't regret. My final rating is 10/10.



If you found any mistakes, something isn't right, or you just don't like this review. Instead of giving me a thumbs down, tell me what is wrong. Thank you."

												So, what makes this vehicular football game so great?

- Great gameplay
- Marvelous graphics
- Very competitive
- Alright singleplayer
- Tons of customization
- Easy to pick up, hard to master
- Up to 4-player splitscreen (!!)
- Cross-platform
+ Much more to experience for yourself!

Cons:
- Servers were pretty bad to begin with, but that's fixed now tho', so this should not count as a con.

Everything else that I would have written as a con, is currently being added, so I have no complaints about this game at all.

''Just one more game'' - everyone."

												I am a hardcore player of DotA2 and CS: Global Offensive. A Clan mate of mine introduced me rocket league just like the other games. He got a 4 Pack and shared it along with us. He used to always pm me about this game and I used to show no interest since it was looking like sonic cars or something like that game. 
After I played my 1st game which was a 3 v 3, Holy ♥♥♥♥ I was astonished about the gameplay.
Every competitve online match is just 5 minutes which is so fun. 

Rating: 10/10 ( I am a Indian, I get 124 ping always which is playable, but looking forward to play on Indian servers which might make it more IMBA) 

Thank you Psyonix for this wonderful game."

The learning curve presented here is one of the greatest I've seen in years, both rewarding and satisfying. You can actually feel and see how much better you're becoming after every single hour spent in Rocket League. Developers are pushing updates and fixes every single month, often surprising us with completely new game modes like Rumble and Hoops. Wanna hear more? All updates are free of charge! DLC's are not ""PayToWin"" contest offering small visual enhancements instead.

												Best competitive gameFootball (for US colleagues Soccer) with cars, double jumps, rotket boost in the a$$ and some level of car customization. These words can describe rocket league in whole. Oh and yes, you can play now against our console colleagues which creates really broad spectrum of talents through all the platforms so u will definetly find your place there. 
This game can be categorised as ""Easy to learn, hard to master"" game. The basics are the same, only the cars differ in some slight characteristics. It all comes to your skill. Check some of my videos on my profile of this game so you can see what all you can do there ;)

 GOOD things: 
    Fun
    Can fly and score amazing shots
    Competitive (even ranked play)
    Addictive
    Easy to learn, hard to master - skill matters
    Many mods and maps
    Teamwork over solo skill - as in every team game (tested by experience)
    Massive Replay possibilities BAD things: 
    Addictive
    Hard to climb the ranked ladder without good teammates
    Many kids and ragers - rly have to have good friends to enjoy the gameplay"

												Rocket League is a great example on how to take a simple idea  and make it an incredible game. The game is easy to get into but hard to master. At first glance it may seem that this game is just about who gets to hit the ball , but there is more to it . Ball control and tactics takes time to learn. The one major complaint i have about the game is the poor matchmaking from my experience. Either i play with people who are worse than me or people who are  way better than me , what happened to match people with similiar skillset. And the south east asia servers are ♥♥♥♥ in this game.

Everyone, welcome Rocket League to the world :)


More Thoughts on the game?

Rocket League is just a ton of fun, if you enjoy good gameplay check this out. When you have a team working together it is a thing of beauty. You might be helping out on offense alot one game, while another player might be making some great saves coming back on defense, or you all might do a little of everything, etc..

												Rocket League is a damn good game. It's fun, very addicting and the gameplay can be quite humorous at times. Just playing this game for a few minutes is relaxing and laid back. If you want to play it competitively you can, and if you don't, you can play it casually just as well. 

This game made Soccer, a sport that I personally didn't care that much for, fun for me. Rocket League, simply put, is a very entertaining game that will give you hours of constant enjoyment. Suffice it to say, I think this game is well worth your money and I, for one, am glad to have played it.

8.5/10: ""A very fun game that will leave you highly entertained and wanting for more after every single match."""

												The great thing about the beautiful game is that it's a very basic concept: Get the ball into the goal. Video games have put various spins on that concept with great results, and Rocket League joins that list.

You drive a car straight out of Speed Racer. It's got jump jacks and jet engines that you can actually use to fly for a brief period. It drives great. You can even drive along the wall. Drifting is as simple as holding down a button. Easy to use camera controls and UI elements make sure that you know where the ball is. The presentation is amazing and can get you hyped very easily. The game itself is simple to learn but with the boost system there are some very advanced techniques to figure out. Multiplayer supports 4-player splitscreen as well as 8-player online, even both at the same time. And if you're playing by your lonesome, the AI players can keep you company. Did I forget to mention this game also has crossplay with the PS4 version?

Rocket League is excellent and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's enjoyed arcade-style sports games like NBA Jam or NHL 3-on-3 Arcade."

												Simple competitive fun with lots more. 

I've become old and boring and haven't truly enjoyed playing games with strangers for nearly a decade. I just don't like being on other people's time and sitting in lobbies. I'd rather play singleplayer these days. But Rocket League brought me back into the fold. You're rarely waiting on other people. You can drop in to most modes within seconds and games are merely five minutes of clock time and pauses for goals. Its simple, quick, doesn't waste your time. I enjoy that. Not to mention the game itself is fun fun fun! And there is a subpar singleplayer even. 

I was indoctrinated with the standard ""soccer"" modes of 3v3 but as I plateau'd and didn't develop into a competitive player I branched out into the less popular modes and matchups. There's plenty here to keep people of all skill levels, shapes, and sizes happy. E-Sports level competitiveness with the ability to join with your friends right down to what I'm doing casually bouncing into 2 or 3 ""Rumble"" matches with strangers when I got the time. Rocket League did something else for me too. The PC has a barren desert in the sports genre and this mildly and subtly fills the void a little more.

They're also consistently adding new free content and updates. All the while keeping paid DLC cosmetic. I could care less about all the knick-knacks as I don't even decorate my car but its got all that item customization people like. Wheels, paints, decals, toppers(hats), etc. They even added a crate system for those so inclined. Full price might be a little steep now that they do indeed have all these other avenues of revenue but that's what sales are for and I'd recommend waiting for one. Recommended!"

												I´ve played a lot of games over the years, from MMO´s to indies to god knows what.

However never have a first impression of a game been this good. 

I sat down with 2 friends and played this game for the first time with a xbox controller and within 5-10 mins i had the best laugh i´ve had for a long time.

The game is easy to pickup and easy to learn but diffenetly something you should play with friends, the sheer joy of in fact lining up that perfect goal or getting it is a great feeling of something silly and stupid that will make you scream the ears of all your friends and wake up whoever else lives in the house.

This game is a perfect balance between silly, stupid and genius really, the music, the gameplay and the easy way of learning makes it sooo addictive that it is really just a must have for anyone who likes to have a great laugh with friends and just wanna forget everything else for a few hours.

I´m for sure gonna play this even more over the next long time as my car needs some swag ^_^"

												As a competitive gamer, it's not often I'm able to find a game that continues to be enjoyable while I'm getting getting completely dominated; but Rocket League delivers that perfectly. I've played for almost 400-hours and I have yet to figure out why, exactly, this game is so fun to so many different people from so many walks of life. But whatever the reason, Psyonix has delivered a near-flawless hybrid cross between a Single-Character-Controlled Sports game (Soccer, Hockey, Basketball), a Racing game, a Flying game, and a competitive multiplayer experience.

Pros:
- Replayability is consistent.
- Servers cover /many/ regions. (Most of the world.)
- No single Battlecar has a distinct advantage in all fields over every other Battlecar. (There are pros and cons to every Battlecar.)
- Battlecar customizability feels endless.
- Fun for casual gamers.
- Fun for competitive gamers.
- Quick 5-minute matches so you aren't forced to risk losing after 45-minutes.
- Split-screen playable Local OR Online.
- Psyonix listens to players and integrates desired features.
- This Pros list could go on and on.

Cons:
- Not the easiest game to just pick up and play.
-- New players may become discouraged by having difficulty hitting the ball at all. (Don't give up! You'll get it down relatively quickly!)
- Online players can be incredibly rude (as with any online multiplayer game).
- It takes a LOT of time to become a skilled player.
- In-game voice chat quality is unbearable. (Most players use third-party VoIP programs to avoid this issue.)

It has been years since I've found a game that has me as addicted and dedicated as I am to Psyonix's Rocket League. This is a game I'll be playing for a long, long time.

9.5/10


EDIT: Paid DLC is not completely cosmetic, as DLC Battlecars have different hitboxes and turn radiuses than base cars. This, however, does not make any paid DLC Battlecar specifically better than base Battlecars. Every Battlecar has its pros and cons between hitboxes and turn radiuses."

												Car soccer.. 

What a time to be alive.

It's a fantastic game. It's such a unique experience, and it's unfortunate that I never really took the time to play SARPBC. Apart from any game I have owned, it is a competitive multi-platform sports game that you will have copious amounts of fun playing -- Whether you're on the winning OR losing team.

This game has seen a lot of negative feedback lately due to the crate system being introduced. Personally, I never really liked the idea of it, but do keep in mind, there is absolutely no Steam Community Market involved.

Keys to unlock crates are $1.49, and the crates seem to drop fairly often. If nothing else, it's an OK way to fund further development of the game and increase prize pools for RLCS.
Those of you that are just SO upset with Psyonix about crates, and threaten to uninstall-
C'mon. We really got the best flavor of sh*t sandwich here, if sh*t has to be eaten.
The animated decals and wheels are pretty darn sweet.

Warning to all:
Parts of the community and certain individuals that you will meet can be VERY toxic and degrading in online matches.
That's pretty much the internet for you, but I feel that it stems from something more specific;
A lot of CS:GO diehards play this on the side with their clanmates, and that kind of vindictive and immature mentality leaks in to this game due to the competitive nature.

In closing..

Bring some friends, keep your ballchasing to a minimum, and dive in to this game.
Prepare for a wild learning curve and a boatload of fun."

												OK first of all its a shame that most negative reviews are based on first 2 days after release where the team of devs had some problems with the servers. They worked day an night and now everything is working fine at least for me.

So, i played this game on Beta on PS4 and i was pretty hyped about the launch. It didn't disapoint. I have it for free on PS4 and bought it on steam to play with friends.

The game is a ton of fun. The gameplay is easy to learn, hard to master.
Graphics are pretty nice and cars come with a ton of costumization options (FOR FREE).
We can face AI opponents with diferente skill levels (that can make a huge diference) or we can play vs players usually with simillar skill (sometimes u can face players really better than u but their in game rate is the same or lower than yours).
There are several game modes but the only major difference is the amount of players and ranked match or not.
Its great to play with friends. Hard to quit playing even if you're really tired.
I seriously recomend using a controller. I use my DS4 with Bluetooth (using inputmapper) and it works perfectly. For ppl using other controllers i recomend x360ce (helped 2 friend who were using a ds2 and a sega saturn controller).

A word also for the devs that seem to work night and day to fix problems. Keep up the  good work.

Great game. One of the better for sure to release this year."

												Do you have 5 minutes to play a match of Rocket League? Just five minutes of fast, exciting, and competitive action. Three hours later, you’ll find time for another match. Rocket League is a fantastic multiplayer game with simple mechanics and a tremendous learning curve. It is easy to play and hard to master. You drive a rocket car and hit a ball into a goal. On a basic level it requires timing hits, simple passing, and good positioning. More advanced techniques include aerials, dribbling and pinching. Hitting goals is satisfying but you are always searching for that perfect match with good cooperation. With many skills to master, it is a game that provides reward after many hours. While there is some luck involved, such as when balls are contested, skill usually wins out. Rocket League is a game of exceptional value and you only need 5 spare minutes."

												What's in a Name?

Naming sequels should be a straight forward process shouldn't it?
You can use the same name of the original and just slap a number on the end (or if you're going for ""Artsy"" a roman numeral for extra gravitas).

Sometimes people try to overcomplicate things unnecessarily which annoys me.

I can get on board with the whole, Alien, Aliens, Alien3 thing,

I've even made my peace with the Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 fiasco
(Did they make a Windows 9? and was it so bad they had to lock it in the attic to hide it from the neighbours and feed it fish heads in a bucket when no one's looking?)

Anyway some naming systems for sequels defy logic, SimCity, SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, SimCity 4 then back to SimCity again... that's just crazy!
It's either SimCity 5 or SimCity 5000.
Have a little consistency people!
(not that is really matters, SimCity 5 was crappy anyway).


What's in a Name II ?

But there are exceptions where I can forgive a sequel for not carrying the burden of its ancestors name.

For instance, do you remember a game called ""Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars?""
Me neither and as such I'd be unlikely to show much interest in a title called ""Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars 2""
(Even typing a title as long of that makes me sad).

However a game I have been playing recently (and thoroughly enjoying) has been the snappily titled ""Rocket League"" which the Steam store page confidently tells me is the sequel to the previously mentioned (and ridiculously named) battle-cars game.

So as I said, had Rocket League been released as ""Blah, Blah, Blah-Blah Blah-Cars 2"" I'm convinced I would have avoided the title and missed out on a gem!

But thankfully it wasn't and I didn't so here we are now!


What's in a Name III ?

Rocket League is a deceptively simple arcade, car racing and football (or soccer to our American friends) mash-up.

As a side note, I've never understood why American Football is called ""Football"", they play the ball with their hands right? so is it called football because handball was already taken?
Also, because the label ""football"" is (rightly or wrongly) used for a game played with your hands it results in a sport which is actually played with foot and ball being called ""soccer"".... it's not important but it does boggle my little mind.

Anyway... back to Rocket League.


Simple Soccer

The Football part of the mash up is a simplified version of ""the beautiful game"".
Each match takes place in a caged stadium so there's no need to worry about the ball going out of play, there are no corners or throw-ins, no fouls or offside rules, it's ""soccer"" boiled down to its purest form.
As you'd expect, there's a goal at each end of the pitch and one giant ♥♥♥ ball (it's bigger than the cars!) that you need to knock around the field.

Each match only lasts for 5 minutes but with most of the interruptions that slow down a regular footy match removed it makes for a frantic, adrenaline fuelled 5 minutes of non-stop action.
There are different stadiums to choose from too, you can even pick up more by way of DLC to keep the background looking fresh if you feel the need.


The Drive to Win

The driving side of the mash-up is where Rocket League really shines.
Gone are the egoistical, under-educated but overpaid human players that ""show-boat"" around the pitch during a ""real"" football match, here we have cars, gorgeous, acrobatic  rocket powered cars!
Winning games will unlock a whole wealth of upgrades and adornments for your vehicle too.
There are hats, flags, wheels, decals, you can even change the colour of the smoke that spews out the back when you fire up your rockets and hurtle across the arena.

These  customisation options are a huge amount of fun and give your chosen vehicle an element of individuality when you're playing (and if you're as talentless as myself, losing) against your peers online.
Maybe those go faster stripes really will make a difference in the next match...   (I need all the help I can get!)


Ball Control

As a football simulation Rocket League is a great driving game.
The handling of the various vehicles is surprisingly good and complimented by a very intuitive set of controls.
You'll need to dust off your game pad to get the most out of Rocket League, but it's totally worth it!
It's rare that I play a game where the controls feel so dialled in and natural.
It doesn't take long before you're hitting the controls without thought to make the car jump, flip and spin on command, of course doing this in the right location to make the ball go where you want is another matter.

""Easy to learn, hard to master"" are six words that definitely apply to Rocket League.


Tyre-Ball

The game itself is fantastic to play,  you can choose between intimate 1v1 matches all the way up to the mayhem you'll experience in a chaotic 5v5 match.
With a little (or maybe a lot) of practice you'll find yourself sliding and skidding your vehicle into position to intercept, pass and shoot the ball.

It's a great feeling when you manage to pull off an impressive move (whether accidental or not) and leaping your car into the air to nudge a high flying ball into your opponents goal is soooo satisfying, especially in an online match when you've got a real audience to admire you car-ball prowess.

There's a tutorial and single player mode too which are both vital if you want to learn the ropes before you take your newly fledged ""tyre-ball"" talents online.
If I could give you some advice to avoid annoying others and embarrassing yourself when you first fire up Rocket League it would be this:

""Practice before you start playing online!""
(Hey, that's six words again, spooky!)


Hear Me Roar!

So we know the game plays well, but what are the aesthetics like?
Well, the arenas are all beautiful and provide a pretty backdrop which you'll probably hardly notice as you zoom around the pitch.

The vehicles themselves are bright and varied with some neat customisation options (although I'm sad to say that ""go-faster stripes"" did not make me a better player).

The sound is of a high standard too, from the roar of the engines to the roar of the crowd, the atmosphere created by the audio gives the game an energy and intensity which heightens the whole experience.

Rocket League looks and sounds great!
(yes, I'm doing the six words thing on purpose now.)


What's in a name IV ? 

But can I sum rocket league up in six words?
hmmm...

Well there are cars battling to win the ball, let's call them battle-cars, they're rocket powered, maybe even supersonic and they are definitely acrobatic....

Maybe something like

""Supersonic Rocket Powered Acrobatic Battle Cars...""

although that does sound familiar...
It'd be a great name for a game though...

Wouldn't it?


Final Whistle

Whatever you want to call it, Rocket League is a polished, intuitive and extremely addictive alternative sports title.
I'm having a blast with it!

But remember, if you do come and join the fun (and you should) and if you encounter a player online with an unprecedented lack of skill (and go-faster stripes), take it easy on them...

It might be me!

												Rocket League;
The only game where you can 
Be a girl and scream like a dude when hitting a pole
Make goals frequantly while doing backflips
Making back and front flips
Scream your lungs out
Laugh even though you cry in the inside for missing the goal
Get assist for not doing anything

And last of all;
You are a flying battlepowered car who can has a rainbow boost...

Its fun with a lot of friends. When playing alone it gets boring. Achievements and products are easily gotten though."

												Rocket league is a fun game to play with friends online as a team and get some goals or saves.
Cant wait for later updates

Updated Review:
Game is still fun to play and im getting better at the game 1 step at a time. Connections to the server is good at 90ms ping but sometimes goes over 300ms which makes it a little hard to play but still playable.

I reccomend this to anyone who likes cars and soccer. Its reccomened to use a controller but i use both keyboard and controller. Its best to play with friends so you can have a better team that you can talk to using a mic. I will be recording this sometime to upload to youtube :D

In conclusion i give this game a thumbs up 

Edit: i have bought all the dlcs so far and they are all worth buying if you got spare money 

P.S: if you found this review helpful give it a thumbs up so otthers can see this review :P

This is still an amazing game"

There are some really cool custom items to put on your car to make it look awesome plus the DLCs don't cost alot either. I can play this game for hours on end without getting bored. I highly recommend this game to buy and have fun with even if you don't like football or cars.

												Rocket League is less of a ""sports game"" and more of an actual sport. In FIFA or Madden you have a ""pass"" button, but to make a pass in Rocket League you have to drive your car into the ball at the right speed and angle to send it over to where your teammate is going. You have to create the pass yourself, and it can be anything, from a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defender. 

Passing, shooting, dribbling, tackles, jukes, they're all in the game, but you  have to make them happen yourself, not just press the right button. At first, just driving car to ball is a challenge, but as your skill grows, the freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything you'll find in a ""sports game"". Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ball, you'll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense. 

There are very few games that are consistently rewarding for hundreds or thousands of hours, that can keep challenging you as you improve, and improve, and improve beyond what you ever imagined you'd be capable of. In fact, this is the ONLY one I know. 

Best.

Game.

Ever."

TL:DR
A rather unique idea of cars and football (or soccer) together to create one of the best competitive games ever made. If you're someone like me, who doesn't like cars or football, you may be put off by this at first, but it's definitely not what it seems, it's no wonder it's so popular. Definitely worth it!

Now for the full review

Rocket League is a game where you drive around in a rocket powered car trying to score goals. Sounds boring doesn't it? It really isn't. Rocket League suprised me. It's not one of those generic sports games I was anticipating it to be. It's a really addicting and competitive game. The game is highly physics based, meaning you'll see cars jumping and flying around. Realistic!

Your team can have up to at least 4 players, with matches lasting five minutes. The goal is basically what you do in football/soccer, score goals. The team with the most goals wins. This can be a challenge sometimes as it does require team-work, unless it's 1 v 1. There definitely isn't a shortage of players, with thousands of players on Steam AND it's cross platform capability with players from the PS4, which isn't really seen that much in games. Finding a game shouldn't be too difficult either, the matchmaking system's perfect.

The game highly advises you to use a controller, except when I started playing, my controller stopped working, so I resorted to using the keyboard. Honestly, it wasn't that hard for me to adapt. It does take time, for some people, but after that the controls become pretty simple, though I would still recommend using a controller, as there are plenty of people who struggle with the keyboard and mouse.

The game isn't just multiplayer, there is a single player and a co-op mode. In single player, you are able to access a mode called Season. This puts you with your own unique team, and places you in a tournament against bots. I haven't really played much of it but it seemed pretty simple. If you want the most out of your money I would stick to the multiplayer as it's much more entertaining and challenging.

There are quite a few different maps in Rocket League. Each one looks amazing and colourful, with quite a bit of background detail which isn't a suprise due to it being made on Unreal Engine 3. Despite all the activity going on in the match, performance was never an issue. This game runs rather smooth for what it is. 

There are different types of cars, all of which are fully customizable, ranging from colours to patterns to wheels etc. You can unlock these different customizations from completing matches. Not to mention, there's plenty of dlc that add different cars and customization items, that have quite reasonable price tags.

Rocket League is one of those games where you can loose track of time playing it, and I'm glad I replayed it after months of it sitting around in my library. It's highly addicting and I can see why it's so popular. It also has such an amazing soundtrack that plays in the background of the main menu, with some really memorable songs. If you have spare money, I'd definitely say this is worth it, a near flawless game. The DLC seems quite reasonable as well.

Pros- Highly addicting
- Amazing detail
- Highly customizable
- Great performance
- Amazing soundtrack

Cons- Problems with keyboard controls

												Amazing game.

This game is so dynamic and energetic, not a second is spent bored. Non stop action with your team, always edging to get the game deciding nudge, whether it be defense or attack. You spend hours, upon hours, getting addicted and mastering your skills. 

This game will make it to the massive multiplayer leagues. Rocket League will improve once they get proper class ranks, gained through playing ranked matches. 

Rocket League also features in depth customisation, allowing the user to ultimately customise their vehicle. This allows uniqueness, and a great ton of laughter.

Graphics of this game is amazing. If your computer isn't the best then you'll have to turn down the graphics a little, but your PC doesn't need to be expensive to play the game on great graphics. Decent laptops can even play this game decently.

This game is honestly a 9/10. Rocket League has the graphics, the dynamic energetic gameplay, the competitive experience in multiplayer and more."

Also, i didn't experience a single fps drop. The game is as smooth as it can be

												If you're looking for a great game to play online with others, either casually or competitively, or just to have a good time with some friends, there probably isn't a better choice than Rocket League. - It's fun, fast paced, hectic, hilarious, and both challenging, yet simple, all at the same time.
 
It doesn't matter if you only play games that are on the simple side, or ones that are extremely difficult. It really is the sort of game that just about everyone could have a great time playing, and you don't even have to be good at it, or like sports. 
 
The only real downside to this game, if you do intend to play online, is the terrible nature of the community (like with most online games). It's probably best just to disable both voice and text chat in the options, as almost nobody says anything of value. Even the quick-chat is highly abused and used by players mostly just to taunt and harass others. 
 

It really is a must-buy, though, especially if you're looking for a fun game that actually has an active player base."

												LAUNCH WEEK WARNING: The game servers are having problems at the moment, and when they're down you're stuck to offline play. If you're only buying this for multiplayer, I recommend waiting until the devs sort things out.

Vehicular Football/Soccer is not something one usually thinks about, so it's not something one would imagine they need in their life.

In a single match of Rocket League, I learned that it's something most people need more of in their lives. I still have much more to experience out of this game, so I may update the review as I go. As it stands, Rocket League is an incredibly fun indie racing-sports game. You are a car/truck, and you play football/soccer by driving into a giant bouncy ball. You have rocket boosters. You have vertical jump boosters. You can wall climb, ceiling crawl, bicycle kick, and sometimes explode.

Rocket League is the embodiment of ""Easy to learn, difficult to master"" gameplay. This means it is very accessible, but there's skills you can work on to improve your game. If you play just one match of Rocket League, you'll know how to play all the basics. For the advanced, there's learning better ball control with double-tapping, flying, and so on.

Teamwork is absolutely effective. Get this, get your friends to get this, join a party and play as a team. Just like actual football/soccer! With flying, exploding, spinning, rocket cars.

I'm still working through the game's content. There's offline exhibition games, a Season mode, online play, and tutorials. I'm hoping for some really intense online bracket tournaments involving multiple teams, but so far I've only played regular online matches. There's also local split-screen play, and cross-play with PS4 players! As of right now, I feel like most players are PS4 online, because no one seems to use the chat at all.

I have one small gripe, but it may just tie in to the server troubles mentioned above: the matchmaking could be better. The matchmaking system is competent when it first sets a game up, but if a player drops, it doesn't seem to try to bring new players in. If a whole team leaves after a match, sometimes it will hang on the matchmaking for so long, it's faster for your team to just quit that match and create a whole new match, with new matchmaking that works. But bear this workaround in mind, and you can avoid those waiting periods.

Update Edit: Although there's no traditional dedicated server listings, you can setup Private Matches with just your buddies or what not. Retracted that comment from matchmaking gripes.

Just pure, nonsensical, sporting good times to be had here. A must have unless you despise racing, or sports, but honestly, you might even find yourself having a good time then too.

To think that I spent 2 years hyping over Batman: Arkham Knight, and that whole ♥♥♥♥♥torm goes down, and I have more fun with Rocket League in fifteen minutes than I probably ever will with that game. And for only $20."

												This is one of those games that grabbed my attention.  I saw it on the front page of Steam and decided to give it a go.  I had some work to do one fair evening but I wanted to do a little game first.  I played one round and was absolutley terrible.  I had to get better!  So I tried again, and again, and again, and again, and again.  Now 4 hours later I haven't got any work done.  Thanks Rocket League.

Seriously though, this game is ADDICTING.   The controls are super tight on an Xbox 360 controller.  Every precise movement counts when going for a goal.  Easy game to pick up but has a very high skill ceiling.  Honestly, I can see this becoming an eSport.  It is that competitve."

												Psyonix's magnum opus, Rocket League, is one of the most fun games I've had the joy to play. The master of fast-paced, addictive gameplay, the 5 minute matches keep you playing into the early hours of the morning and never failing to keep the action above 60mph! The vertical flexability that the openness of a Rocket League pitch offers is incredible, boasting a Cirque de liberté for you to perform all sorts of zany twists and turns in mid-air, it's remarkable to see glorious goals and superb saves made by some of the insanely talented players. One can better their Rocket League play naturally, by simply enjoying the game, however, the more difficult tricks like; airials, freestyles, dribbling and perfect positioning take some serious skill and precision and are a sight to see in competitive play. The game's perfectly playable with either a controller or mouse 'n' keyboard, so it's up to you to decide how you play. The customisation is great, fine-tuning your Rocket-Powered Battle-Car is fantastic and the options are near endless, offering plenty of choice. However, there is microtransactions. But, these are implemented in one of the best ways I've seen in any game, they're not intrusive or necessary for victory AT ALL, they're simply cosmetic. The free Rumble gamemode is serious fun and it's nice to see the devs frequently adding new features and stadiums to one of the most fun games of 2015. I don't care too much for either cars or football, but I adore Rocket League. Totally worth its full price and it's a steal on sale, highly recommended."

												Game was fun, this last patch has destroyed the competitive mode. Its randomly throws people in it. They have forced bad maps into the competitive matches and its just ruined the spirit of it all.
They have changed the POV settings and the speeds are off somewhat as it was during Seasons 1 and 2."

												This one is a masterpiece, shining like a diamond in my Steam Collection. Soccer with cars? Why not! The learning curve presented here is one of the greatest I've seen in years, both rewarding and satisfying. You can actually feel and see how much better you're becoming after every single hour spent in Rocket League. Developers are pushing updates and fixes every single month, often surprising us with completely new game modes like Rumble and Hoops. Wanna hear more? All updates are free of charge! DLC's are not ""PayToWin"" contest offering small visual enhancements instead.

tl;dr BEST. GAME. EVER.
Buy ASAP"

												A really fun and addicting game, that is easy to get into but hard to master. I wish I had played this when released already :), but better later than never :D. A game about cars flying mindlessly after a ball. I've played around 25h and still have so much to get better at lol, like doing high flying or wall jumps. 
I've been playing football and racing games for many times and this is different in a cool way. Lots of skin customizations for your cars, ranks, awesome OST and different game modes. Most enjoyable to play with friends <(^_^)>.

The matchmaking sometimes adds pretty high ranked opponents. It's good practice though to play against those.

												Rocket League is an immensely fun game. It is easy to get into and will draw you in from the get-go.
RL is great for casual play if you want to just have some quick fun, and has a very high skill ceiling for those that like to invest the time and effort into their competitive games.
I usually judge games based off a price to play time ratio, and this game is well worth the $20 if you ask me."

												I was recommended this game after offhandedly mentioning it to a friend, and it ended up being one of my favourite games of the year.  Where to start? It's multiplayer focused football with cars. Some people seem to dismiss it as a simple game that will get boring fast, but I would disagree. The game's core mechanics are so well polished that playing feels fluid and natural from the get-go, especially if you play racing games. The car handling is very simple, nothing like the likes of GRID or GTA IV. I think this handling system is good for the game, complex handling mechanics (gear systems, realistic turning, etc) would probably hamper the experience, when the game can be very fast paced and precision heavy at times. At higher levels of play you will use your boost to fly through the air, tilting your car to direct it towards the ball in mid-air. This requires practice and precision, and is very satisfying when executed correctly. This game has a high skill ceiling in that regard, where goals and saves can be pulled off, and the difficulty of them can skyrocket depending on the situation.

The multiplayer is good, there are dedicated servers, in fact ONLY dedicated servers, which is something I've never really come to think about. The game modes range from 4v4, 3v3, 2v2 to 1v1. All are different in how they are played, but 3v3 is the mode I play the most and the mode that is considered ""standard"" in the game. In 3v3 you can learn about player rotation on the pitch, defensive roles, attacking roles and backup roles. Look these up on the steam guides if you are curious. The servers are split into casual and ranked games, where casual games do not impact your MMR or ""elo"" but do give you EXP and affect your all-time stats, and ranked games will impact your ranked points and MMR as well as your all-time stats. The ranked system uses points to monitor progress, starting at around 200, and you gain points on victory and lose them when you lose a match. I play this game alone mostly, and an issue I have with casual games were teamstacking in 3v3 games, where I would be matched against 3 players who were all friends, and the games would be fairly one-sided from having to play against a team that most likely communicated their play amongst themsleves. Since switching to ranked games I have not felt the urge to go back, there is even a mode called ""Solo Standard"" which is exclusively for single players looking to play 3v3 without the worries of facing a coordinated team.

Teamplay is a large part of rocket league, all modes except 1v1 require coordination to be played well, perhaps with the exception of 4v4 mode appropriately named ""Chaos"" where there are so many cars that strategy and balance dips from having too many cars on the pitch at once. You will have to learn simple things like proper round start etiquitte, player rotation, setting up passes, scoring goals from passes, scoring aerials, outmaneuvering the opponent, and so on. The community is a mixed bag, sometimes you will encounter jerks who spam chat-commands ironically, sometimes you will have a pleasant game full of sportsmanlike players. So not that different from most other communities, I'd say. You can even turn text chat off if you want to.

Overall I can say that this game is one of my favourite games of the year, and I will continue to play it... indefinetely? Maybe."

												If you want a new type of game, none of that Moba/FPS crap you have played on multiple different games but yet it still feels the same then Rocket League is a new game you can learn and have a bit of fun with. If you think that you won't like this because you hate football then trust me I thought the same thing but as soon as you start trying to jump and hit that ball in the net with your car you are going to forget about what you first thought about the game and love the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. 

-Unique Idea
-DLC Cars look awesome (a bit costly if you hunt achievments as you will need all of the DLC for them)
-Taught me ball control

The only thing I find a bit meh about this game is that you have to spend money on the keys for crates which is alright I guess if you would like a chance at the rare items but not my kind of thing."

It's very easy for anyone to pick it up and play, but the depth of the mechanics of the game offer a wide range of skilled players.

												The proof  that a game doesn't need to be mechanically complex to be compelling. Rocket Leauge is as simple as video games get. But it's tweaked and polished to perfection, making every moment all kill and no fill. And when the game is at it's best moments, whether it be the tense stand offs when all the players rush for the ball at kickoff or 30 seconds left on the clock with a tied scoreboard. It can be genuinely hard to put down. It harks back to simpler times, when video games didn’t need a billion bells and whistles to keep players interested. They just needed great design, and that’s exactly what you get with Rocket League. Soccer with cars. And it's beautiful."

												This game is as addicting as FIFA soccer is. I do however recommend it with prudence. This game is action packed but can be seen simplistic by a few.

I've played the game back in alpha and didn't much care for it. I like it now more than previously, which is an extremely good thing.

Rocket league is a soccer game played with RC cars. Obviously, the goal is to get the ball into the opponents net. Cars are given a few abilities to mix up the game. They can easily scale and drive on walls, and even up side down on the roof for a period of time (or longer with enough turbo). Boost or turbo is another feature in game. To acquire turbo, players must drive over small hot spots spread throughout the terrain. Some hot spots give minor turbo boosts while others will fill up the gauge all the way. Boosts when timed correctly, can produce a power hit on the ball. Some boosts when held down for a certain amount of time engage in some sort of ultra speed. When going this fast and if a player is in your way, you have the ability to literally run through and destroy the opponent. 

I am a huge fan of games which feature double jump, and rocket league has it! The first jump is a bit of a slow jump, while the second provides for another boost upwards, forwards, to the side or in reverse. While in the air, the player has quite a bit of flexibility to move about. This trick comes in hand when attempting to defend or attempting to knock the ball in an awkward angle. It can look pretty cool when done right. There are no power-ups within the games so this fact alone may turn a few people away from the game... this is only of course if you play competitive. Non-competitive games feature power-ups. None the less, the devs took a simplistic approach to keep the game engaging. The matchmaking that is available is organized very neatly and local co-op is an extremely appreciated feature. Matchmaking is a bit funny to me in the sense where if only four players are available, it will add two AI's instead of allowing for a 2v2 vote. Again, it's not a big deal as empty slots are filled up with AI's (sometimes extremely annoying AI's that score on themselves). This however only applies in non-competitive mode which for the most part is ok. A neat feature is there is an arrow that indicates where the ball is off screen. Additionally, there is a circle marker on the ball to show where and how far up in the air is the ball. Players can press Y to change the camera view off the car and toward the ball. The player can also choose to toggle the lock button for the camera.

Graphics are well done and nothing seems cut short. You can optimize for performance or quality (whoot whoot)! There are different stages in the game but they are limited (or I should say were limited). A few more ""out of this world"" stages have been added for free which is greatly appreciated. The customizations regarding the cars are absolutely well done. From custom paint jobs, custom wheels, to even custom hats (that for some weird reason keep your goal count). My only complaint if I can have one is the DLC purchases for new car skins... but hey, who am I to judge. The menu's and the UI was also well done and everything is kept simple and neat. The music and sounds in game have improved since it's start. I love how different boosts all have a different sound and some even play music. This is really paying attention to detail. The sound tracks in general are pretty catchy. That could be part in fact I've also heard them numerous times.

The game is quite exciting and cars seemingly fly everywhere. It's enjoyable when everyone crashes into the ball, but it is even more delightful when people start calculating hits and play positions.

For future Rocket League DLC's or games, it would be nice to see some mini-games! The main part of the game is excellent, but imagine adding some modifications to it. Perhaps adding power-ups could give an alternative to matchmaking.

Overall good game, and I would recommend it to most people. There are a few friends that are reluctant to get into it, but for the most part it has received positive reception.

***Dec 2016 update : there are new game modes that involve other sports such as hockey or basket ball. I think this is a neat step as it creates many new opportunities. They are not available in competitive mode, but are still very fun to play. You're essentially a flying projectile whenever you wish. When you get the hang of flying, this game's opportunities start flying wide open. Very simplistic game but you can definitely see the skill range of some players is phenomenal. Unlike FIFA where you would get discouraged, I'm sure you'll start challenging yourself when you see some of these crayz stunts.

RATING : 8.1/10

												I bought this game when it was really young, it was around a month after release. At the beginning the game was really difficult to play, but after a while you will master it. You should ONLY play this game if you have some kinda controller, cause with Keyboard and Mouse it is almost impossible to play this game. Think about this for yourself and decide if you want to own this game:

- Like to smash cars? BUY IT!
- Like to fly like never before? BUY IT!
- Like racing and football? BUY IT!


I really recommend it. It's the best game I have ever played so far. Why? Almost every month there is a new DLC or update for the game, so it keeps me really exited! 10/10 IGN."

												Wow, wow, wow. I really wasn't aware of this game before it officially launched. How I could miss such a diamond I do not know. Usually I am not that much into racing games, which isn't really too much of a problem since I wouldn't exactly call it a typical racing game. Still it uses familiar driving mechanics and combines it with the most basic soccer rules. 2 teams of rocket-boosted-cars try to catapult, push, nitro-boost or bump an oversized football into the other teams goal. 

On the ""battlefield"" you find small nodes which add a little to your boost-meter, which is quite limited and you have to carefully time the use of you nitro-boost - if it's time to defend and you find yourself in the other team's half you are not going to get there on time. If the ball is on the way to your opponent's goal you will want to have as much boost as possible to ""kick"" the ball as hard as you can and also to outrace the other players.

You can jump and even double-jump with your car, you can flip and turn in any direction whilst in the air in order to maximize your blocking possibilites and to kick the ball with a spinning move of your car's rear. It's hard to describe but play it for 1 hour and you will get what I mean. :)

Rocket League is crazy, it involves a lot of skill but does not have a particularly steep learning curve. There are only so many moves you can make and the real challenge is to master them all. Matchmaking works like a charm, new games are found quickly and you can decide wether you want to play ranked or just for the fun of it.

I imagine if you play 3v3 together with 2 friends on your team this game gets even greater.

The only things I would wish for in future updates are a little more map variation and some different game modes.

Since there is pretty much only one stadium with several different textures and lighting, things could get a tad repetitive after a while. I can really see the potential of ramps being in there, maybe some minor upgrades/boosts ready for pickup and so on... You could go really crazy expanding the existing formula.

Other than that - I can recommend this without any shadow of a doubt!"

												This game is amazing. In spite of having a high skill ceiling, it is very fun at every skill level. 1v1's are very exciting to measure up individual skills and mind tricks, 2v2s and 3v3s are awesome to team up with your friends (and even randoms), 4v4s are waaay too crazy for my taste but can also be fun.

The newest update included mutators, and they are hilarious to play with friends.

Everything is well done, the gameplay, the graphics, and the mechanics. Even the DLC is well done; they're just cosmetic, they're cool, and they're cheap (Back to the Future DLC).

The developer keeps the game updated with free maps, cosmetic stuff and game modes too.

My only complaint is that it should have a custom training mode, where you can move the ball launcher around, disable goal replay, disable infinite boost, etc...

This will be my favorite game for quite some time for sure."

I left the comfortable region in which a keeper should plant himself firmly.
In the distance I saw my companions on the offensive, rushing back to help me in vain.
It was in that moment that I saw it. I would very soon miss the ball and cause my team great pain.

My thoughts were of all the other games, in those which I’ve made the very same mistake.
Yet the desire to one day succeed was strong and I could not help myself to that leap.
As the ball flew passed me, In that direction that I wished it not to. I felt as if death had gripped me.

I’ve let my comrades down, failed them and taken a selfish action for a benefit that could only be my own. As the ball graciously embraced the deep fathoms of the net, I was met with the taunts and suggestions of my sexuality. I brushed them off, as a knight brush of the lives he takes in the battlefield.

The strange thing is: That I would do it all over again, for one day I will fly through the air like a majestic winged shape, and one day I will hit that ball. My friends will cheer and my enemies will tremble, for thus my rank will be great."

												Rocket League is a physics-based vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in July 2015, with a version for Xbox One and beta versions for OS X and Linux being released in 2016. A physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One began being distributed by 505 Games in June 2016.

This game is really fun, it gives hours of fun with or without your friends, it varies in game modes such as football (soccer) basketball and ice hockey, my personal favourite has got to be soccer, you can spend hours perfecting your touch of the game, by improving ariel strikes, ground striking, goalkeeping, it's endless. It is filled with a great community which can make you a lot of new friends! Once you've gotten better and played a lot at perfecting your touch, you can play more competetive by playing ranked, it's like normal but obviously harder and more competetive. I would definetly recommend this, it has hours of fun, which seems to never end being fun. I would give this a 9/10, it's very fun and I hope to play more."

												Never had so much fun in any game since a long time. 
In the beginning it seemed like a fun game with simple controls but as I've progressed far I've realised it has a lot of depth. 
The feeling  of coordinating with your teammates and playing strategically makes it all the more fun 
All in all its instantly a surprise hit of the year and one of my all-time favourite games.

												Rocket League is pure, perfected and well-balanced fun. Easy to understand but hard to master, If you fail, it'll be your fault, and when you score that super hard shot it'll be immensely gratifying. One of the funniest competitive games I've ever played (and keep playing everyday with no sign of tiredness)."

												IF you've never played Rocket League, like many other good games you're probably going to be dog ♥♥♥♥ when you first start. You'll first join the tutorial and start touching the ball, yea it feels good we know. Then you decide you'll give online a go, REAllY see what this ♥♥♥♥♥ is about. You're first game online you get 2 clears and a center ball, pretty raunchy. You decide to tax yourself on another game and press rematch. You give a great pass to your team mate, wou lose 1-2. You continue to play online even though you have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ you're doing but for some reason you can't stop playing it. Then you start to progress and get better and learn to manipulate the car and the ball in ways you've never seen, and fly(Did I mention you could ♥♥♥♥ing fly). You then start to forget about where you came from and whether or not you even liked the damn game to begin with. You slowly then being training every day before work or school, practicing aerials and dribbling in free play mode. The ball slowly becomes a part of you. You become the rank of ""Pro"" and you're feeling pretty damn hot right now ♥♥♥♥, even scalding. You slowly climb the ranks and descend into the madness that is rocket league. Then the itch starts. You'll be at work or out running errands thinking about how much better time could be spent playing rocket league. When you see a subaru on the road, it's not a subaru to you anymore it's now a Takumi. When you go to bed you dream of Rocket League. Now we go back to the original question of whether or not you would like this game? You'll ♥♥♥♥ing love it, too much. The developers, Psyonix, are incredibly good at listening to what the community wants. Each update they continue to push out more and more content and the game is growing everyday. So many funny options to decorate and customize your cars, from toppers to antennas. You can unlock items in game and craft rarer, more exclusive items from those. You dont have to good at rocket league to like it, you just have to be better at having fun. I have made so many memories off this $20 purchase. Like how the hell are they only charging $20 for this game its incredible. I Have put more time and heart into this game on PC and Xbox then any of the main AAA titles that I used to play, and I probably won't stop. Buy this game. Play this game. Love this game.

I don't normally use an exclamation point after every sentence, but in this case, I WILL!!!

Thank you Angry Joe! So glad I follow all of his episodes at times like this! :D

Original and ridiculously fun. Just the fact that it's original says a lot. Trying to be original these days is basically impossible, but here it is, in all its glory.

Cars + Soccer = I didn't realize I liked soccer till now!

9/10 - RECOMMENDED!

Also, i didn't experience a single fps drop. The game is as smooth as it can be

												I don't like soccer. I don't like cars. I love Rocket League!

Even with no interest whatsoever in the theme, I find Rocket League excellent as a game. Easy to learn, hard to master. It doesn’t start dull, it is fun right from the start as a beginner, and it only gets better as you improve.

It involves a very wide range of skills which gives the gameplay a lot of variety by constantly engaging your different abilities. I don’t mean variety as in different environments or doing different things, rather the variety applies to the ways in which the game demands your participation both physically (mechanical skills, accuracy, timing, consistency, …) and mentally (spatial awareness, intuition for the game’s physics like momentum or bounces, team coordination, …), pretty much like a real sport. This makes it one of the most fulfilling video games to play.

Rocket League is the video game that feels the closest to real life sports. It involves the same kind of skills and provides the same kind of fun. Absolutely recommended to everyone!"

UPDATE: After 1300 hours, I'm starting to feel this game might be just a little addictive. I consider I'm now prepared to stop playing offline with bots and head to the online modes to see what they can offer.
Thanks for all the support, I'll keep you updated."

												Rocket League is an excellent game and one of my favourites. It's very easy to understand but hard to master.

Optimisation is great, and graphics are fantastic. The game also has a full controller support, but you can play with a mouse and keyboard as well, so it's up to you how you want to play. I more prefer the controller.

After the first launch of the game, you will hear a fantastic music on the menu. After that, you can choose your car. Play a tutorial, and finally, you will be ready to play your first multiplayer game.

In the game, there are a lot of cars, and you can also buy paid DLC. Cars from DLCs are technically the same. The only differences are hit boxes. According to developers, all of the cars have the same stats. Vehicles are customisable. For example, you can add an antenna, change your wheels, colour of the car, etc.

Like I wrote above Rocket League is very easy to understand because, in the main mode, the game consists of control the giant ball and try to score. To put it simply, it's just football with cars. You can choose between 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, and 4vs4. The main modes are playable on casual and competitive modes. But there are also game modes which are more advanced like for example ice hockey, basketball and my personal favourite 'RUMBLE'. In 'RUMBLE' rules are the same, but here, every ten seconds the game draws for you one special ability. For example grappling hook, a tornado and a freezer weapon.

As I mentioned above, here are competitive matches. After ten games, you will get your rank. There's  15 ranks: PROSPECT (I, II, III, Elite) CHALLENGER (I, II, III, Elite), RISING STAR, ALL-STAR, SUPERSTAR, CHAMPION, SUPER CHAMPION, GRAND CHAMPION.

The game rewards us in the form of points for all sorts of tricks, like aerials, bicycle hits, etc.


The Verdict
Rocket League is a unique game with simple rules. If you haven't bought this game yet, do it. You won't regret. My final rating is 10/10.



If you found any mistakes, something isn't right, or you just don't like this review. Instead of giving me a thumbs down, tell me what is wrong. Thank you."

												1,500 hours in and the game is even more enjoyable than it was when I began. While it takes time to master specific skills the outcome is worth it, and makes the game continuously fun. The community is so much better than other games, not as toxic, more friendly, more fun, The developers listen to the community and constantly try to improve the game to make it more exciting. It's not pay to win, so anyone can do just as well without spending any extra money. 

It is also optional to play with either keyboard + mouse (like myself for 1,450 hours) or use a controller. While a controller allows for more specific angles, the game is still as fun without it. You can still get a professional level on keyboard + mouse, it is just preference, however for people starting out I would suggest using a controller if it's available as it CAN allow for some better shots.


Overall a  fantastic game, definitely one I'm not giving up on anytime soon."

												edit: I wrote this prior to becoming an employee at Psyonix

Let me start by saying that I have been playing the preview of this game since June 26th, I also was a part of the alpha in 2014 and part of multiple betas.

Simply said, this game is the most fun that may ever exist. You find yourself constantly saying 'Just one more game' over and over and over again because you literally cannot just put it down. It's simple: a car arena like showdown on a soccer field with one giant ball and a bunch of boost to fill your rocket powered dreams, but don't be fooled because this game is much deeper than it will originally look. Psyonix takes a very simlpe core idea and allows us to do whatever we want with it because of its purely physics based gameplay. 

What does this give us though? Let me tell you. Satisfyingly tight controls, action packed multiplayer, awe inspiring aerial goals, sniper tactics, competitive and casual matchmaking, hours of laughing and enjoyment, TONS of explosions (Mr. Torgue aproved), an incredibly balanced game, all future maps will be free, PC to PS4 crossplay, over 150 items for purely cosmetic customizations, and over 10billion of said combinations. 

I can really only say so much about the game itself (partly because English was my worst course :P) but what I really cannot stress enough is that you won't be staying for just the game alone. You'll be seeing Psyonix as one of the only developers left that actually understand what we want as well as falling in love with the community. 

The community of Rocket League (and SARPBC for that matter) is probably the most open, friendly and supportive community I have come accross. Of course this is being said before release and I really hope that you new players please uphold our standard of ingame complements, willingness to help out anyone that wants to learn, and general good sportsmanship. If you find yourself running into a few bad apples, don't worry about it, as you climb up the ladder into the ranks with the rest of the long time players you'll notice the warmer atmosphere to say the least :)

Now I suppose I should say that within the last week I've apparently played nearly 90hrs and that's just playing private matches with the same people constantly. Some would think that I'd be bored after that, but you'd be so so wrong. I can play all day, get into bed and watch some Rocket League videos, and then immediately want to play more (I may or may not be addictive :| but don't think you're immune).

Anyways, I'm going to play some more Rocket League. I hope to see you on the field, and remember... Nice shpt! And never let the ball touch the ground (Rule #1)"

												I watched a lot of people play on Twitch and it looked okay.  Let me tell you this - it is MUCH more fun to play than it is to watch.  Pretty much every gamer needs this game.

9/10 - played for 4 hours straight the first time I played.

No microtransactions
Purely skill based
Unlockable customization

This is how every game should be."

												To start with my review I want to mention that Rocket League is by far the best game I played so far.
I put more than 1500 hours into this game and I don't regret any second of it.


So let me explain why in my opinion this game is just awesome:

First of all, who doesn't like soccer and cars, right? It simply is fascinating not only for adults or children but for everyone.

Secondly, the skill ceiling of this game is higher than the skill ceiling I saw in any other game and actual pro players didn't reach that ceiling yet.

The cars have differences, yes, but they are not that big of a deal and every hitbox/turning radius can be found in all regular cars so premium DLCs don't give you any advantages.

That leads me to my next point: all DLCs are just cosmetic, that means new gamemodes and arenas will be free forever.

The match length of 5 minutes is just perfect for both the eSports scene and for just playing a few matches to have fun, although you might find youself some hours later still playing Rocket League because it is that addictive.

The developers just manage everything perfectly, yet they were/are just a small company:
- Almost every good idea of the community has been implemented in some way, Psyonix works perfectly together with the community.
- Almost one and a half year later the game still gets a ton of free updates/improvements and they care about the game and the community as if it just came out, yet they have made alot of money with Rocket League so they could just settle but they don't.
- A lot of money from the keys for the crates flues directly into the eSports price pools.

There are so many more aspects just as cross-platform gaming that makes the game to the best we have right now in my opinion.

Anyway, it just costs 20 bucks, often it is cheaper on steam sales or on third party sites, so just try it, I bet 99,99% of you won't regret it.

However, thanks Psyonix for this awesome game!
Now I have to get back into Rocket League just to play a few matches which will end in me still sitting here playing in 5 hours...
What a game!"

												Rocket League is next game of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Both game is a physic-based vehicle soccer game. But they improved game a lot since SARPBC.

-This game has a lot of content.(Maps, DLC packs, Ranked play etc.)
-Car costumization really good. You can make however you want your car.
-There is 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 game modes available and you can play this modes as ranked.
-Ranked system changed now. It's much better than number based rank system.
-They're now making competitive tournaments offically.I think they will improve it in the future.
-They're adding several mods but they usually remove them later.
-Game has some optimization issues i think usually show itself at low end pc systems.

I definitely recommend this game. Community growing up and will be bigger in the future."

									Product received for free

												I received Rocket League from a friend who swore by it that it was fun and addicting. 
Following that, I proceeded to play with him and some other friends; but we sucked...bad.

700+ logged hours later....

I am in the top 1% of all players in ranked and am addicted to this game!
--------------------------------------
Rocket league is a game that you can pickup for the first time and be terrible at, but have that feeling that if you fixed a few things, or made a few different moves, you could have done much much better. It is a fast paced game where:
-The idea of the game is simple
-The controls are exceptional! (For real, the cars all react to your controls exactly how you think they should.)
-The skill cap is insanely high
-Every single time the ball goes in the air, you feel like it is possible to make an insane goal off of it

Rocket league is the type of game that I can pickup for a few games and put back down, or I can just delve deep into an 8 hour session and keep trying to rank up and fix my mistakes I had last game.
------------------------------------
Psyonix (The developer) knows how to run this game. They are constantly pushing out new updates, patches, and content; most of which is free!
They allow you to customize your vehicles, so no two are the same. Or you and some friends can team up, create the exact same cars, then be a three man wrecking crew of flying vans!
Psyonix really thought of everything with Rocket league, and they keep adding more and more great content!
------------------------------------
All-in-all, Rocket league is a great game, cannot recommend it enough, and is totally worth even up to a price of $60! 
(Even though I got it for free!)

So have fun in rocket league, work your way to the top, and...
Calculated.
Calculated.
Calculated."

												Excellent game. Not much to say apart from the fact that it's a game that looks great (graphics) and relatively cheap. Each game is on a 5 minute timer so it's a game you can pick up for a few minutes and put down again when you're just killing time.
I've spent a lot of time playing this game in gaming pubs on laptops with friends and that is the perfect atmosphere to play this game. Drink, have a laugh and score some goals.
You can play casually and just enjoy playing, eventually you'll actually get quite good. Or you can play seriously and competitively and run through the tutorials for some extra help. This is the type of game where the more you play, the better you'll become.  As you understand the physics more and get used to the way the ball moves, you'll just know where you have to be in order to score that incredible high goal.

Basically there is no reason not to get this game."

This is my go to game when I got a short time to kill now and I end up playing one more then one more then one more. DLCs are all cosmetic and in no way needed to enjoy the game so get the base game and Have Fun !!"

												Rocket League is a soccer like game, in which you play as a car, can do flips and boost like a rocket. The game is exellent for beginners and pros, showing us that there is a game in which you can't rage.

												This one is a masterpiece, shining like a diamond in my Steam Collection. Soccer with cars? Why not! The learning curve presented here is one of the greatest I've seen in years, both rewarding and satisfying. You can actually feel and see how much better you're becoming after every single hour spent in Rocket League. Developers are pushing updates and fixes every single month, often surprising us with completely new game modes like Rumble and Hoops. Wanna hear more? All updates are free of charge! DLC's are not ""PayToWin"" contest offering small visual enhancements instead.

tl;dr BEST. GAME. EVER.
Buy ASAP"

												Addictive Racecar Football. Surprisingly competitive once you learn a few basic maneuveres, after this you begin to climb the skill tier. Simple yet efficient tiers break up the skill gaps into pools at a decent rate for beginners. As a rookie you will spalsh around with the other casuals and gain a grasp for hitting the ball and maintaining control of the car. Next comes Semi-pro, in this pool you start to get a feel and learn to see where the ball is flying and position yourself accordingly. At Pro you're on your way, this is where the community opens up and stratergies become more meta and kick offs take some priority. Veteran feels like you're being thrown in teh deep end because higher tier Veterans have advanced onto flying with that car and Aerials become the go to plan of attack. Expert is where Crossing is how to beat the defence line having someone in the air to topple enemy teams. There are three higher tiers but im not quite there, being Master > Legend > Rocketeer. Occasionally ther servers are overloaded or lack some players so you get to be the big fish and splash around with lower tier players while the game finds some players more suited. 

Constant DLC is a awesome bonus, and new Mutator gamemodes make for an awesome custom mode with friends.

Overall a decent game, whether you're a PS4 Casual to a Competitive Player it suites all."

												500+ hours and I'm still learning new things about how to hit the ball and coordinate with teammates. Ranked is very intense and a blast. People are generally open to teaming up and I've made a lot of friends on this game already. There's a very real sense of progression with both a cumulative rank and a skill rank. It's absurd, it's thrilling, it's hilarious, it's endlessly challenging, and it's addicting. Pay whatever they ask. Just get the game."

												Rocket League is less of a ""sports game"" and more of an actual sport. In FIFA or Madden you have a ""pass"" button, but to make a pass in Rocket League you have to drive your car into the ball at the right speed and angle to send it over to where your teammate is going. You have to create the pass yourself, and it can be anything, from a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defender. 

Passing, shooting, dribbling, tackles, jukes, they're all in the game, but you  have to make them happen yourself, not just press the right button. At first, just driving car to ball is a challenge, but as your skill grows, the freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything you'll find in a ""sports game"". Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ball, you'll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense. 

There are very few games that are consistently rewarding for hundreds or thousands of hours, that can keep challenging you as you improve, and improve, and improve beyond what you ever imagined you'd be capable of. In fact, this is the ONLY one I know. 

Best.

Game.

Ever."

												~ If you happen to like FIFA series, then this is for you! ~

PROS: 

- Awesome Soundtrack;

- The ability to disable Cross-Platform Multiplayer;

- Great graphics;

- Beyond average K+M experience, though I think it could be played better with a gamepad;

- Buying a 4-Pack during sale it's a smart thing to do!

CONS:

- The inability to disable completely both Cross-Platform Multiplayer and ignore people who play with a gamepad (you don't have an option for the 2nd thing)."

												IF you've never played Rocket League, like many other good games you're probably going to be dog ♥♥♥♥ when you first start. You'll first join the tutorial and start touching the ball, yea it feels good we know. Then you decide you'll give online a go, REAllY see what this ♥♥♥♥♥ is about. You're first game online you get 2 clears and a center ball, pretty raunchy. You decide to tax yourself on another game and press rematch. You give a great pass to your team mate, wou lose 1-2. You continue to play online even though you have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ you're doing but for some reason you can't stop playing it. Then you start to progress and get better and learn to manipulate the car and the ball in ways you've never seen, and fly(Did I mention you could ♥♥♥♥ing fly). You then start to forget about where you came from and whether or not you even liked the damn game to begin with. You slowly then being training every day before work or school, practicing aerials and dribbling in free play mode. The ball slowly becomes a part of you. You become the rank of ""Pro"" and you're feeling pretty damn hot right now ♥♥♥♥, even scalding. You slowly climb the ranks and descend into the madness that is rocket league. Then the itch starts. You'll be at work or out running errands thinking about how much better time could be spent playing rocket league. When you see a subaru on the road, it's not a subaru to you anymore it's now a Takumi. When you go to bed you dream of Rocket League. Now we go back to the original question of whether or not you would like this game? You'll ♥♥♥♥ing love it, too much. The developers, Psyonix, are incredibly good at listening to what the community wants. Each update they continue to push out more and more content and the game is growing everyday. So many funny options to decorate and customize your cars, from toppers to antennas. You can unlock items in game and craft rarer, more exclusive items from those. You dont have to good at rocket league to like it, you just have to be better at having fun. I have made so many memories off this $20 purchase. Like how the hell are they only charging $20 for this game its incredible. I Have put more time and heart into this game on PC and Xbox then any of the main AAA titles that I used to play, and I probably won't stop. Buy this game. Play this game. Love this game.

												The 10 players you meet in Rocket League :
The Defeatist                :
    The match begins and boom! Within thirty seconds a goal is scored and your team is down 0-1. That's when one player on your team decides it's all over. The lead is insurmountable, the tide is irreversible, the team is unsalvageable. The Defeatist immediately abandons the match to continue the restless search for a team that won't let them down the way you just did.

The Spoiler                  :
   You've just made an amazing, epic save. The ball was 90% inside your goal, glowing like a white dwarf and about to explode, but you somehow manage to bop it out just in the nick of time. And there's The Spoiler, the player on the other team just parked there, three feet away, who simply nudges it back in for a goal, utterly erasing your heroics.

The Archivist                :
   Sometimes you want to watch replays, sometimes you don't. Everyone feels that way except for The Archivist, who never, ever chooses to skip the replays even though they're not even featured in them. Even though everyone else has voted to skip it and get back to playing. C'mon, dude! I accidentally scored on my own goal and don't want to relive it. Press skip! Press skip!

The Hitman                   :
   While most players focus on the ball, some focus on the other players. The Hitman doesn't just demolish other cars when the opportunity presents itself but makes it a personal mission to ram, batter, and destroy you from the opening seconds to the final klaxon. Not a bad strategy, really. If you're hit by this player more than once you'll probably give up on the ball and spend the match looking for a little payback.

The Failed Stuntman          :
   We all know the ball spends about half its time rolling up the side of the arena, and those skilled enough can chase it and make plays while vertical. The Failed Stuntman thinks the same thing, but is entirely wrong. They'll constantly chase ball up and down the wall and never once connect. Just wait for it to land, willya? You're not doing any good up there.

The Only Player On Your Team :
   The ball has been centered and you're in the perfect position to knock it in for a score. But what's this? A teammate flies in backwards, knocking it away from you, off the wall, and back into midfield. It's The Only Player On Your Team, and this driver never, ever stops going for the ball, no matter where it is or who else might be going for it at the same time. As far as this driver is concerned, there's only one player on your team, and it's not you.

The Doorman's Ghost          :
   Praise be to the players who don't always try to score but hang back and protect your team's net. Occasionally a driver will actually spend the entire game playing goalie, which is great! Except for The Doorman's Ghost, who waits patiently between your uprights until the other team takes a shot on goal. At which point he's suddenly somewhere else.

The Benedict Arnold          :
   We've all done it, either by an ill-timed boost or an attempted save or just bad luck: we've all scored on our own goal. The proper behavior in this instance is to spend the rest of the match feverishly trying to make up for it, but not so for the Benedict Arnold. After scoring on their team they'll vanish in a puff of shame, too embarrassed to even attempt redemption.

The Drunken Angel            :
   Aerial skills are both important and rare, and most players won't risk it unless they're lined up perfectly or are desperate for a goal. Except for The Drunken Angel, who rockets into the air the second the ball is off the ground despite never once successfully making a play. In fact, even when the ball isn't in the air, this player is. Some drivers just like to fly.

The Holdout                  :
   You've just had a fun, amazing, hard-fought match with fantastic plays, epic saves, and stunning goals that came down to a lengthy and memorable overtime. Everyone agrees immediately that another game is absolutely necessary. Except for The Holdout, who refuses to ready up. But why? We shared something beautiful! We'll never find each other again! Please, ready up! Ready up before it's too—

the Toxic                    :
   The reason we use the word 'toxic' is very intentional.
   In our observations and research on player behavior, we find that a single source of negative              behavior can ripple through hundreds or thousands of games. For example, let's say we have a game with     6 players--5 are positive, and 1 is negative. The 1 negative player is racist, rages all game, and  intentionally leaves the game. This experience can negatively influence some of the other 5 positive players in the game. Some of these 6 players will play another game of Rocket League and instead of being positive, they might start the game neutral or negative. Their actions can then influence 6 other players in the game, and toxicity spreads. 

A single negative action could result in thousands of games with negative incidences--this is why many of our latest experiments focus on shielding players from toxicity (Restricted Chat Mode -- forcing players to make a decision between using limited chat resources for cooperative communication, or still using it for negative purposes and being message capped), or stemming the spread of toxicity (our next experiment)."

												Quick, competitive gameplay with easy to understand mechanics makes rocket league a fun game with high replayability. It is clear to an active player that the developers truly care about the game and constantly release features everyone can enjoy. Even if you pick this game up just to play locally with some friends, it will be worth every penny. Every new patch has new features that are exciting and keep me coming back time and time again. In matches, it's rare to feel cheated out of a game due to RNG. Even if you don't want to play, the simple premise makes watching rocket league quite enjoyable at any skill level. I highly suggest playing this game as much as you possibly can."

The game has a indepth tutorial to get you started off on your all-star career, and the game even offers a season mode which will rank you against other players. The game runs well, and looks as it should. If you're thinking of picking up this game with friends, do it. You will truly love it."

Amazingly fun game to play but even more fun, to me, is watching pros like Dirkend, Law, Tree, Kronovi, Gibbs, and sorry if I missed anyone that streamed beta/preview and actually has shown what are the game's possibilities. With that being said, I think and really hope that this game will become one of next E-sports big things, it certainly would be lots of fun for the audience. 

I'll give it 10/10 for the game, rate a lot lower for community because people that are leaving games a lot, but hopefully that will get changed.

												Wow, wow, wow. I really wasn't aware of this game before it officially launched. How I could miss such a diamond I do not know. Usually I am not that much into racing games, which isn't really too much of a problem since I wouldn't exactly call it a typical racing game. Still it uses familiar driving mechanics and combines it with the most basic soccer rules. 2 teams of rocket-boosted-cars try to catapult, push, nitro-boost or bump an oversized football into the other teams goal. 

On the ""battlefield"" you find small nodes which add a little to your boost-meter, which is quite limited and you have to carefully time the use of you nitro-boost - if it's time to defend and you find yourself in the other team's half you are not going to get there on time. If the ball is on the way to your opponent's goal you will want to have as much boost as possible to ""kick"" the ball as hard as you can and also to outrace the other players.

You can jump and even double-jump with your car, you can flip and turn in any direction whilst in the air in order to maximize your blocking possibilites and to kick the ball with a spinning move of your car's rear. It's hard to describe but play it for 1 hour and you will get what I mean. :)

Rocket League is crazy, it involves a lot of skill but does not have a particularly steep learning curve. There are only so many moves you can make and the real challenge is to master them all. Matchmaking works like a charm, new games are found quickly and you can decide wether you want to play ranked or just for the fun of it.

I imagine if you play 3v3 together with 2 friends on your team this game gets even greater.

The only things I would wish for in future updates are a little more map variation and some different game modes.

Since there is pretty much only one stadium with several different textures and lighting, things could get a tad repetitive after a while. I can really see the potential of ramps being in there, maybe some minor upgrades/boosts ready for pickup and so on... You could go really crazy expanding the existing formula.

Other than that - I can recommend this without any shadow of a doubt!"

												Rocket League is one of my favorite games.  Why?


The game's system is the best that i can imagine. Your advantage over other players isn't measured by how many hours you have, how many dlcs you got, or your level. It's measured by how much you've learned and perfected.

You start as a derp car that can't hit a ball 20ft above the ground. Then you keep playing against people of the same skill, until you see someone who can do some cool/pro/funky/op stuff, then you see his goals and you think: ""Wow, look at that shot, i must learn how to do it!""        
      Then in a matter of time, you learn how to do it and even do better. One step closer to become a Rocketeer.                  
                                                       some more training and you can hit the ball wherever it is.
                                                    even more and you can aim the ball wherever you want.

The controls are great, comfortable and very easy to learn. If you use a controller, you will not have an advantage against who uses a keyboard and vice-versa.

The graphics are nice, you can play it with a microwave using low graphics, or a medium computer on max graphics with a solid 60 fps. They could be better though (?)

The levels normally represent your skill very well if you aren't a lot above-average or below-average, with a Rookie playing like a rookie and a legend playing like a legend. (The level ""Pro"" is just wrong, you probably aren't pro yet if you are there)

The matchmaker does its job well. Rather than your level, it takes your ""skill"" in consideration, so you will often play with people only slightly better or worse than you. This isn't bad, it is actually very good for you to learn and get better.

Can i say anything more?
NO item in the game gives you advantage over other player, all cars have the same speed and the only thing that changes is the hitbox, not a big deal when you learn the controls. The DLCs don't make you better or anything, too."

												Day 1 - ""Wow! This game is fun!""
Day 25 - ""Wow! Those pro players are amazing!""
Day 91 - ""I must get better.""
Day 180 - ""I've played every day since I bought this game. Send help.""

Day 384 - ""This game literally inhabits my dreams.  Carball is all I know.  ""


 In all seriousness... 
This game is ridiculously fun. Unlike a sports simulation where you simply press a button to pass or shoot, you're given total control over a Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Car. You physically ram your vehicle into the ball to dribble, pass, and shoot. The concept is ludicrous and results in one of the best games I've personally ever played.

At low levels, the game is slow paced as people become accustomed to the mechanics, but never does it cease to harbor massive levels of enjoyment. As the game opens up (from your skill and grasp of the controls), you'll start to see the game in a totally different way. Everywhere on (and above) the field is now open to play, and you can start creating teamplay opportunities you never thought possible. The game progressives like such throughout your time playing, and the skill ceiling is incredibly high (if not non-existant). I'll spare you my ranting, but regardless of winning, losing, or who I was playing with or against, it has always been a good time. 

On a different note, the game is almost nearly as amazing to watch as it is to play. The ""Rocket League Championship Series""[twitch.tv] is the official Psyonix/Twitch partnered eSports event. Alongside the pro's, there is competition at nearly every level. The community is bright and active, and the devs are some of the most interactive and supportive creators I have ever seen in the game industry. Please take a chance, grab some friends, and give this game a try. It will be fun. And once you're hooked, be sure to come hang out on the subreddit or check out the dedicated fan site (http://rocket-league.com) to learn more about the community and rapidly growing eSports scene."

												Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam group
Few words about the game

Recently bought this game with few of my friends and we became addicted to it. You will have really nice time playing it, with your friends or without them as people are quite nice in matchmaking. Good and simple action packed game. Movement is quite simple but really takes alot of time to perfectly master it. This game have everything you need to relieve from CS:GO rage.

Advantages
 - Game handles very well, doesn't matter if you play on keyboard or controller
 - Matchmaking is good and quick
 - AMAZING soundtrack
 - Suprisingly good graphics
 - Takes time to master ""movement"" what makes you want to play more to be better at itDisadvantages
 - Playing against bots is pointless, you could aswell take an empty court
 - From time to time there are little troubles with connection
 - Really, like... REALLY addictive

												I can't even begin to give this game enough praise. Why?

I start playing this game with the intent to only play an hour, and realize many hours later how long I've actually been playing. Whether I'm experiencing a bitter defeat, a glorious victory, or a five minute overtime bout I'm still having a blast. I yell, I shout, I pump my fist in hoorah for that aerial save I just made. And I still can't get enough of this game.

Rocket League is a very well polished sportsy footballesque game where you drive cars and try to shoot the ball into the opposing teams goal. It's a simple concept but with all the moves and tricks your cars can perform there is suprising depth in how to play as an indvidual and as a team. You can perform all types of moves, you can do just about any type of roll or flip perceivable, single jumps, double jumps, and you can even fly with your boost. This is one of the few games that I've had this level of drive to master my play, and with two whole days of game time logged away I feel like I've really just mastered the basics and am just now scratching the surface on higher level play.

I'm often a bit hestitant to jump into online games, especially ranked. I find ranked matches in general to be stressful and a little too adrenaline intensive, yet in Rocket League I've had nothing but a blast playing competitively even when I was as green as the turf I was driving on. I've never even hesitated to try new things in competitive games or to try and master aerial shots and other such techniques that are easy to screw up. In short, I've had a lot of fun playing this game and the drive to better my play has been a contributing factor to my enjoyment. Playing with a friend makes the game all the more enjoyable, being able to shout at each other over VOIP about each amazing shot we convert or each epic save we make makes an already exciting game all the more awesome.

Bottom line. This game is FUN. It's just fun. You jump in, you find a match, you play, and you have fun. It's not overly complex, it doesn't add lots of un-needed features. It's straight up action packed fun.

P.S. And of course, like any good driving game, you can customize your ride so you can kick butt in style."

												Edited as of: 21st July 2015 01:00

Pros:
+ Its a football/soccer game that contains rocket powered cars (added soccer because of americans).
+ It is purely a skill based game and everything the player does matters.
+ (in my experience) my game seems to run at a stable 60FPS after turning off the frame limiter.
+ Graphics looking quite nice.
+ PC, PS4 cross play is possible.
+ Its easy to learn, Impossible to master.
+ Ranking system currently works well with score gained or lost each match.
+ There are a lot of friendly players in the steam community.
+ Save replays after matches and edit them to your hearts content in the editor
+ Full xbox 360/xbox one controller support

Cons:
- PS4, PC cross parties are currently non-existant
- You can unlock a lot of things in such a small time, I'm level 20/30 and I have 100% of the items
- Some people have crashing issues (mainly NVIDIA DRIVER ISSUES, I run AMD so I do not have these issues myself)
- Lower ranks may take a large time for even skilled players to get out of due to solo 3v3 treating everyone the same
- You cannot communicate to PS4 players except for a small amount of pre-determined chat commands
- Voice codec is rather terrible, so advice is to use out of game communication

Middle:
= Servers are pretty much sorted now, the occasional lag spike will happen at peak times though
= Currently no spectator system
= NO PEER TO PEER, so even private matches require servers to be up
= 4v4 is the limit, (some people see that as good, some as bad)
= Any controller other than xbox may require some outside support or some other sort of executable

That is as fair as I can be to it, if I missed anything out, tell me.

TL:DR, I think its a good game from my experience :D

GET THE GAME HERE

												I have to admit I kind of scoffed at the concept of a soccer game with cars, but rocket cars? The rockets add a layer of grace and skill that is hard to describe and is best experienced live. There are literally hundreds of Wow! and OMG! moments to be had. Rocket League has turned into one of my favorite multiplayer games, and I don't even like soccer!

The game has a large, but linear learning curve as you progress to the higher ranks. Start off learning the fundamentals like basic offense, defense, and blocking shots. Then as you get better, you improve dribbling skills, centering techniques, team positioning, plus hard and soft shots. As you advance further, you become proficient at wall shots, aerials, epic saves, and bad shot recovery. I have played nearly 200 hours and I still feel like I'm learning and improving my game.

I find the game intensely addicting with its 5 minute matches. Once one game is over, I'm ready to start another and it's almost impossible to just play a single game. As my skills improve, it fuels my incentive to keep playing more.

They recently added a hockey modification which is amazingly good as well. I'd venture to say I like it even better than the original game.

I can't praise Rocket League enough. It has the right mixture of speed, adrenaline, and fun."

Cars playing soccer, it's self-explanatory.

Why fast?
After you have played ""just 5 matches"" during night, you see the sun rises in your window.

Why addictive?

												Fast-paced game where cars play football carball. A great concept backed up by its great gameplay!

Everything on this game is just spot on; The steering, the map sizes, the game lenghts, where the boosts are placed at...
This game has also alot content to unlock. There are no real advantanges what car you are using, except some cars have a bit tinier or larger hit box. I honestly like this, because I can use the car for the looks and not for the advantage.

No matter if you play mostly FPS games, MOBA, mmorpg etc. this game will be perfect for you. I can honestly recommend this game for EVERYONE. I am pretty sure that I will spend hundreds of hours on this game.

												This game is absolutely incredible! I have never played a single game in my life that has managed to captivate me as much as Rocket League. The premise of the game is simple and easy to pick up but difficult to master; just what I look for in a game.

Definitely worth buying. You will have hours of fun and you'll keep telling yourself: 'Just five more minutes...'

												 TL;DR in the end of the review!
I never had this much fun slamming balls into a big goal in front of me... this is Pu$$...

Oh wait... wrong review...

Erhm, rhm... Rocket League. Okay, what to say about it? 

Well, for one, it's the pure definition of a competitive video game: it's easy to learn and takes a lifetime to master.
I need, however to adress one thing that will put MANY people off: and that is the mix of genres it seems to have, and that is its mix of football and driving...

However:

 I have no hesitation in recommending this game at all, including for people that do not like racing, football or both, simply because it doesn't belong to any of such genres and as such, the problems you have with those genres/games, you simply won't have here.:

- The slow paced gameplay of football, filled with tactics, rules, free kicks, offsides, penalties, yellow and red cards, etc. etc. is COMPLETELY GONE! You can use ur nitro and completely obliterate the opposite team without any repercussions. The only thing football related here is that there's a ball (which is a bomb) and you need to put it in the opponent's goal (which will trigger the ball to explode).

- And the same applies to the racing component: there are no pre-determined paths, no speed limits, no linearity, crashing won't penalize you all that much and the vertical limitations are gone as you can fly, jump, wall jump and basically do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want (which I will mention a bit further below in this review)!

To put it in a more adequate analogy... I guess I can call it the Quake of sports games  as it clearly takes ideas from the Arena FPS genre, which is where Psyonix (the devs) got a name with their big hit Unreal Tournament 2004 (alongside Epic and DE). 

It allows a very engaging mix of football and cars. The devs could make a very plain car football game and that would be it. But they didn't do just that, did they?

Well, ♥♥♥♥ NO! You can jump, double jump, dash forward, to the sides or even dash backwards, do bycicle kicks, drive on the walls, jump from those walls and fly across the whole map, boost around and so much else! 

It will take you dozens of hours to master each technique properly and it helps that there is  ZERO RNG or stat based gameplay in the game!!: the cars all perform the same  except in 2 clear aspects: hitboxes (The big Van-like car has a much shorter but taller hitbox than the Dominus muscle car) and drifts/handbrake use. I am using my XBOX360 controller ( which I recommend, though keyboard is VERY intuitive as well ) with customized controls to my liking, where B is the handbrake. With, for example, the Takumi or the Breakout, you can do 180's MUCH more easily than with the Van-like car (I don't know the name of the Van, because I actually don't use it at all :p).

GRAPHICS
The graphics are absolutely excellent! Grass looks quite impressive, the bloom and shaders are stunning and give the game a very well needed sense of ""immersion"" that you are in an actual stadium!
The game can run on pretty much any PC (granted, you may need to tweak it a bit on weaker PC's, of course) but when maxed out, it's a joy to both look at and play. There's AN FOV SLIDER!!!!! And many more camera options, graphics options are immense as well and can help you tweak the game to your liking (♥♥♥♥ motion blur).

AUDIO
Audio consist of 2 big elements: Menu soundtrack and In-Game effects.

The soundtrack in this game is absolutely awesome! Easily one of the best I've heard the past decade. It makes you hum and bobble your head around with the cool pop tunes.

Sound effects are good, but good only. The car engines sound quite ""meh"", but the ball exploding, the sounds the stadium produce when a goal is scored (which are, btw, all different: Every stadium has it's own sound props, which is a very welcome attention to detail) are all very well done. There are lots of different boost trace skins (which I'll adress later) and each make their own sounds, which is, AGAIN, a very nice and welcome attention to detail.

GAMEPLAYBesides all the cool moves I listed above I must say the physics in this game are the best I've seen in, probably, ever! I am not even kidding...

The game has the same mode (just score the most goals after 5 mins) but there are 4 playlists: 1v1 Duel, 2v2 Duos, 3v3 Standard and the 4v4 Chaos mode (and I can confirm it's chaotic as f*ck!).

While there are no different modes... I can say that every playlist has it's own skill to be met. 1v1 requires a more balanced attack and defensive mindset,  2v2 is pure teamwork, 3v3 is a bit more chaotic  and there is space for a full 100% striker and a full-time 100% goalkeeper as well (even though it's not recommended: everyone needs to have a more mixed role, though a more attacking player and a more defensive player ARE CRUCIAL!) and 4v4 takes skill but I play it (as most probably do as well) just for the fun :D

EXTRAS / CONTENT IN GENERAL
There is a spectator mode and an offline season mode, the latter is barebones at best and serves no purpose, only to practise against bots and collect some achievements.

There are 150 customization items for your cars, if I'm not mistaken. These involve Hats, Antennas, Boost trace skins (like a basic nitrous skin, a flamethrower skin, purple smoke, blue data-streams, rainbows (my favorite :D), etc. etc.), paint jobs, materials for the car (you can have cars made of carbon fiber, gloss, metal, etc., very GRID 2-esque, which I really like), overall:

It's nearly impossible to find a player with the exact same car as you.

You can save replays of your game to watch them later or brag to your friends about that amazing long shot or impossible save you managed to pull off successfully.

There a tutorial system that is VERY HELPFUL to noobs but later grows into ridiculously difficult saves and shots that are there to make you see how well you have mastered the game's mechanics (timing is very crucial in any save/shot you take and most of all... power of antecipation... kinda like the Quake multiplayer... eh... see why I called it the Quake of sports now? Well there you go...). 

There is a ranked mode and leaderboards. There is also an unbelievable amount of stats, like ""How many goals did you score with this hat?"", ""How many kilometers with this set of wheels?"" or ""How many saves did you do with this paintjob?"", which add alot to a very entertaining package that takes dozens, if not hundreds of hours for you to get bored with.

Oh and there's crossplatform play with PS4 players (which from my experience, most tend to suck).

TL;DR and CONS
Alright, let's re-arrange it all with a basic PROS (+) / CONS (-) system since you lazy ""I hate reading"" ♥♥♥♥s love it so much :)

+ Great and enourmous ammounts of customization;
+ Takes lots of skill to be good at it;
+ Beautifu Graphics;
+ Phenomenal Soundtrack
+ Formidable Physics
+ Huge amounts of replayability
+ Crossplatform play with PS4
+ Some lucky shots, saves and nail-biting close matches will be some of funniest and most satisfying moments in your gaming life, respectively;
+ Formidable sense of growth with every match. You don't gain anything, no guns and none of that ♥♥♥♥. But you gain the most important thing that 95% of today's modern games don't offer: YOU GAIN SKILL! (Shocker, I know, most of you probably haven't heard of this word at all :p)
+ Adequate even for non-football and non-racing fans as it has nearly nothing in common with those genres.

- Server issues at launch (now fixed)
- Barebones and pointless single player season mode (MP season mode would be cool, though)

Overall, I recommend this game to literally everyone that enjoys video games."

												Not much explanation needed. Soccer with cars.... they even got hockey and basketball. I love this game.
My only complaint is that the servers could be a lot better, this is one of the only games that I have network problems with (lagging, teleporting, driving in a straight line and getting pushed side to side etc.). Some servers perform fine others are just garbage. 
I strongly recommend using a controller for this game."

												Such a great game. I'm not a fan of sports or that much into racing games, but damn this won me over. If this was a sport, I'd be in the pub watching it.

This game is seriously the kind of game that you can jump in whenever you want, and have a blast. What's even more amazing is how well the online play works in combination with local multiplayer. Me and a friend gaming on the couch in vertical split screen against people online. Not many developers these days cater to PC gamers the way they cater to console gamers, but Psyonix did just that. There's also a huge online community thanks to cross platform play with PS4.

I've owned the game for two days and have put in over 20 hours already. I am having a blast."

												~ If you happen to like FIFA series, then this is for you! ~

PROS: 

- Awesome Soundtrack;

- The ability to disable Cross-Platform Multiplayer;

- Great graphics;

- Beyond average K+M experience, though I think it could be played better with a gamepad;

- Buying a 4-Pack during sale it's a smart thing to do!

CONS:

- The inability to disable completely both Cross-Platform Multiplayer and ignore people who play with a gamepad (you don't have an option for the 2nd thing)."

If you don't have A life PLAY IT.

1.7k hours in the game atm, it's A hard game to learn but worth it in the end, feelsgoodman when you can freestyle, hit crazy shots, play against pro's.

It's A game where you NEED to put alot of hours into before you get anywhere, people get salty fairly easily."

												Rocket League is one of my most recommended games for steam users as it is is just a necessity. It is one of those games that must be part of any collection even with it being relatively new still, and has amazing replayability. 
Even with around 250 hours in game, I still feel experienced enough to say that with a mixture of gameplay styles and techniques to try such as aerials; it makes the game much more fun than it appears at first view. It's not just a demolition derby football game, it has a diverse set of mechanics which makes it differ from any other game and unique in it's own way. 
It does help to play with friends, but playing by yourself is also just as good. Playing with friends means funny muck ups and great goals are even better as you get to share them with people who are enjoying the game as much as you, and makes for great experiences, but by yourself is just as good sometimes.
The concept behind the game is so simple yet can be difficult to master when compared with footage with really good players who harness their car's ability to move in different ways for the advantage, but then that is just more reason to play the game to become better and learn how to score goals in different ways."

												To start with my review I want to mention that Rocket League is by far the best game I played so far.
I put more than 1500 hours into this game and I don't regret any second of it.


So let me explain why in my opinion this game is just awesome:

First of all, who doesn't like soccer and cars, right? It simply is fascinating not only for adults or children but for everyone.

Secondly, the skill ceiling of this game is higher than the skill ceiling I saw in any other game and actual pro players didn't reach that ceiling yet.

The cars have differences, yes, but they are not that big of a deal and every hitbox/turning radius can be found in all regular cars so premium DLCs don't give you any advantages.

That leads me to my next point: all DLCs are just cosmetic, that means new gamemodes and arenas will be free forever.

The match length of 5 minutes is just perfect for both the eSports scene and for just playing a few matches to have fun, although you might find youself some hours later still playing Rocket League because it is that addictive.

The developers just manage everything perfectly, yet they were/are just a small company:
- Almost every good idea of the community has been implemented in some way, Psyonix works perfectly together with the community.
- Almost one and a half year later the game still gets a ton of free updates/improvements and they care about the game and the community as if it just came out, yet they have made alot of money with Rocket League so they could just settle but they don't.
- A lot of money from the keys for the crates flues directly into the eSports price pools.

There are so many more aspects just as cross-platform gaming that makes the game to the best we have right now in my opinion.

Anyway, it just costs 20 bucks, often it is cheaper on steam sales or on third party sites, so just try it, I bet 99,99% of you won't regret it.

However, thanks Psyonix for this awesome game!
Now I have to get back into Rocket League just to play a few matches which will end in me still sitting here playing in 5 hours...
What a game!"

												Let me get right to it. Rocket League is an amazingly addictive game with a lot of depth. Just when you thought you know how to play, other higher-level players will come and shatter that illusion. It also feels amazing seeing players pull off amazing moves, and then after several matches you try looking badass, failing each time, until it does work, and you get progressively better at it. It's a textbook ""easy to learn, hard to master"" kinda game in that regard. The controls are responsive, and it also looks amazing visually at max settings. But... why a negative review then? Hear me out, don't down-thumb like a sheep because I don't ""like it"". Because I do. I love Rocket League, my play time is proof of that. 

Then what is it? On the surface it's very simple, but deep beneath it's a very troubling issue: Psyonix has announced a crate system á la Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2. And as far as I'm concerned it's literally the worst timing to implement such a controversial system, with the recent outcry regarding the CSGOLotto-gate and the two little sh*ts Martin and Syndicate, as well as Valve's involvement in all this (going as far as ""advising and consulting"" these shady websites). Psyonix was - and to a certain extent still is - a developer that I hold highly because of their pro-consumer attitude with a lot of effort put into free post-launch content. To keep affording their contributions, they already sold DLC with new cars and other cosmetic items, but I didn't mind. Why didn't I mind? Because you already knew what you'd buy, it's not a surprise. You can spend the 2$ on a DLC pack and know exactly what you'll get. 

But with this new upcoming system, it's literally going to be a lottery. And I know what you're thinking, ""lol he uses the word literally wrong"". No, I mean it. It's literally a lottery. To make matters worse, while regular gambling is regulated at a minimum age of 18, even children can play Rocket League. Crates will be dropped ""free"" randomly during regular gameplay, but you can only open that crate if you buy a key. Which essentially means it's literally gambling: you never know what's in a crate unless you spend the money on a key to open it. Maybe it's a great and rare item, maybe it's a duplicate you already have dozens of. And to top it all off, you won't even be able to sell your items on the Steam Community Market. ""We don't want it to make prone to exploitations"", they say. But that's bullcrap, it's only because of the console versions that they won't - or can't - implement a selling system. So what happens when you've spent money on this lottery only to have many duplicates? Who knows, probably you could just use the current trading menu with five items of a certain class that convert to one item of a higher class.

This is not just about you. This is also not just about disabling the crate system and just playing the game as we used to. This is about a morally grey system that can take advantage of vulnerable people for uncreative, greedy financial benefit. And I don't want to take part in this, and neither should you. But I expect thumbs down and ignorant comments."

												So I feel like I've played enough of this game now to write a review...


The good.The gameplay: While simple, is very fun. It's soccer, with cars, but the cars have boosters, and can fly :). It's great and engaging, it challenges you to learn new techniques to stay ahead of your opponents. The feeling when you hit that first aerial goal is amazing..trust me ;).
Graphics and performance: The graphics aren't anything to write home about, but this is a good thing in this case. This game runs beautifully on most systems, low or high end alike. I have seen a system with 2gb of ram and a dual core cpu with a gtx 440 gpu run this game on medium settings at 40fps. On my medium spec system it runs at 80-100fps on max settings.
Longevity: As mentioned before, this game challenges you to learn new things and experiment to grow in skill. I always feel like I am getting better, and not just stagnating in skill.
DLC: Best cars in the game are free! DLC just for cosmetic purposes!
There are of course, other good elements to this game, those however are the main points in my opinion. I'd rather alert you to the potential difficulties in the remainder of this review.The bad.Matchmaking: The matchmaking does a decent job of pairing you with good opponents. BUT! If two players of unequal skill levels are playing together in a party, it will find a match to the skill level of the better player. This makes it unpleasent for the lower tier player. Ping is NOT at all accounted into the matchmaking. I live in an area far from the server locations, I am used to getting 200+ ping. Anything under 250 ping is playable. Sometimes however I can enter a ranked match with ping in excess of 600, this is not playable, and is basically a garunteed derank. This won't be a problem for most people, but for those of us living in the dark parts of the world, beware! Not the smoothest experience.
Community: While not nearly as bad as the CSGO community, it has it's fair share of trollers and salty kids. This should be a given with a large multiplayer game, but it's liable to get worse as the game grows, so take note!Verdict
Is Rocket League a good game? ... Yes.
Is it fun? ... Yes, especially with friends.
Is it worth the price? ... Yes, definitely, but if you struggle financially, wait for a sale, as is the case with all games.
Should YOU buy it? ... If you like the idea and want to try it out, yes. If you don't like racing or soccer, you may still love it (as is the case with myself), if you want a serious racing or soccer game though, look elsewhere.

HIGHLY RECCOMENDED"

												You never know how much fun a game can be until you actually try it.  Yeah, you hear all the glowing reviews, but sometimes you need to experience it for yourself.  So I bought the game, on sale for $11.20 (USD), and was able to quickly find a friend to play with.  

The first thing I did was try the tutorial, which impressed me on how tight and responsive the conrols are.  That was a really good sign for a sport where control is necessary.  Next we jumped into an match with easy bots and I scored a goal in the first 4 seconds.  OK, I was not expecting that to feel so satisfying.  That was the exact point that the hook was set.  

It is not easy to score goals.  You wait back at midfield for the right time to speed burst towards a centered pass only to see it go wide or deflect off another player.  You circle back and try to attack again and again.  Time goes by, and then you find yourself colliding with a teammate and happen to bump into the ball that trickles just fast enough to cross the goal line before the opponent can fly over to stop it.  The feeling of triumph floods over you and you cannot stop your grin from growing over your face. 

I am not even 2 hours in at this point and I already see the promise this game holds.  The potential for great fun with friends is there, and that's the key.  I find myself looking forward to my next match.  I can't wait to get out there and drive around like a crazed lunatic and smash some buddies into the wall."

I have been playing Rocket league with a bunch of friends and we have been playing the 4v4 mode, I cannot express how much fun it is, always puts us in a cheerful mood, even if we score a own goal, laughter galore!

												Such a great game. I'm not a fan of sports or that much into racing games, but damn this won me over. If this was a sport, I'd be in the pub watching it.

This game is seriously the kind of game that you can jump in whenever you want, and have a blast. What's even more amazing is how well the online play works in combination with local multiplayer. Me and a friend gaming on the couch in vertical split screen against people online. Not many developers these days cater to PC gamers the way they cater to console gamers, but Psyonix did just that. There's also a huge online community thanks to cross platform play with PS4.

I've owned the game for two days and have put in over 20 hours already. I am having a blast."

I played it since it was in alpha, loved it from the first match.
With time all my friends bought it, even the ones that didn't like car/racing games or football.
We got countless hours of pure fun out of it. You can play for 10 minutes or 5 hours and still have lots of fun. 
It's easy to pick up and play, but hard to master.
It's cheap, a potato could run it and one of the best coop/competitive games out there.

												I have to admit I kind of scoffed at the concept of a soccer game with cars, but rocket cars? The rockets add a layer of grace and skill that is hard to describe and is best experienced live. There are literally hundreds of Wow! and OMG! moments to be had. Rocket League has turned into one of my favorite multiplayer games, and I don't even like soccer!

The game has a large, but linear learning curve as you progress to the higher ranks. Start off learning the fundamentals like basic offense, defense, and blocking shots. Then as you get better, you improve dribbling skills, centering techniques, team positioning, plus hard and soft shots. As you advance further, you become proficient at wall shots, aerials, epic saves, and bad shot recovery. I have played nearly 200 hours and I still feel like I'm learning and improving my game.

I find the game intensely addicting with its 5 minute matches. Once one game is over, I'm ready to start another and it's almost impossible to just play a single game. As my skills improve, it fuels my incentive to keep playing more.

They recently added a hockey modification which is amazingly good as well. I'd venture to say I like it even better than the original game.

I can't praise Rocket League enough. It has the right mixture of speed, adrenaline, and fun."

												Rocket League > League of Legends
Rocket League is the best League

A stranger once said to me, in response to the above statement:

""oh yeah, thats why in twitch you can see more than 200k viewers on lol and 50k on rocket""

To him, or any other who has similar remarks, I proclaim the following words:

""Greatness is not measured in viewer counts or player amounts.

Greatness, my friends, is measured in leagues""

Truth be told, there is no game that can compare to the glorious, magnificent experience that is Rocket League. 

This masterpiece is truly in a league of its own.

Furthermore, before any of you cast forth accusations upon me, I can assure you, I am not in league with those who developed this supreme, rocket-powered work of exquisitely coordinated, flashing pixels.

-----------------

Ok you know what? forget the formalities and proper grammar. Imma shoot straight with you. 

If you thought you could just buy the game and top the leaderboards in a day, you. thought. wrong.

The journey's gonna be harder than that trek from a toilet-paperless dump to that stack of extra rolls in your basement in the middle of the night with the lights out.

Most of the ppl you meet will be way out of your league, and its gonna take guts, practice, and a controller if you want to make it anywhere. 


So Stand Tall. Stand Proud.

So Sit Down. On Your Butt.

Idle In That Menu.

Listen To That Soundtrack.

Join That Game.

And Get Rekt Make That Ball Go Boom."

As an American, the only way a game of footy is entertaining to me is if it's played a few middle aged fat blokes in Toyota Yarises. Thankfully, there is someone out there who is a whiz programmer that  has put together a game that entertains people like me and I am sure a few ""football"" fans as well. Rocket League is built upon simple mechanics that are easy to pick up but difficult to master. Jumps, boosts and wallrides can be strung together into insane acrobatics that foist the ball into the net. You can customize the aesthetics of your ride by putting in time and unlocking goodies and competative online play make this a title you will come back to over and over. It's insane to think it has taken so long for a satifying vehicle based soccer game to pop up here on steam."

												""It's like football with cars"" - IGN

Pros:
Football (if you're a fan of that)
Cars
Great mechanics
Great physics
Bots are on par with players (from what I've experienced)
Great visuals
Suitable for both casual and veteran gamers alike
Being updated a lot and updates include a lot of cool stuff
Cons:
I can't think of any cons at the moment
This game is a perfect example of a football game done right, and in general, a perfect example of a game done right. It's so hard to find anything bad about Rocket League. This tops pretty much every football game ever released, even FIFA. Final verdict is an A++."

												I decided to give this game a try last night.

5 hours later, I was telling myself ""just.... 1.... more.... game....""

Needless to say, I'm hooked. It's great fun when you're on a roll, but when you go up against a team of semi-pros, it can be both frustrating and depressing. But I suppose that can go for any competitive game."

												I bought this without expecting that much, but it caught me, and suddenly i played for almost 5 hours and it was almost morning. This game is very fun and addicting. It isn't hard to learn, but takes time to truly master.

Also, i didn't experience a single fps drop. The game is as smooth as it can be

												Rocket League;

In this little gem of a game you're in control of a car...these cars have rocket boosters on the back of them. Your goal is to play soccer/football. You can do 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or even 4v4. There is also a ranking system if you're the competitive type. The matches are usually quick which makes it really easy to get addicted to this game meaning you'll be hitting play again over and over. The average match length is 5-7 minutes. (Could be longer if you go into overtime) In those few minutes you and your teammates need to try to score as many goals as you possibly can while trying to keep the other team from scoring. Another great thing about this game is that the cars that you use to play are customizable. You unlock flags, hats, wheels, body styles, paint and all sorts of other things to make your car the way you want. There is ALWAYS people playing so you definitely don't have to worry about not having people to play with. It is cross-platform which means you're also up against people on PS4. Honestly I would recommend playing with an Xbox controller if you have one (its easier for me personally) Most of the time on average there's about 50-60,000 people online at any given time.

Since the first time I wrote this review there has been a few DLC added to Steam for purchase for this game. They're definitely worth it, along with Rocket League itself. Make sure to pick up this game for you and your friends, you won't regret it.

Pros:
-Quick Games
-Amazing Graphics (Your potato can run it at max settings)
-Customization
-Steep Learning Curve

Cons:
-You'll Be Playing With Balls....Tons and Tons of Balls. ;)
-Keyboard Controls Take a While to Get Used to

Final Verdict;

10/10"

Physics are prefect
Variety of different stadiums.
Graphics are colourful and vibrant and in 1080p 
Visual settings include : Anti Aliasing. MSAA, AO, depth, bloom, lights/lens, shadows and blur

Over 10 billion possible combinations 
100% chance of reward when you finish a match

												Hey guys, it's Super Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars...2? Or I guess Rocket League?

Rocket League is one of those ideas you're surprised has not been done yet. But it's totally been done before. What Rocket League does is refine, simplify, and intensify.

Pros:Stellar and easy-to-grasp controls that invoke ""Easy to learn but hard to master""
Stellar visuals and optimization on PC. The grass looks magnificant!
A good variety of cosmetics to use.
Absolutely god damn fun. Matches are energetic, intense, filled with determination, and sometimes insane errors.
A neato soundtrack. Personal favorites are Whiplash and Fireworks.
Nitpicks:The game does not have a lot of unique modes beyond it's simple Soccer mode, with several varients like Snow Day.
Cons:The ranking system (As of Season 1) is absolutely broken. Those who have fallen far behind the ladder have absolutely zero chance to rank up. As of Season 2, the ranking system will be swapped to something like CS:GO, so this will definitely fix these problems.
As with any multiplayer game, it's supplement AI are not the best to play with, making modes like Season not so enjoyable to play. Thankfully, most online matches normally don't involve them, so they don't affect the game in a similar fashion that bots do in CS.
The Review
Rocket League is the result of a well-refined concept that's made it's debut back in 2008 as Super-Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars. While SARPBC had a whole lot more modes, maps and content, Rocket League is a lot more light in content, but that's because that was something the devs didn't focus on. Instead, Rocket League is a much more refined and focused game.

The game plays and feels amazing, and this is because of what's changed since then. The cars have weight to them, which gives the player the feeling that they have much more control.

It's team-based play is also very solid, because you're playing as an individual player, there's a lot of real coordination and technique that makes it so different from playing, say Fifa. It's so refreshing to play a sport game that brings out something that most of those games don't, and it's the indidviduality of the players. The want to stand out among others, or to stay behind and support your friends, that's the ingenuity of Rocket League.

It does lack in content however. It may be offputting that the simple, Soccer-based mode is really the only mode in the game, and a lot of the maps are in a similar layout, but that's what makes this game feel so refined. It's excusable because it's so fun to continue playing match after match. It's like Soccer; It never gets old.

It's presentation is solid too. It has a surprisingly beast soundtrack, with the likes of Hollywood Principle stealing the show. It's visuals, while not on par with big Triple AAA games, looks crisp and beautiful. The grass on the fields look mighty damn shiny, and the cars models are smiplistic and detailed.

Psyonix did a fantastic job taking a good concept, execute it once, and refine it years later into a much more enjoyable experience. Rocket League may not have a ton of maps, or game modes, but what it has is a game that will continues to amaze (and ♥♥♥♥) me to all sorts of levels.

TL;DR - Rocket League is a energetic and satisfying game that feels more like soccer then games like Fifa. And that's weird.

												This one is a masterpiece, shining like a diamond in my Steam Collection. Soccer with cars? Why not! The learning curve presented here is one of the greatest I've seen in years, both rewarding and satisfying. You can actually feel and see how much better you're becoming after every single hour spent in Rocket League. Developers are pushing updates and fixes every single month, often surprising us with completely new game modes like Rumble and Hoops. Wanna hear more? All updates are free of charge! DLC's are not ""PayToWin"" contest offering small visual enhancements instead.

tl;dr BEST. GAME. EVER.

												I play this too much.

I'm sure you've already heard numerous great things about this game. I can definitely agree to them. This game screams fun regardless of if you've played 1 hour or 1000 hours. Even if you're losing, you find yourself having fun. And that's the mark of a seriously great game, in my eyes.

Rocket League can be played casually or competitively, boasting both unranked and ranked queues. It is a simple enough concept that people are already familiar with even before playing their first game (it's damn soccer dude, if you don't know you've been living under a rock very far away from Europe, possibly on the moon Europa). But then, it has such an incredibly high skillcap. You'd probably still be learning new manouevres and the like well into 2000 hours (give it time though).

I don't play with a controller as I don't own one, but I know that 99% of people recommend controller over keyboard/mouse. And from an unbiased standpoint, I would agree, as the analogs make ball control and fine movement much easier than WASD or the like. Regardless, if you do choose to play keyboard like a dummie (read: like me), then consider making a custom bind that doesn't use the mouse.

I could go on and on. But I'll let the game do the talking; go buy it. Believe me, for $20, this is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing steal. Best $20 I ever spent tbh.

10/10 would play again (actually am playing as I write this)

												Update 1The new map ""Aqua Dome"" is incredibly resource-intensive: I usually play RL on fairly low settings without lags or framerate drops, but this map seems to require an enormously better hardware. It is constantly lagging and the framerate drop makes this map unplayable. I do not really see, why it was necessary to implement a map with significantly higher graphic requirements: Basically, I have to leave every other game. 

Update 2 Same goes for Starbase ARC.

Update 3 You might have guessed it already: Same goes for the new Dropshot map. It performs slightly better than Aquadome. 


ENGLISH: I absolutely enjoyed playing this game, for it has an interesting gameplay (soccer = cool, racing = cool, both combined = awesome). 
What I particularly dislike and what made it hard to be fun is the community, especially in 'Ranked' mode: Usually you end up with a special someone who enjoys ruining the other player's game and therefore their rank: Constantly crashing his teammate on purpose, scoring own goals, swearing or spamming. While you can report these people, all of them state, that they get reported 10 times/day and they do not have to face any consequences at all. 
If Psyonix solves this issue, playing will be fun again. If not, I will have to stick to teaming up with a steam friend who is not a total ♥♥♥♥. 
Offline/AI games are no alternative: The bots seem to be demanding enemies when you start playing, but soon, when you reach a certain skill level, they become rather unchallenging pushovers.

DEUTSCH: Mir hat das Spiel immer sehr gefallen, es hat ein wirklich interessantes Gameplay (Fussball = cool, Autos = cool, beides zusammen = wahnsinnig gut).
Was ich wirklich hasse und was meiner Meinung nach den Spaß versaut hat, ist die Community, besonders im ""Ranked"" Modus: Normalerweise wird man mit irendeinem Spezialisten gepaart, der es unglaublich toll findet den Anderen das Spiel und damit auch den Rank zu versauen: Dauerhaftes Rammen des Teamkollegen, Eigentore, Beleidigungen und Rumgespamme. Natürlich kann man die Leute inzwischen auch melden, aber nach Aussage dieser Leute, hat das selbst bei täglichen Meldungen keine Auswirkungen. 
Wenn Psyonix das irgendwie in den Griff bekommt, macht Spielen auch wieder Spaß. Wenn nicht, muss ich mit einem meiner Steamfreunde, die keine Idioten sind, zusammen spielen. 
Offline-Spiele gegen die KI sind auch keine wirkliche Alternative: Die Bots scheinen am Anfang wirklich hartnäckig zu sein,  sobald man aber den Dreh raus hat, spielt man auch die ""Allstars""-Bots mit 8:0 an die Wand."

												It's not often I feel the need to laud praises on a game I buy, but this game is an absolute gem. The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay is responsive, slick and fast-paced, offering enough diverse actions to keep you entertained for hours. The game smacks of ""Quick to learn, a lifetime to Master"", which is something I absolutely love in games like this.

I've encountered no bugs, no glitches and I can't for the life of me understand how I can get this much fun out of this little money."

												An incredible game created by incredible developers that care for quality and their fans. Psyonix have put so much effort into creating this car football sequel and have delivered exactly what fans from the community have asked for. (And more!)

The visuals are colourful, over the top and impressive.
Physics and gameplay are perfect and the game plays just how it should.
Loads of customisation items. Literally millions of different combinations.
The online is very very stable.
Various ways to play with friends including up to 4 player split screen.
Cross play for PC and PS4.
A season mode for offline play.
Replay editor which also acts as a photo mode is a very welcome feature.
Future support for the game confirmed, including DLC and free stadiums.
Day one release on PlayStation Plus for free is a wonderful bonus and a very loyal move from Psyonix to their fans.

This game is tons of fun and is the most fun I've had with a game in ages. You won't regret picking this up. Although you may never put it down."

												Rocket League is a game that is best played with a group of friends. There is just something about a team gelling so well that you can dominate another with relative ease. Although competitive, it is a fantastic game to just sit back and relax with. This is especially true when using a controller.

The customisation options for the vehicles in this game are plentiful and really allow the player to stand out. Although, a small minor update to allow the painting of the wheels would be nice...

A vast selection of options for private matches are available to change, meaning you can create some rather interesting matches at times.

Overall, the game is great and can easily be played by almost anyone with 5 minutes of free time."

- I won the kickoff
- *controller turns off for no reason*
- I write in the chat: ""My controller isn't working""
- The enemy waits
- I get my controller working again
- We continue

People are nice


Now, the actual game



Pros:
- Nice graphics
- Really good physics
- Fun with friends
- Easy to learn, hard to master
- Mutators settings (really fun to mess around with.. You can adjust the ball size, the boost amount, change the ball to a puck etc.)
- The maps are cool 
- Doesn't require a really high specs computer
- Rumble mode is really fun for casual players


Cons:
- You haven't bought the game yet"

												If you're looking for a great game to play online with others, either casually or competitively, or just to have a good time with some friends, there probably isn't a better choice than Rocket League. - It's fun, fast paced, hectic, hilarious, and both challenging, yet simple, all at the same time.
 
It doesn't matter if you only play games that are on the simple side, or ones that are extremely difficult. It really is the sort of game that just about everyone could have a great time playing, and you don't even have to be good at it, or like sports. 
 
The only real downside to this game, if you do intend to play online, is the terrible nature of the community (like with most online games). It's probably best just to disable both voice and text chat in the options, as almost nobody says anything of value. Even the quick-chat is highly abused and used by players mostly just to taunt and harass others. 
 

It really is a must-buy, though, especially if you're looking for a fun game that actually has an active player base."

												Rocket League is a game by the studio that made the free-to-play game Nosgoth that punches far above its weight. It is easy to learn, with a pair of tutorials that can be completed in under ten minutes and is almost immediately fun. However, the addiction starts to set in when you push yourself to start mastering the game.

Your first few matches will feel chaotic and hinging entirely on chance. As you acclimate to the controls and physics, you become more confident within the game world and find yourself capable of intentionally performing maneuvers. That becomes a turning point in the game and as you perfect these skills, there comes an incredible elation when you line a shot up -- probably with an assist from another driver -- and nail that in. All with determined calculation, rather than random luck.

The modes and arenas have minor variants, but are consistent. It quickly becomes a game pitting carthletes against each other and nothing else. True tests of skill and reflex. There aren't really even any modifications that impact skill, either. All the adding trappings you unlock are cosmetic. The game has ranked and unranked multiplayer of different team sizes and single player with a season/tournament campaign. That's it. That's all it needs.

My only negative experience has been with AI/Bots. They are uncannily talented and whether they're on your team or the opposition, they can ruin the game. When you are the only human on your team, there's no joy in absolutely trouncing the other team, because you know it's because of the unfair advantage the bots provided you. Perhaps this is better in the Ranked league, but in general play, there are a lot of people who just drop out, midgame. I do not know if these are occurring because of network issues in this overwhelmingly popular (and therefore still trying to ramp up server and network capacity) game or if they're just poor sports. Either way, having bots substitute is frustrating -- and they don't seem to do match-making for in-progress games, to substitute slots with real players.

Back to the positives though -- and this is a big one. You will almost immediately be in awe at how glitzy and shiny the world looks. The game has a great art style and fantastic presentation. Slick and not quite realistic, but very high quality. And the world is smooth. High framerate with, in my experience, absolutely no hitching or lagging or anything else. The game is smooth as silk.

I find this a surprise, because it seems like a game that by all rights should be a bit janky. It should come with caveats and ""for the price point"" justifications. It doesn't, though. It's an excellent experience that feels well-crafted. It sets a framework for itself and stays within it, polishing what it does well rather than expanding endlessly upon it, poorly.

If the trailer and live streams make this game seem appealing to you, I'd advice picking it up even at the $20 USD price. As long as the playerbase is still there when there is a big sale, that sale is going to be a no-brainer. If this game is found for $10 USD over the next few months, through the holidays -- it is going to be a downright steal. There is so much fun to be had here. Even more so, if you have a couple friends to build a team with.

This is a total gem that I have no reservations about recommending.

If you want to see some gameplay starting from the first time the game is launched, the following is a six hour live stream of Rocket League (begins about 5m into the video):

												I bought this game when it was really young, it was around a month after release. At the beginning the game was really difficult to play, but after a while you will master it. You should ONLY play this game if you have some kinda controller, cause with Keyboard and Mouse it is almost impossible to play this game. Think about this for yourself and decide if you want to own this game:

- Like to smash cars? BUY IT!
- Like to fly like never before? BUY IT!
- Like racing and football? BUY IT!


I really recommend it. It's the best game I have ever played so far. Why? Almost every month there is a new DLC or update for the game, so it keeps me really exited! 10/10 IGN."

												I remember back when I was a kid and got my first RC Car.
It was an epic moment that I'll never forget.
Now I can enjoy that exiting feeling combined with the sports
I like, football. The idea is genuine and the concept is 
well done and simple. Hit an ridiculous large ball with 
parts of your car to transport it into the oppenen's goal.
The physics giving a good feeling. You need a bit of time
to get the ball movement at start. The different cars to choose 
are only cosmetic besides the more or less ""hitbox"".
I think the fair environment is part of the big success.
No pay to win or other advantages. 
Matchmaking is most times quick .
One thing I would wish for is an option not to join already
running matches.
Afterall I would say that the game is worth the price.
I had hours of fun playing together with friends.
Who is looking for kind teammates can write on my wall
to request an invite for my new RL dedicated group
called ""Rocket League Fair Play""."

												This game is fun at all skill levels.  It's intuitive to learn the rules and difficult to master the mechanics and strategy.  Rocket League is one of the most unique, innovative games around.  I originally bought it when it came out thinking $20 for a weekend of fun would be worth it, but a couple thousand hours later it's still challenging and enjoyable.  My #1 game since it came out.  Much love to Psyonix <3"

You'll find yourself playing hours upon hours with Rocket League. It's a must have game, and just about anybody can play it. 
I'd have to give Rocket League 9 - 1/2 out of 10. only because I don't like the match making system. I think it's a little broken to be honest.
You'll have a good amount of vehicles to choose from the get go with coustom paint jobs, stickers, hats and other crazy things. (DLC's) are worth getting too.
An amazing soundtrack. The music in this game gets a 10/10.
It's an awesome game to just have fun with with friends or family and is well worth buying.

Edit...
As of today, I can honestly say ranked matches are foocked! I'm sick to death of going in to a match with awesome team mates one game and to then go into the next match with AFK's and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's a never ending cycle. Within the last fifty matches, I haven't moved up or down ranks at all.  
The game is still awesome, just stay in unranked if you want to enjoy it."

												Got the game for a solid 20 euro and it is worth the money.

Plus points:
+Great depth in the game, easy to pick up but hard to master
+Good user interface and options
+Fantastic music and soundtracks
+Controller support and split screen support
+Debugged game and almost no bugs left
+Good performance and also enough options to adjust and scale
+Content updates to add more content
+Easy to create steam parties and invite your friends

Minus points:
-Did not like when they introduced the crate system, atleast let players pick what item they want and not the pull the slot machine and pray on getting some you dont have yet.
-Price reduction on the crate keys, €0,25 would be more interesting and logical from a business point of view (customers would also buy it more if it was cheap)
-At the moment you cannot try any DLC cars before buying it, let there be a few test drives so users can try before buying it.
-No DLC bundles, make some bigger packs so you can buy DLC in larger and cheaper packs."

												Amazingly fun game that has all the fun elements of FIFA without the tedious bits.

If you've seen videos of Rocket League and think ""gee that would be hard to learn"" you're wrong and you're right. It's very easy to pick up but to pull off crazy aerials is hard and will take many, many hours to master.

The matchmaking service seems to work quite well and it's quick so if it does get things wrong and puts you in a game which is too easy or too hard it's not a big deal to look for another match.

Best to play with at least one friend so you can 2v2 others without having to deal with team mates dropping out or rage quitting.

I waited for it to be on sale but honestly it's worth full price. Hell I would happily have paid $50 for it. It's that fun."

												You have to play this to understand the appeal - watching the trailer does not do it justice.

This is a no-brainer, so I will keep it short. Rocket League is so over-the-top utterly addicting and blood-pumping insane, that its really hard to come up with anything negative about it. Its soccer/football with jacked-up racecars. 

Pros:
+Graphics are crisp and just overall amazing
+Controls are intuitive
+Amazing amount of content
+Overall the whole thing is super well done
+Playing online is so simple, and the score system and leaderboards are perfectly created
+They even threw in four player local splitscreen 
+There are nearly 150,000 players on at any given time
+Complete car customization, and you earn new parts and stuff all the time

Cons:
-Twenty bones sounds expensive until you try it ;)

My god buy this already."

												Rocket League is a perfect game for short breaks. 5 minutes of flying and exploding cars, then I can continue doing whatever I was doing before. (To be honest, it usually ends up in ""one more match"" multiple times. That's how it's good.)

The game is easy to learn and just fun to play. Making the perfect aerial shot, passing to a goal, saving the ball from reaching your goal at the last possible moment, failing hard and scoring an own goal... These are all moments you will see in Rocket League.

Are you in a mood for tactical game? Play 2v2. Do you want chaos? Play 4v4.

I love car customization. Who doesn't want to have a car with sombrero and rainbow trail?

												OverviewRocket League is a very popular, iconic multi-platform game that doesn't do much, but it gets by formidably with the few it has. Speaking as someone not interested in either cars nor football (Yes, football. The real one!), this game is incredibly addictive, and worthwhile if you have a few friends to play with.

The Pros:Incredibly Fun - Simple concept, easy to get the hang of but with a very high skill ceiling to keep you motivated in playing for a long time. Scoring some trick shot goals or plain luck bounces of the wall both fill the adrenaline in your soul. Winning is rewarding, and losing just makes you want a rematch.

Great Visuals - The level of detail is pretty decent, and cranking up the settings at maximum really gives it a nice feel in terms of visuals. The car models are very detailed, weather effects are decent, and praise the Gods for the adjustable FoV!

Customization - Playing unlocks car parts to customize your ride with. You can unlock several car bodies, paint types, wheels, hats (yes, TF2 style), exhaust particles and antennas. There are loads of possibilities and you can feel the car is truly yours. The only gripe I have with this is that you cannot save multiple ""load-outs"" and you cannot have a different setup based on team color. (Some accessories look godly on Red but awful on Blue and vice versa.)

Game Customization - You can host private matches with all sorts of modifiers, from gravity, to ball size, to boost speed, time and goal limits, anything! Go crazy and experiment!

Good Influx of Content - About once a month or two, new content is added. A new map here, a few more antennas there, a new game mode sprinkled once every season.  

The Cons:Unfair Input Method Balance - Unfortunately for us PC Purists out there, this game was designed for controllers. Specifically, the boost flying. Doing it on a keyboard is next to impractical, it is very unintuitive and hard to master. You can still play very well with a keyboard, but face against a team of controller users and you will be in for a bad time. The simplest fix that I CANNOT BELIEVE they didn't implement: The option to sort matchmaking for different input methods.

Horrendous Matchmaking - The system is mainly broken. If you play ranked, you will occasionally find yourself in a match with people 30 levels above you, because they play with a newbie friend that is unranked. It seems the game gives the team rating by calculating the average ranks of the members, and ignores Player level completely. So if players who are Veterans + but did not play ranked will be matched with anyone with their same rank.

Community is a bit Toxic - Not being PC or defensive, just a tad warning that you will get the (albeit maturer than) CoD attitude of ""lol newb get rekt"" from time to time.

Paid DLC-specific Achievements - There are new car DLCs to buy and fortunately they are purely cosmetic... but they decided to add achievements to them, so achievement hunters beware! You can't perfect this game without taking out your wallet because they decided it's a real challenge to ""Win an Online Match with this new Car!"".
ConclusionDespite the shortcomings, this game is incredibly fun. But do not purchase alone! Convince three friends to get it too and buy the 4-pack. Aside from better price, you will get a vastly superior experience when playing with people you know.

As an American, the only way a game of footy is entertaining to me is if it's played a few middle aged fat blokes in Toyota Yarises. Thankfully, there is someone out there who is a whiz programmer that  has put together a game that entertains people like me and I am sure a few ""football"" fans as well. Rocket League is built upon simple mechanics that are easy to pick up but difficult to master. Jumps, boosts and wallrides can be strung together into insane acrobatics that foist the ball into the net. You can customize the aesthetics of your ride by putting in time and unlocking goodies and competative online play make this a title you will come back to over and over. It's insane to think it has taken so long for a satifying vehicle based soccer game to pop up here on steam."

												Addictive Racecar Football. Surprisingly competitive once you learn a few basic maneuveres, after this you begin to climb the skill tier. Simple yet efficient tiers break up the skill gaps into pools at a decent rate for beginners. As a rookie you will spalsh around with the other casuals and gain a grasp for hitting the ball and maintaining control of the car. Next comes Semi-pro, in this pool you start to get a feel and learn to see where the ball is flying and position yourself accordingly. At Pro you're on your way, this is where the community opens up and stratergies become more meta and kick offs take some priority. Veteran feels like you're being thrown in teh deep end because higher tier Veterans have advanced onto flying with that car and Aerials become the go to plan of attack. Expert is where Crossing is how to beat the defence line having someone in the air to topple enemy teams. There are three higher tiers but im not quite there, being Master > Legend > Rocketeer. Occasionally ther servers are overloaded or lack some players so you get to be the big fish and splash around with lower tier players while the game finds some players more suited. 

Constant DLC is a awesome bonus, and new Mutator gamemodes make for an awesome custom mode with friends.

Overall a decent game, whether you're a PS4 Casual to a Competitive Player it suites all."

												I play this too much.

I'm sure you've already heard numerous great things about this game. I can definitely agree to them. This game screams fun regardless of if you've played 1 hour or 1000 hours. Even if you're losing, you find yourself having fun. And that's the mark of a seriously great game, in my eyes.

Rocket League can be played casually or competitively, boasting both unranked and ranked queues. It is a simple enough concept that people are already familiar with even before playing their first game (it's damn soccer dude, if you don't know you've been living under a rock very far away from Europe, possibly on the moon Europa). But then, it has such an incredibly high skillcap. You'd probably still be learning new manouevres and the like well into 2000 hours (give it time though).

I don't play with a controller as I don't own one, but I know that 99% of people recommend controller over keyboard/mouse. And from an unbiased standpoint, I would agree, as the analogs make ball control and fine movement much easier than WASD or the like. Regardless, if you do choose to play keyboard like a dummie (read: like me), then consider making a custom bind that doesn't use the mouse.

I could go on and on. But I'll let the game do the talking; go buy it. Believe me, for $20, this is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing steal. Best $20 I ever spent tbh.

10/10 would play again (actually am playing as I write this)

I don't normally use an exclamation point after every sentence, but in this case, I WILL!!!

Thank you Angry Joe! So glad I follow all of his episodes at times like this! :D

Original and ridiculously fun. Just the fact that it's original says a lot. Trying to be original these days is basically impossible, but here it is, in all its glory.

Cars + Soccer = I didn't realize I liked soccer till now!

9/10 - RECOMMENDED!

												Soccer with Cars!

PROS:

>A wonderfully made sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars with much better graphics, mechanics, and new content

>Psyonix took a very simple idea and made something wonderful with it. Rocket League truly is the easy to learn - hard to master game that the more you play the better you become

>Rocket League is constantly watched by its developers who update the game periodically and always deliver new free and DLC content (All DLC for this game is only cosmetic which delivers a much better experience for those who want more and doesn't effect those who don't decide to pick up the DLC)

>Rocket League provides a competitive and casual playlist for those who wish to either play for  #1 on the leaderboards or jump into a few matches here and there


>Unlike other sports games where you press a button to do an action, in Rocket League you actually have to learn moves and tricks. You control the direction of your car and how you play each and every match


CONS:

>At times I find competitive matchmaking to be off to where you get matched with players way below your skill level and sometime players way above your skill level

>Although Rocket League provides a fun and awesome experience, you don't get the full experience playing alone. I suggest picking up Rocket League with a couple of friends to make it more interesting


FINAL VERDICT:

If you do get the chance to pickup Rocket League with a few friends I suggest you do so. For 20 dollars you can't go wrong for the amount of hours you an your friends will pour into Rocket League"

												Lets start off by saying this.
If you go to the negative reviews, all you'll find is people saying...

1. ""It's laggy"" - Which used to be true, when this game was first released the servers couldn't handle 100'000's of people at once, so it lagged A LOT, but since then it's gotten a LOT better and a LOT smoother. You'll end up in a laggy match 1/50 times probably. You can also report the server you lagged in online and they'll fix it asap

2. ""My computer won't run it"" - You'll need a decent enough computer to run this game. 

3. ""I suck at this game"" - Keep Practising, trust me, EVERYONE is terrible at this game when they first play it, it's a really unique game which has never been done before so no one really knows how to play, but the more hours you put the better you get, until you start flying in the air constantly and scoring goals from the sky!

4. ""After 30 minutes, you've seen everything and it's just the same thing over and over"" - This is true. There's a lot of maps but they're all identical besides cosmetic changes. All the cars drive Almost the same way and the goal is to shoot the ball into the goal. It's better to compare it to a game like League of Legends or CSGO, you'll do the same thing over and over, but you'll but sooo many hours into it since it's fun.

The game itself is, put simply, Really really fun, any youtube video of other people playing the game will show you this. The basic description for the gameplay is you defend, dribble the ball, FLY around the map going for the ball in the sky. Save goals, gain boosts to use a boost to drive faster and higher, drive up walls to help reach a ball mid-air and try your best to score. 

There's also a lot of customisation for your car including Different types of Cars, Decal's, Antena's, Paints, different coloured cars and for those TF2 fans HAT's. There's unranked 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 gamemodes aswell as ranked 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 gamemodes (4v4 isn't considerd competitive as it's too chaotic to plan anything out), playing with a good team-mate is what really makes this game great. It's a good game to laugh and casually have fun with a friend aswell as a great E-Sports material game for those who want a competitive game (and it is competitive, a major e-sports tournement has already been held and it's amazing)

It's cheap and you'll definitly get your money's worth, as of writing this I have 168 hours into the game and I'm not slowing down."

												By now everyone knows what Rocket League is about.
I played it since it was in alpha, loved it from the first match.
With time all my friends bought it, even the ones that didn't like car/racing games or football.
We got countless hours of pure fun out of it. You can play for 10 minutes or 5 hours and still have lots of fun. 
It's easy to pick up and play, but hard to master.
It's cheap, a potato could run it and one of the best coop/competitive games out there.
Go ahead and buy it."

You'll find yourself playing hours upon hours with Rocket League. It's a must have game, and just about anybody can play it. 
I'd have to give Rocket League 9 - 1/2 out of 10. only because I don't like the match making system. I think it's a little broken to be honest.
You'll have a good amount of vehicles to choose from the get go with coustom paint jobs, stickers, hats and other crazy things. (DLC's) are worth getting too.
An amazing soundtrack. The music in this game gets a 10/10.
It's an awesome game to just have fun with with friends or family and is well worth buying.

Edit...
As of today, I can honestly say ranked matches are foocked! I'm sick to death of going in to a match with awesome team mates one game and to then go into the next match with AFK's and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's a never ending cycle. Within the last fifty matches, I haven't moved up or down ranks at all.  
The game is still awesome, just stay in unranked if you want to enjoy it."

												I don't care about cars or football so i am surprised at how addictive and fun this is.

The good:
- Fast, fun and simple gameplay that is very easy to get in to.
- Great controls with controller support.
- You can make your car wear a viking helmet.
- Very nice and detailed graphics. You can see every single individual blade of grass on the field, it's actually pretty ludicrous that it runs at a constant 60fps.
- Thousands of people are playing the game so you can jump in to a match in about 20 seconds and it's (mostly) lag free.
- Did i mention you can make your car wear a viking helmet? That's a thing.

The bad:
- Not much. It could do with some more modes but i'm sure there will be many updates considering how popular the game is."

												Rocket League - a dynamic racing game in the style of football, developed and published by Psyonix for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. The game is on 7 July 2015. This game is a sequel to the game in 2008 Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket engine Battle-Cars (SARPBC). Game gameplay is similar to the game SARPBC and includes single and multiplayer (support split screen) mode, has the opportunity to play on a local network, cross-platform Includes game and PS4 between Microsoft Windows.

 Pros: 

1. Gameplay.

The game has a couple of modes: 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2, 3 vs. 3, 4 vs. 4, 3 vs. 3 Hockey and new clothes often go to various other modes and maps.

Where online game without matchmaking? 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2, 3 vs. 3, 4 vs. 4 - for all these modes, you can get the title (rank). In each mode, its title, that is, you can sit down for a long time in one mode, in addition to it you will find more then 3. However, I highly recommend that you do not play in matchmaking, because after him, you can spoil your mood.

And yes, even in the game there are different machines and tuning them. It is very cool!

2. Team play.

The multiplayer game is fully revealed potential game ideas. The most interesting part of this. Under the bot can already be arranged, but not real players. They may be misleading, to negotiate, to use clever tactics.

3. Graphics.

The graphics for the game in 6.5 $ just excellent.

4. Soundtracks.

They are perfectly matched and fit perfectly into the gameplay.

5. The idea of ​​the game.

Indeed, this is quite an interesting idea for a game. As I wrote above, this game is like a game gempleem Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle-Cars (SARPBC), but for some reason no one remembers the game as well?Developers Psyonix have reviewed all the disadvantages SARPBC games and made a bomb

 Minuses: 

1.Random.

What did I say?
For example, you can win the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to the forty-seventh chromosome, which can not use the elementary flight, and just waiting for rebounds, banal transmission through the entire field. And, of course, it is unpleasant.

 Conclusion: 

Despite all these drawbacks, the game I loved madly.
I thought a long time, take it or not this game, because I do not like football, but in the end he took and never regretted. Excellent arcade game, which will delay than a dozen hours."

												So where do I start...

I read somewhere that the game is or was free for Playstation Live, yet PC users had to pay so that is extremely crappy!

Anyway, the game itself, that is why we are here.

Graphics: The graphics are actually pretty simple, pushed to the max that are nice to look at, simple and just nothing special really.  You do not need high resolution graphics for a game like this!

Audio: The audio is clear, crisp and really good to listen too, specially the rocket sounds of each trail you have, being different and acting different!

Controls: Depending how you play this game, the controls matter! I tried keyboard and mouse and although it is doable, it is a lot more complicated! I use an Xbox 360 controller to play this game, with BALL CAM always on and the game is suprt easy to master!

Gameplay: The gameplay is basically football but with cars... Nothing special or hard to get your head around.  There are some amazing players in the game, with some amazing shots you can make and for some odd reason, playing this game actually makes me intense and tense up at times, when taking a shot. 
The game is good fun and I would recommend this game if you like cars and/ or football... I hate football games but love car games and surprisingly this game offers an amazing balance of rockets, cars with a kinda football elemant, but in no way makes you feel like a football game.
The unlocks in the game you can get within a few hours, seriously it does not take long at all!

This game is now an E-Sports league thingy I heard, too which I am not interested in that but you can try to enter for it!

This is best to play with your friends, bringing you more fun.

Would I recommend this game? Yes!"

												I was unsure if i'd really like this game. Basically peer pressured into it, lol. As someone whos not into soccer or sports in general, This was actually OK to play. I can enjoy and get into it without any real problems. Just gotta be in the right mood. I mostly just enjoy playing with friends casually. I'm really not any good. But its also fun to watch.  So any sports haters out there. This is actually not that bad. Catch it while its on sale, try it out, have a blast, win. Lotsa fun! Cheers~"

You think you have time for your family? Think again.
You think you have time to study? Think again.

If your parents don't know or fully understand the concept of not being able to pause an online game, then I have some bad news for you.

Seriusly, can a game be flawless? F**k yeah it can! From the gameplay to the soundtrack, you will love every bit of this game. Rocket league is also one of the very few games to be an officially sponsored E-sport shortly after it's release.

												As I lifted myself up from the crusted earth bellow, I realized my grim mistake.
I left the comfortable region in which a keeper should plant himself firmly.
In the distance I saw my companions on the offensive, rushing back to help me in vain.
It was in that moment that I saw it. I would very soon miss the ball and cause my team great pain.

My thoughts were of all the other games, in those which I’ve made the very same mistake.
Yet the desire to one day succeed was strong and I could not help myself to that leap.
As the ball flew passed me, In that direction that I wished it not to. I felt as if death had gripped me.

I’ve let my comrades down, failed them and taken a selfish action for a benefit that could only be my own. As the ball graciously embraced the deep fathoms of the net, I was met with the taunts and suggestions of my sexuality. I brushed them off, as a knight brush of the lives he takes in the battlefield.

The strange thing is: That I would do it all over again, for one day I will fly through the air like a majestic winged shape, and one day I will hit that ball. My friends will cheer and my enemies will tremble, for thus my rank will be great."

												This game man this game is the juice everything you could all want and serving up to its purpose of entertainment unlike any other game.

Menu
It's the best i have seen so far it's easy as hell to navigate through and pretty next-gen as well stylish.

Music 
It's perfect suits the game in every single way there are a wide variety and most of them being electronic it's easy to listen to and enjoyable at the same time just perfect.

Gameplay 
It's fun as damm and playing football/soccer with cars really who wouldn't want that? And the best part of all FIFA has nothing to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to do with it. Wide variety of moves and it never feels unfair due to every car having the same states just different hitboxes which I doubt make a difference at all.

Controls 
The control's here are silk as smooth response as hell man just perfect response easy to get the hang of it. Many say this game is better with playing with a ""controller"" but it's not necessary with keyboard it's all fine just takes a little while to get the hang of it.

Split screen 
Yes there's split screen multiplayer and offline split screen. You are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ kidding me right are you? No I'm not it really really has spilt screen going up to 4 players just amazing just amazing I have yet to see this in any new game and yet rocket league does it like a B.0.S.S.

Customization 
Customization does not serve any purpose in gameplay it's all cosmetic effect but really who doesn't like it?

I mean making your car fire rainbows and all that ♥♥♥♥ up your ♥♥♥.

In all seriousness it's down right amazing just perfect you unlock a cosmetic item every time you complete a match there are 150 cosmetic items/effects in total and more going up in future.

Conclusion 
The hell are you waiting for and buying all those Early Access ""Survival"" games huh really?

Just stop it really just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stop it and buy rocket league only 20 dollars man cheaper then all the canes of beers you just bought today.

A simple idea but done right. amazing and fun to play. polished around the corner. great sound's and ost. matching environments and nice graphics.

												Rocket League is a great example on how to take a simple idea  and make it an incredible game. The game is easy to get into but hard to master. At first glance it may seem that this game is just about who gets to hit the ball , but there is more to it . Ball control and tactics takes time to learn. The one major complaint i have about the game is the poor matchmaking from my experience. Either i play with people who are worse than me or people who are  way better than me , what happened to match people with similiar skillset. And the south east asia servers are ♥♥♥♥ in this game.

Great fun in short bursts - 8.5/10"

												Soccer with rocket cars?  Yes, please!  

This game is finely crafted multiplayer perfection (and the single player modes are great too), with the right touch of chaos to go along with skillful gameplay.  Even when you mess up a great shot or send the ball flying into your own goal, you'll have a lot of fun doing it.  I expect the skill ceiling for this game to be very, very high over time, but it's forgiving enough that even people who feel overwhelmed by other online games can have a lot of fun and contribute to the team. 

An absolute steal for the price - if you buy it, you'll keep playing, and playing, and playing....

												It's like soccer: Because, you know... it's soccer.
It's like Civilization: ""just one more turn/match"". You will find yourself up way later than you were planning.
It's like racqueball: Even if you suck, it is fun as hell just hitting the ball around and trying new stuff.
It's like skateboarding: Tricks accomplished through precise movement and timing.

It's so easy (and fun) to pick up and learn. It's so satisfying to begin hitting harder and harder shots. It is a blast at every point in the learning curve (which seems to extend into infinity)."

												 An Amazing Sports GamePeople have plenty of misconceptions about this game. Its not simply soccer with cars.

Rocket League is an adrenaline-pumping, itch-feeding, finger-mashing, explosive sports game. It is the result of a great clusterball of imagination, vision and execution. You control a car, with rocket boosts that allow you to manouver in the air, jump and perform bicycle kicks. Unlike regular football fields, you are playing in a specially designed cages that allow you free movement. Since the fields are closed, the action runs seamlessly.

The biggest difference that derails from the old formula of sports game is the fact that you only control a single entity. You do not switch from one ragdoll to another to perform incredible feats. You communicate with one-another on an electric level that when executed perfectly sends chill down your spine. 

With insane avatars capable of withstanding the severest laws of gravity, the presence of each individual in the field matter. Not once or twice, the game countlessly put you in exhilarating situations akin to football strikers: preventing a tiebreaker from being scored during the last moments of the round or giving an impossible sommersault pass with the last sliver of nitros that leads to an impressive aerial goal by your teammate. 

Instead of placing features that exist in today's meta, Rocket League opted for a more traditional approach. You will find no such character progression, career mode or ability unlocks in this game. What will keep you playing will simply be the charm of performing stunning moves, outmanouvering and outsmarting your opponents over and over again, one game after another. 

It's just another 5 minutes after all...

												This game makes soccer (football) extremely fun due to being a car with rockets. You will learn to control your car to hit the ball in various angles. Then you will jump and hit the ball and using your second jump (or dodge depending on direction) to navigate the battlefield or hit the ball harder. Then you will learn the beautiful art of rocket ballet as you use your boost to fly for short periods of time while scoring goals. Mix all those elements with teamwork for a simple, yet extremely complex game filled with sick plays, amazing comebacks, and did he just score a goal flying backwards? What!?

Forget FIFA. Play Rocket League.

I should now mention that their post-launch support has been nothing short of amazing. I don't agree with their decision to include gambling boxes for cosmetics (I prefer to buy things directly), but the amount of free content and excellent modes has been substantial. Rumble has been one of the best modes they've added to the game. The other bonus modes have their own followings too. Some people just play Hockey League exclusively.

Rocket League has incredibly fun gameplay and is backed by a great developer. I just hope they avoid becoming a money hungry monster, but they've been doing a splendid job so far.

They've added a training mode where you can create playlists of different shots for scoring or defending. This is the best addition to the game since Rumble and is incredibly fun to play. I enjoy both making and experiencing what others have created."

												I'm not really a huge fan of driving games. I'm not really a huge fan of sports games.

But this........ this rules.

Rocket League is one of the most addictively fun games I have ever played. The graphical presentation and flow of the animations is sharp, fluid and perfect, just like the control and response (regardless of whether you prefer keyboard/mouse or controller).

The soundtrack selection is wonderful.

The insane amount of unlockable content, combined with some really reasonably priced DLC adds to its replayability and sense of progression. Playing a new vehicle is like installing a brand new game.

This game really puts you in a competitive state of mind. It's a type of intense that keeps you wanting to come back. Scoring asinine goals and making big saves and assists in Rocket League is one of the most satisfying experiences I've ever had the pleasure of having in a video game.

Don't pass it up. It'll be your loss."

												Rocket League...The game that took the gaming scene by surprise. Personally, I don't enjoy car games, racing games, or sports games. Especially not soccer. Then why does this game interest me so much?

I have no idea. 

Nevertheless, I haven't been able to play hardly any other games for my newfound love for thrust sticks attached to what look like toy cars. You'll start out jump-flipping into the ball, and being amazed at how you hit it just right to make your first goal. Then you'll experiment with boosting after you jumped. ""I hit it!"" you say. Finally, you were able to touch the ball while it soars 50 feet above the ground. As you cascade to the field, you realize that the death-defying acrobatic maneuver was just enough to tip the ball into your goal"

												Let's get it out of the way: this may be the single best multiplayer game of recent years. Why, you may ask?

It's a simple enough concept but executed almost perfectly and then honed and polished to a shine. It's the very idea of ""easy to learn, hard to master"". The controls are intuitive and the mechanics so straightforward that you'll grasp them within minutes. And yet it will probably take you hundreds of hours to master all the intricacies of its systems. While beginner level games take place mostly on the ground, high level play gains a whole other vertical dimension and pro games are a spectacle to behold. And the best thing: it's a fun experience all along the way!

Psyonix also made a couple of sound decisions during its development: cross-platform play guarantees a large playerbase for the years to come, unlocked, dropped and bought items (there is a ""key & crate"" system in place) are cosmetic in nature only (no stat boosting) and the DLC cars handle the same (except turn radius) as every other car in the game and only differ in their hitbox. The camera settings are also completely customizable (FOV up to 110) to accommodate a wide range of playstyles.

Be aware that due to the nature of the game, competitive game modes can be a salt mine of gigantic proportions. Fortunately enough, Psyonix provide different filter settings for voice and text chat to make sure this game can even be enjoyed by adolescents (and me).

Highly recommended!"

												IntroductionI've often found myself with little pockets of time in which I've wondered, ""What should I do now?"". You know, those moments in time where you have too little time to play a really lengthy, story-driven game (or League of Legends), but way more time than you can feasibly sit and idle. It's as if our prayers were collectively answered with this fantastic game from Psyonix; Rocket League.

Take out your controllers boys & girls, we're playing football....with cars.

GameplayI've been playing games like Fifa and PES from the glory '98 days, but eventually my interests changed. After all, it was simply a game of football. There is only so much you can do with human players. Apparently Psyonix thought outside of the box. What they delivered was simply a stroke of genius. Gone were the human players we were accustomed to. Instead, rocket-powered cars jetted their way across the map in record speeds. This wasn't enough though. They altered the map, super-sized the ball, and set each player in control of only one car at a time.

This formula gave birth to the high-intensity game of Rocket League. Your goal is to hit the massive ball into the opponent's goal. Sounds simple enough right? Wrong. With rocket jumps, speed boosts, rocket-propelled flight and the unique map shapes, you'll find yourself in an endless chase at breakneck speed for possession of the ball. While this game is absolutely beginner friendly, it has an insanely high skill-ceiling. In other words, no matter how good you think you are, there is someone who is leagues above you.

Each team can have up to 5 players, though the 3v3 format is the standard mode, and has a nice balance between chaos and fun. The potential teamwork between players is definiely one of my favourite aspects, and promotes friendly behavior for those epic goals. Don't be surprised if you get called out for accidentally hitting the ball away from the opponent's goal, or worse, hitting it into your own.

Quick-chat commands are rather peaceful, but after seeing 3 censored swear words, you'll probably get the idea. The sarcastic tones of ""What a Save!"" upon scoring a goal always gives me a chuckle, and the genuine compliments from opponents is a welcome breath of fresh air, and pride.

Car selection & customization should probably be a mini-game on its own. With a wide variety of colours, hats, boost trails and decals to choose from, you'll likely have more than a few saved presets that you'll cycle through. With an ever-growing roster of cars and cosmetics, there's plenty to appeal to everyone.

Speaking of appeal, there's much more than your classic game of football in Rocket League. Games such as basketball and hockey have found their way into the ever-growing list of game modes, and I often find myself cycling through them all quite frequently. Hell, even my 5 year old cousin loves it. Think you've got the skills to make it higher? You'll be happy to test your skills in the competitive mode. To be honest, I haven't really played much of this, since I prefer the other modes so much more.

VisualsDon't let its colourful nature confuse you, rocket league is one beautiful & optimized game. I was pleasantly surprised to discover how easy it was to run on even some old potatoes, and its ability to be quite visually appealing on higher settings. The explosions and particle effects are both colourful and beautiful. The cars are nicely detailed, and the animations are right on point. 

AudioIf you for some reason haven't listened to Rocket League's soundtrack, get it...now. I find myself upset that it's not on by default while playing, but there are plenty of workarounds to really listen and enjoy the music all year round. The tracks are entertaining and insanely high quality. 

Soundtrack aside, the regular SFX are no less impressive. Vehicle sounds, explosions, and the 'fake crowd' cheering are just a few of the many things this game has to offer for your audiophile needs.

Summary & ConclusionWhether you've got only 5 minutes to spare, or an entire afternoon, Rocket League offers hours of addictive fun that never seems to grow old. This unique spin on a timeless sport is sure to appeal to a very wide audience, and you can be sure that your experience is likely gonna be a great one.

For $20, this game is worth full price, but you can always get it on sale pretty often.
I rarely grant this one but,

10/10 - Just simply fun, addicting and worth every penny.

Props to the devs for showing that an independent team could release such a big hit without submitting to the horrible DLC practices of modern gaming.

												Rocket League is basically football (Soccer) with a car BUT WAIT.... The cars are supersonic, they're acrobatic, they're rocket powered and, they're battle cars! This game is unbelievably fun, even if you dont like this sort of game, i'm yet to meet anyone who has a bad word to say about Rocket League. This is a game that anyone can pick up, no matter what your skill level is, however the skill cap for this game is incredibly high, so it's fun for the casual gamer and the hardcore gamers. I would reccommend this to literally anyone, and i challenge you to play it and not like it!

Matchmaking
You get opposed to people around the same skill-level as you when you play ranked.
The matchmaking in Rocket League is good, compared to some other games out there.

Although the matchmaking is good, they might want to work on their AI a bit, because the AI is pretty much god-like.

Matchmaking8/10
Controller support
The game supports and recommends the use of a controller because it makes the game more enjoyable, as of now I haven't seen anyone but 1 of my friends play without a controller, and according to him its hard.

The overall controller support is good, but because most people out there don't have a controller (except nearly everyone playing Rocket League) I will give this a lower score. 

Controller support7/10
Graphics
Rocket League visually looks amazing, really. Futuristic style perfectly underlines the speed and agility of the gameplay, Unreal Engine is ideal for playing with such style. Machines, which you can customize a little, they look great. Stadiums look impressive and epic. The people in the stands feel like they're living, it also has a great merit of the sound component. The crowd was responsive to everything that happens in the stadium: close to the enemy goal post? The crowd was jubilant. You fought off the ball that is about to get to the gate? The crowd will be surprised and will scream so you know you've done good. All the sound effects are high quality, and made perfectly.

												For something as simple as soccer/football played with turbo-powered cars, Rocket League is way more in-depth and entertaining than it might appear on the surface. Fast-paced, clean-looking, and hard not to enjoy even when you're losing or making embarrassing mistakes, this game will give you plenty of moments where you're geeking out over some incredible shot, save, or block - and it will give you just as many moments of intense, stress-inducing close calls or just-barely-missed opportunities.

Played like a much smaller (player-wise) version of soccer/football - with several variations like 1 vs 1, 3 vs 3 (the standard), 4 vs 4, etc. - Rocket League is an interesting mix of competitive sports and driving/racing, pitting players against each other on two teams in five minute matches. An interesting twist, however, is the rocket-powered aspect of the cars and the ""boost"" fuel that players have to pick up and manage throughout the match. While it might seem like something strictly used for speed, it plays into essentially every aspect of the game, from controlling yourself in the air to making/blocking shots as well as to take other players out. With both resource management and getting a feel for how the cars control or the ball works, the game can feel very random and chaotic at first, often leaving you feeling like any play you make is chance or luck; to me, however, this is where Rocket League's longevity and replayability really comes into play. 

You might be clueless initially and have no idea what you're doing (yet still manage to make plays), but the game unfolds more and more as you play and get your bearings. While one match you're barely struggling to hit the ball in the air, soon enough you'll hit them every time and come to find that as you practice you have way more control over the game and yourself than the chaotic atmosphere might let on. The high-flying bounces, the impossible-to-save/strike shots - it all will eventually be something you can not only handle consistently, but also open you up to the other techniques in the game like aerial movement/shots and boost control.

Combine the solid gameplay and skill progression with an easy-to-use interface and good soundtrack (which should totally have an option to enable during matches!) and Rocket League is a surprisingly fun, easy-to-play but hard-to-master game that's both something you can pick up every now and then as well as play for hours."

The learning curve presented here is one of the greatest I've seen in years, both rewarding and satisfying.

												Less than 10 hours into Rocket League and I've already gotten 30+ achievements, not that it matters, it just means that the game is just that addictive and fun.

We can also demolish other people who play badly, which is a great plus to get some annoyance off.

Nothing much to say, it's a great and addictive game that everyone should give a try.

10/10 would demolish other cars again."

Everyone, welcome Rocket League to the world :)


More Thoughts on the game?

Rocket League is just a ton of fun, if you enjoy good gameplay check this out. When you have a team working together it is a thing of beauty. You might be helping out on offense alot one game, while another player might be making some great saves coming back on defense, or you all might do a little of everything, etc.. Teamwork is rewarded and if you are at all interested in this game pick it up asap. The graphics look nice, it runs well, its a joy to play and the controls are well done, get your engines started and get ready for some action packed fun!"

												Rocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple, absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn’t need a ton of extra features around it. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle-kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just “one more match,” even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great, goofy, easy to learn and difficult to master action-sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds"

												10/10 ­- I Hate Racing Games, I Hate Soccer Games; I LOVE Them Together!

I never like reviewing games that everyone has played but I must check this off the list and get it done! Rocket Leauge is one of the most impressive games to come out in the last few years in my humble opinion. The replay value is nuts; you can keep playing almost indefinitely without getting bored. There is a pretty big learning curve but once you get the hang of things the rewards are great!

This game is a soccer game but instead of sending troops into battle you send 3­4 cars into the arena! What could possibly make this better?! How about strapping rockets onto the back of your ride! There is a great deal of skill involved but even if you suck you will have tons of fun. I have worked my way from easy to hard on single player and I felt like my skills were pretty solid, winning most matches. I quickly realized though I’m still not that good; other players are always better and the difference in skill levels are vast! So don’t be discouraged when you start getting whooped on multiplayer!

Overall, this is a real gem! Make sure you computer is strong enough for multiplayer because it will definitely use more resources. You can often find this game for about $15 now so lookout for that deal!

												Day 1 - ""Wow! This game is fun!""
Day 25 - ""Wow! Those pro players are amazing!""
Day 91 - ""I must get better.""
Day 180 - ""I've played every day since I bought this game. Send help.""

Day 384 - ""This game literally inhabits my dreams.  Carball is all I know.  ""


 In all seriousness... 
This game is ridiculously fun. Unlike a sports simulation where you simply press a button to pass or shoot, you're given total control over a Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Car. You physically ram your vehicle into the ball to dribble, pass, and shoot. The concept is ludicrous and results in one of the best games I've personally ever played.

At low levels, the game is slow paced as people become accustomed to the mechanics, but never does it cease to harbor massive levels of enjoyment. As the game opens up (from your skill and grasp of the controls), you'll start to see the game in a totally different way. Everywhere on (and above) the field is now open to play, and you can start creating teamplay opportunities you never thought possible. The game progressives like such throughout your time playing, and the skill ceiling is incredibly high (if not non-existant). I'll spare you my ranting, but regardless of winning, losing, or who I was playing with or against, it has always been a good time. 

On a different note, the game is almost nearly as amazing to watch as it is to play. The ""Rocket League Championship Series""[twitch.tv] is the official Psyonix/Twitch partnered eSports event. Alongside the pro's, there is competition at nearly every level. The community is bright and active, and the devs are some of the most interactive and supportive creators I have ever seen in the game industry. Please take a chance, grab some friends, and give this game a try. It will be fun. And once you're hooked, be sure to come hang out on the subreddit or check out the dedicated fan site (http://rocket-league.com) to learn more about the community and rapidly growing eSports scene."

												You have to play this to understand the appeal - watching the trailer does not do it justice.

This is a no-brainer, so I will keep it short. Rocket League is so over-the-top utterly addicting and blood-pumping insane, that its really hard to come up with anything negative about it. Its soccer/football with jacked-up racecars. 

Pros:
+Graphics are crisp and just overall amazing
+Controls are intuitive
+Amazing amount of content
+Overall the whole thing is super well done
+Playing online is so simple, and the score system and leaderboards are perfectly created
+They even threw in four player local splitscreen 
+There are nearly 150,000 players on at any given time
+Complete car customization, and you earn new parts and stuff all the time

Cons:
-Twenty bones sounds expensive until you try it ;)

My god buy this already."

												Rocket League is a perfect game for short breaks. 5 minutes of flying and exploding cars, then I can continue doing whatever I was doing before. (To be honest, it usually ends up in ""one more match"" multiple times. That's how it's good.)

The game is easy to learn and just fun to play. Making the perfect aerial shot, passing to a goal, saving the ball from reaching your goal at the last possible moment, failing hard and scoring an own goal... These are all moments you will see in Rocket League.

Are you in a mood for tactical game? Play 2v2. Do you want chaos? Play 4v4.

I love car customization. Who doesn't want to have a car with sombrero and rainbow trail?

												OK first of all its a shame that most negative reviews are based on first 2 days after release where the team of devs had some problems with the servers. They worked day an night and now everything is working fine at least for me.

So, i played this game on Beta on PS4 and i was pretty hyped about the launch. It didn't disapoint. I have it for free on PS4 and bought it on steam to play with friends.

The game is a ton of fun. The gameplay is easy to learn, hard to master.
Graphics are pretty nice and cars come with a ton of costumization options (FOR FREE).
We can face AI opponents with diferente skill levels (that can make a huge diference) or we can play vs players usually with simillar skill (sometimes u can face players really better than u but their in game rate is the same or lower than yours).
There are several game modes but the only major difference is the amount of players and ranked match or not.
Its great to play with friends. Hard to quit playing even if you're really tired.
I seriously recomend using a controller. I use my DS4 with Bluetooth (using inputmapper) and it works perfectly. For ppl using other controllers i recomend x360ce (helped 2 friend who were using a ds2 and a sega saturn controller).

A word also for the devs that seem to work night and day to fix problems. Keep up the  good work.

Great game. One of the better for sure to release this year."

												Excellent game. Not much to say apart from the fact that it's a game that looks great (graphics) and relatively cheap. Each game is on a 5 minute timer so it's a game you can pick up for a few minutes and put down again when you're just killing time.
I've spent a lot of time playing this game in gaming pubs on laptops with friends and that is the perfect atmosphere to play this game. Drink, have a laugh and score some goals.
You can play casually and just enjoy playing, eventually you'll actually get quite good. Or you can play seriously and competitively and run through the tutorials for some extra help. This is the type of game where the more you play, the better you'll become.  As you understand the physics more and get used to the way the ball moves, you'll just know where you have to be in order to score that incredible high goal.

Basically there is no reason not to get this game."

												Rocket league is a nice game to play, even if you're not into racing and/or soccer.
I'm personally not into soccer and racing either but this game amazes me because it's a lot of fun.

Things I will be talking about in this review
Matchmaking
Controller support
Graphics/sounds
Total score of the game
Matchmaking
You get opposed to people around the same skill-level as you when you play ranked.
The matchmaking in Rocket League is good, compared to some other games out there.

Although the matchmaking is good, they might want to work on their AI a bit, because the AI is pretty much god-like.

Matchmaking8/10
Controller support
The game supports and recommends the use of a controller because it makes the game more enjoyable, as of now I haven't seen anyone but 1 of my friends play without a controller, and according to him its hard.

The overall controller support is good, but because most people out there don't have a controller (except nearly everyone playing Rocket League) I will give this a lower score. 

Controller support7/10
Graphics
Rocket League visually looks amazing, really. Futuristic style perfectly underlines the speed and agility of the gameplay, Unreal Engine is ideal for playing with such style. Machines, which you can customize a little, they look great. Stadiums look impressive and epic. The people in the stands feel like they're living, it also has a great merit of the sound component. The crowd was responsive to everything that happens in the stadium: close to the enemy goal post? The crowd was jubilant. You fought off the ball that is about to get to the gate? The crowd will be surprised and will scream so you know you've done good. All the sound effects are high quality, and made perfectly.

Graphics9/10
Overall score of the game*

Also, i didn't experience a single fps drop. The game is as smooth as it can be

												Overall, this game is awesome. Yes, I know that it is $20 but, it's worth it. After 1 game of it, i got hooked. I love the idea of racing and soccer combined. The Graphics are incredible. A cool feature of this is that you can even customize your car with many combinations. Another great thing in this game is the soundtrack. The one downside (doesn't affect me) is that you will most likely need a high end computer to run this game without lag.

												Cars playing soccer/football
But wait! There is more:
Even though on the first look this game's concept appears simple and goofy, the depth of gameplay found here is insanely high. Rocket League is one of those games which allow you to do amazing plays and moves if you dedicated time and effort into it, but at the same time provide a lot of fun while played casually with friends.


What to expect
This game is the sequel to the PS3 game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars from 2008. Therefore the game idea isn't new and the gameplay doesn't differ a lot. But since the same developer Psyonix stay behind Rocket League, their experience allowed them to address problems and improve the game (as well as shorten the name :P).

Rocket League provides fast 5 minute rounds inside a box-shaped arena. The edges of the arena are curved to allow players to drive up walls and even on the ceiling. The team size can range from one to four players on each team.

The gameplay is fast and because of the playingfield's small size goals can be scored from the other side of it, since there are no obstacles in the way other than a potentional defending player. Blocking the ball and doing a counterattack right afterwards happens within seconds and can turn an entire game.


The cars
There are multiple car models to choose from, but their handling or top speed does not differ. Only the hitbox of the cars are slighly different - which creates some tiny variation in the ball interaction. However the main purpose of having multiple cars is to customize it without interfering or imbalancing the gameplay. This works very well and choosing a car is a personal preference rather than a statistical battle to determine which car is the best. The car customization comes with color, surface type, additional decal, wheels, antenna, goofy hats and particles for the rocket trail.

""Rocket trail?"" you may ask. Well, in Rocket League every car has a Rocket Engine attached to its back allowing to boost itself to greater speed. The best part is that you can jump and shoot yourself into the air with it and being able to fly. This creates gameplay in all three dimensions. Instead of just dribbling the ball on the ground, you can launch yourself into the air and hit the ball before your enemy can. It is not easy and adds a decent learning-curve to the game.


The experience
The game is very polished. The options menu allows key rebinding serparatly for keyboard and controller, very in-depth adjustments to the camera position/behaviour as well as a large choice of grafic options for the Unreal Engine 3.
Textures are very detailed, particle effects very well made. The grass on the ground is fantastically animated. Even though the arena/stadiums are the same, there are four different theme versions, ranging from a raining indoor park to a full blown stadium with thousand of people cheering.

The cars handle very well, can turn fast and stick to the ground unless you want and tell them to drift. Once airborne keeping the control of the car or wanting to do what you want is difficult but not impossible. The physic engine of the game does it's work very well. The ball itself is predictable and doesn't behave random at all.

You unlock new parts for your car customization after completing each game - no matter the outcome of the match. The account progress is ok, but nothing incredible or important. This game shines when it comes to it's gameplay.

The sound effects as well as grafical effects while playing or just driving around are incredible enjoyable. Boosting to full speed makes you feel powerful, ramming people and even destroying them creates satisfing explosions. And when scoring a goal the ball explodes and creates a shockwave on which you can ride on with your rocket launcher. Directly afterwards you get a replay of the goal in slow motion. At the end of the game you can save a replay of the entire game and watch it whenever you want.
Setting up goals and blocking the ball also feel rewarding by the system and on a team-spirit basis.

Since the game has high skill ceiling, experienced players can crush any other ones. The matchmaking system works very well in that regard, that you get matched up with equally good players and even indicates if it doesnt find them and slowly extends it's skill range in order to find players as fast as possible. You can group up to play together in normal and ranked games.
You also have the choice of selecting multiple regional servers such as Europe, Oceanic, West- and East-America, as well as queueing up for multiple modes (e.g. 1vs1 and 3v3) at the same time. The game will put you in the first fitting game it can find for you.

The game also provides a singleplayer campaign against the AI, as well as tutorials and training for various parts of the game such as defending the goal and scoring goals. For those who just want to get used to the controls or test can hop into the sandbox mode.
I also like to mention that you can queue up for an online game from any menu or singleplayer gamemode. So while searching you can play around in sandbox mode.


Downloadable Content (Supersonic Fury DLC Update)
As announced by Psyonix, the first major update hit Rocket League. I first was disappointed that they want to go the DLC route. Not because i dont like to pay for content, but more because of the bad reputation the word 'DLC' has nowadays, fearing that Rocket League gets looked down for doing this markt strategie. But my fear should vanish.

The first DLC just includes two new car and customization items for a small price. The real update includes free stuff for everyone. New map, new specator mode, better ranked play, improved main menu background, and so on. With the new update the 20€ i pay for the game are even more worth it. And Psyonix plans are to keep going, maybe even into the direction of modding and crazy maps.

So yes. I am excited for every upcomming Update and DLC.


Conclusion
I recommend this game to everyone. May it be casual players, those who play in a group to have fun together as well as the ones who like play competitively. Playing this game has the perfect fun/frustration balance and great learning curve."

												Let me get right to it. Rocket League is an amazingly addictive game with a lot of depth. Just when you thought you know how to play, other higher-level players will come and shatter that illusion. It also feels amazing seeing players pull off amazing moves, and then after several matches you try looking badass, failing each time, until it does work, and you get progressively better at it. It's a textbook ""easy to learn, hard to master"" kinda game in that regard. The controls are responsive, and it also looks amazing visually at max settings. But... why a negative review then? Hear me out, don't down-thumb like a sheep because I don't ""like it"". Because I do. I love Rocket League, my play time is proof of that. 

Then what is it? On the surface it's very simple, but deep beneath it's a very troubling issue: Psyonix has announced a crate system á la Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2. And as far as I'm concerned it's literally the worst timing to implement such a controversial system, with the recent outcry regarding the CSGOLotto-gate and the two little sh*ts Martin and Syndicate, as well as Valve's involvement in all this (going as far as ""advising and consulting"" these shady websites). Psyonix was - and to a certain extent still is - a developer that I hold highly because of their pro-consumer attitude with a lot of effort put into free post-launch content. To keep affording their contributions, they already sold DLC with new cars and other cosmetic items, but I didn't mind. Why didn't I mind? Because you already knew what you'd buy, it's not a surprise. You can spend the 2$ on a DLC pack and know exactly what you'll get. 

But with this new upcoming system, it's literally going to be a lottery. And I know what you're thinking, ""lol he uses the word literally wrong"". No, I mean it. It's literally a lottery. To make matters worse, while regular gambling is regulated at a minimum age of 18, even children can play Rocket League. Crates will be dropped ""free"" randomly during regular gameplay, but you can only open that crate if you buy a key. Which essentially means it's literally gambling: you never know what's in a crate unless you spend the money on a key to open it. Maybe it's a great and rare item, maybe it's a duplicate you already have dozens of. And to top it all off, you won't even be able to sell your items on the Steam Community Market. ""We don't want it to make prone to exploitations"", they say. But that's bullcrap, it's only because of the console versions that they won't - or can't - implement a selling system. So what happens when you've spent money on this lottery only to have many duplicates? Who knows, probably you could just use the current trading menu with five items of a certain class that convert to one item of a higher class.

This is not just about you. This is also not just about disabling the crate system and just playing the game as we used to. This is about a morally grey system that can take advantage of vulnerable people for uncreative, greedy financial benefit. And I don't want to take part in this, and neither should you. But I expect thumbs down and ignorant comments."

Simple, cute & fun football game.
It's more difficult than you think if you just watch streamers playing it.

												The idea is simple. soccer with rc cars that can propell themselves with rockets as boost. Why is it simple ideas with small twists work so flawlessy.

The only negative things about this game are:

- number of arenas is small and same(Would love to see one in the shape of a U/S/N with goals on each end point
- no custom elements for modes other than ranked and number of people (time, score limit, how much boost the pads give, even options on how the ball acts would be nice, etc) 
- get or have a game pad (good luck if you dont)
- prepare to have no life

Positives

- a lot of customization for a $20 game
- purely skill based (nothing in game can give you an edge (other than keyboard/mouse vs gampad)
- With pc and ps4 gamers togeather its a very big player pool for such a small game
- Rocket trails 
- can pick up and play or go for hours on end
- Looks realy good and the style of the game realy fits togeather 
- NOT FTP and NOT riddled with microtransactions (part of the reason why the game is as good as it is)


Ill put is this way, If you even like the idea of soccer and playing the game as cars this is for you and their is much fun to be had 

 I love this game and its concept/execution"

- start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting him, I say the neighbour usually warns me first before calling the cops
- cop says it wasn't the downstairs neighbour who called, but the one in the BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET
- almost start laughing
- cop asks WTF was I doing
- start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting him again
- he asks why I have the window open
- say I totally forgot
- he asks: ""What game are you playing?""
- he knows.
- I ask: ""Is that a serious question?""
- he says: ""Don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t me, I've been a gamer for 15 years - what game?""

Why funny?
Cars playing soccer, it's self-explanatory.

Why fast?
After you have played ""just 5 matches"" during night, you see the sun rises in your window.

Why addictive?

												Well, i'm sure my hours (5000+ as of now...send help) speak for my testimony when I say: this game is perfect.

I've had a hard time finding a game to sink my time into in the past due to story conflicts and other issues. As for Rocket League? It's simple, it's well made, and it's a blast.

The five minute rounds offer an ADHD filled event of rocket powered cars soaring through the air, slamming into one another, and explosive balls when you score! You can save replays to go back and watch your impressive goals, or to make beautiful videos. Different roles await: do you fancy yourself as the dashing striker who brings your team to victory? Or perhaps the demolition expert  who pushes your rivals to the breaking point and opens up opportunites to score? Or even the goalie, denying the enemy the sweet sweet taste of success. JUMP ON IN!

PROS:
-Full car cuztomization
-Rocket Powered Acrobatic Aerial Capabilities!
-Vibrant graphics
-Intuitive replay system
-1v1- 4v4 Online play
-2-4 Player split screen action!
-Season mode
-Ranked online!
-Demolition
-Training modes
-Kind and open Devs!
-Incoming DLC including maps from SARPBC!
-ONLY $20! (Free on PS4)

CONS:
-Slight lag spikes depending on region.
-There's people who don't have this game yet."

												If i could describe this game in a resumed way, I'd say that this is the type of games that you wonder why it hadn't been made earlier and at the same time you praise the fact that its developed in the best way it could have been developed; It revolutionates the sense of gaming.

There isn't enough to be said about this game: Its it's simplicity that really pulls the trigger on this game's gameplay. As of a competitive game, it is obvious that you will have hundreds, if not thousands of hours invested in this game. It is easy to learn, however hard to master. If you are scared of the cars having advantages and disavantages, dont be worried: they are purely aesthetic and has no influence on gameplay. And it also combines the fact that its a great game, both for bringing your friends together for marathons of laughs and for marathons of competitiveness.]

If i can describe it competitively i would say its like you are having shots of competitiveness and fun; it's games are only 5 minutes long (longer if eventually the team ties up and the game has to end with any of the teams scoring the tiebreaker) and are incredible tense and fast paced. You will find yourself amazed by some of the plays made here and the sense of physics is well ported onto here.

There are its flaws, however: The game does bring a certain ammount of questions whether it has enough items to be unlocked or not, as you will find yourself unlocking all of the game's content in a matter of hours, there are some server issues from time to time (minimal most of the time though) and there is the issue of not being able to have car customizable slots, where you'll find yourself having to customize your car to scratch if you ever change its model; all things that can be fixed throughout the updates and the dev that I gained my trust on from the time i played this game.

In general, its a great add-up to your library that will fill hours of your life, that, in my opinion, were not wasted on.

												You think you don't like games with simple ideas and gameplay? Think again.
You think you are too good to drive toy cars and hit balls with them? Think again.
You think you are too much of an ""Intellectual Gamer"" to play this simple game? Think again.

You think you have friends? Think again.
You think you have time for your family? Think again.
You think you have time to study? Think again.

If your parents don't know or fully understand the concept of not being able to pause an online game, then I have some bad news for you.

Seriusly, can a game be flawless? F**k yeah it can! From the gameplay to the soundtrack, you will love every bit of this game. Rocket league is also one of the very few games to be an officially sponsored E-sport shortly after it's release.

Solid 10/10."

This game is extremely fun and addicting.
Great, responsive and fluid controls,
Beautiful art style and visuals,
Great sound design,
Great and somewhat in depth customization to give your car a bit of flavour,
No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t microtransactions. Yep, that's right, you actually have to earn everything in this game (crazy right?)
Oh, and not to mention hours upon hours of fun.
Although, if you (like me) play for a long time, it starts to become extrememly repetitive, but what game isn't?

I highly recommend this game, it is most definately worth your money and your time."

												If you and some friends are looking for something fun and light-weight to mess around with this summer while waiting for fall releases, Rocket League should prove a worthy candidate. Playing with random strangers or with AI provides a significantly less enjoyable experience as it is the camaraderie and “oh man, did you see that!” moments that elevate the game above its simple premise. The promise of free content updates and the highly active community are further incentives to join the fun, though the staying power of the game is something that will be revealed only with time.

The learning curve is very fair and it is easy to get decent at it. Once you do learn it, there is no cap to how good you can get at it. The sky is litterally the limit here!

												I love this game!  Soccer/Football in RC cars with jets strapped to their back and an exploding ball.  The controls are tight, the action intense and it's a pulse pounding thrill ride even when you lose.

Don't get me wrong, just like with real soccer/football it's easy to play but difficult to play well.  But the training gives you the tools, you just need to practice. Highly recommended for anyone who likes action packed games with high speed thrills and crazy crashes.  

Remember when you were a kid and you were practicing catching high fly balls?  How you had to practice getting under it and timing it just right?  Get ready for that with jet cars."

												Okay, okay. Yes, I still exist. I meant to post this review earlier but I couldn't due to some technical issues.


Let me put this out here: I'm not a soccer fan. Probably because I'm an American (despite my name) but I just never got into it. I played it when I was three and quit before our first game, so I was never big on it. But then I was introduced to Rocket League. At first, I didn't care too much for it. Eventually, however, I soon realized I was missing out. When I was on the verge of buying it, my awesome friend Cyroden bought the game for me at the most convenient time. After playing it when I had my opportunities, I'm ready to give an opinion on it.

Graphics
The game is gorgeous. Very gorgeous at that. Compared to other ""sports"" games, this one stands out. Everything is incredibly detailed and is high quality compared to the other potatoes we've gotten in the past few years. Not to mention, this game comes with a replay feature, and with it, if used properly, you can make some incredible screenshots. I don't have any issues with anything here.

Gameplay 
This is the core of the game. If this is bad, then it's not worth buying the game. But I gave this game a thumbs-up, so you know what I'm going to say. Everything is very smooth and flopping around in a car is just flat out awesome. It's a simple concept but it has a learning curve that's quite time consuming to master. I would highly recommend a controller to ease the suffering a little bit, but it's not that necessary. It's still playable with the keyboard and mouse. Getting adjusted to the controls can take a bit of time, because I first mixed jumping and toggling the ball camera up, and it didn't turn out so well. Some of the controls do seem questionable, even after I converted to controller with this game. However, it isn't too rough and you should manage to get the hang of it within a couple of hours. Also, if you're a dude who loves creating stuff (like myself) then praise the devs of this game for adding a car editor here. There's also no pay-to-win techniques or anything here, you can get every single item in the game without spending a dime, and there's no way you can pay for the items anyway. Everything is unlockable, and the editor is simple to use. Would I add some more to it? Yes. But it's so rare to find any kind of simplistic editors these days I'm already thankful there's one in this game.

Story
There's no story, it's just a multiplayer game meant to be fun, this won't be counted towards the final score.

Audio
This one is going to be short and sweet as it doesn't really matter all that much in this situation. The music fits and some of the tunes can be catchy, and the audio is pretty solid as well. There are no major flaws, but there's nothing to drool over here.

Replayability
Of course, this is the debatable one here. I didn't get hopelessly addicted to it, but I still really enjoy this game. My one problem, and it's probably the biggest issue I have with the game, is the fact that it seems heavily reliant on having friends play with you. I had friends to play this game, and when I played with them, it made a significant difference in the fun factor of the game. I would've played a lot more of this if it wasn't for the fact it's not as fun if you're playing alone. But, it does excel in the fact that it's a fun game to play with friends so I'd recommend trying to find some out in the wild.

Verdict
Rocket League is flat out fun. Yes, it's flawed, but it's still an excellent title to play if you've got some friends, a controller (preferably) and a free night where you've got nothing to do. Finally, a game that had a clean PC release and didn't try and drain your money!

												No more than two minutes (maybe even one) since you opened the game and you're already looking at the ball, waiting for the countdown to finish, your little radio-controlled engine revving up, not knowing what your opponent will try, not knowing if your teammates are aware of what YOU will try. The countdown is over and two cars (or four, or six, or eight) lunge at the ball, all those colored and crazy boost trails converging at the center, a single thump, a mess of antennae, cars flying all over the place, the ball going up and away and everyone scrambles to send it to the opponent's side of the field. You zig-zag around, you and your team hitting your best shots, the opponent hitting their best saves, until finally a small mistake and you score. Or get scored.

The replay kicks in, you relax a bit and realize something: It's been 15 seconds since the game started.


Nostalgic in its simplicity, more than modern in its presentation, Rocket League is like Fifa Street meets Re-Volt with extra rockets. A game that wants you to get in and get flying as soon as possible and keeps you playing not with shady design decisions but with pure and fast competitive action. An amazing reminder that sometimes less is much better. Worth the full price or even more if you ask me.

Oh, and last but not least: hats for your cars."

												This game is as addicting as FIFA soccer is. I do however recommend it with prudence. This game is action packed but can be seen simplistic by a few.

I've played the game back in alpha and didn't much care for it. I like it now more than previously, which is an extremely good thing.

Rocket league is a soccer game played with RC cars. Obviously, the goal is to get the ball into the opponents net. Cars are given a few abilities to mix up the game. They can easily scale and drive on walls, and even up side down on the roof for a period of time (or longer with enough turbo). Boost or turbo is another feature in game. To acquire turbo, players must drive over small hot spots spread throughout the terrain. Some hot spots give minor turbo boosts while others will fill up the gauge all the way. Boosts when timed correctly, can produce a power hit on the ball. Some boosts when held down for a certain amount of time engage in some sort of ultra speed. When going this fast and if a player is in your way, you have the ability to literally run through and destroy the opponent. 

I am a huge fan of games which feature double jump, and rocket league has it! The first jump is a bit of a slow jump, while the second provides for another boost upwards, forwards, to the side or in reverse. While in the air, the player has quite a bit of flexibility to move about. This trick comes in hand when attempting to defend or attempting to knock the ball in an awkward angle. It can look pretty cool when done right. There are no power-ups within the games so this fact alone may turn a few people away from the game... this is only of course if you play competitive. Non-competitive games feature power-ups. None the less, the devs took a simplistic approach to keep the game engaging. The matchmaking that is available is organized very neatly and local co-op is an extremely appreciated feature. Matchmaking is a bit funny to me in the sense where if only four players are available, it will add two AI's instead of allowing for a 2v2 vote. Again, it's not a big deal as empty slots are filled up with AI's (sometimes extremely annoying AI's that score on themselves). This however only applies in non-competitive mode which for the most part is ok. A neat feature is there is an arrow that indicates where the ball is off screen. Additionally, there is a circle marker on the ball to show where and how far up in the air is the ball. Players can press Y to change the camera view off the car and toward the ball. The player can also choose to toggle the lock button for the camera.

Graphics are well done and nothing seems cut short. You can optimize for performance or quality (whoot whoot)! There are different stages in the game but they are limited (or I should say were limited). A few more ""out of this world"" stages have been added for free which is greatly appreciated. The customizations regarding the cars are absolutely well done. From custom paint jobs, custom wheels, to even custom hats (that for some weird reason keep your goal count). My only complaint if I can have one is the DLC purchases for new car skins... but hey, who am I to judge. The menu's and the UI was also well done and everything is kept simple and neat. The music and sounds in game have improved since it's start. I love how different boosts all have a different sound and some even play music. This is really paying attention to detail. The sound tracks in general are pretty catchy. That could be part in fact I've also heard them numerous times.

The game is quite exciting and cars seemingly fly everywhere. It's enjoyable when everyone crashes into the ball, but it is even more delightful when people start calculating hits and play positions.

For future Rocket League DLC's or games, it would be nice to see some mini-games! The main part of the game is excellent, but imagine adding some modifications to it. Perhaps adding power-ups could give an alternative to matchmaking.

Overall good game, and I would recommend it to most people. There are a few friends that are reluctant to get into it, but for the most part it has received positive reception.

***Dec 2016 update : there are new game modes that involve other sports such as hockey or basket ball. I think this is a neat step as it creates many new opportunities. They are not available in competitive mode, but are still very fun to play. You're essentially a flying projectile whenever you wish. When you get the hang of flying, this game's opportunities start flying wide open. Very simplistic game but you can definitely see the skill range of some players is phenomenal. Unlike FIFA where you would get discouraged, I'm sure you'll start challenging yourself when you see some of these crayz stunts.

RATING : 8.1/10

												Rocket League is a Football(Soccer) inspired sports game made by Psyonix. In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Football(Soccer) with cars. It might be the best game I've played this year so far.

There are a few different game modes, including online, Exhibition where you play against bots or your friends in local play, and a season mode where you play as a member on a team and you try and complete a season and win the championship. The game modes are fun, but not very different from each other. I do wish the Season mode was more like a Franchise mode in something like Madden, being able to control all the little things of your team, and having more stat tracking would make it a lot better, but its still worth a play or two.

The gameplay in this game is perfect. Once you figure out the flow to your car, how to use boosting properly, and how to track the ball, you'll realize just how addicing the game can be. Against bots or online, the game shines in its fun and addicting gameplay that adds a unique twist on the game of Football(Soccer). Learning the game comes quick, but mastering the techniques could easily take 30-50 hours of gameplay. 

You have a large selection of cars and different things you can design them with. The speed and hitboxes are pretty much the same, so there isn't an optimal car to use, which is a great thing. All the different customization is basically cosmetic that does some minor stat tracking. I'm really happy they went this route, because you don't feel obligated to build your car based on some kind of metagame, you can customize it however you like it. 

Besides the season mode being kind of lacking, the only other complaint I had(notice, had), was the online. The first day I had it I couldn't play online at all, it just didn't work, and apparently until Saturday the online was pretty much broken. Thankfully, its been pretty much fixed, but I thought it would be an important point to mention. It is good that the developers showed commitment and actually fixed the problem, though.

Rocket League is an amazing game with addictive gameplay. I don't really get the people that say they don't like sports games, a lot of the gameplay and stat tracking in them is great, and this game is no exception. If your looking for a game to play with friends, or even by yourself that is very competitive based, or even if your just bored and looking for a game to risk $20 on, Give Rocket League a shot, its one of the best games to come out this year. 

Pros:
-Strong gameplay
-Easy to learn, hard to master 
-Plenty of car customization
-No car building meta, you can customize without worry
-Encoranges teamwork
-Reasonable asking price($20)

Cons:
-Lacking season mode could use more stat tracking and player control

												I couldn't recommend this game any more if I tried. Buy this game right now. You will never regret it.

This is one of the most entertaining, fun, and addictive games I've ever played. Just like its predecessor, this game provides hours upon hours of entertainment. The physics are superb, the gameplay is easy to pick up and thrilling to master, and it looks beautiful. It's a game that definitely gets better as you improve, which makes it more and more fun as you play it. There's something extremely addicitve about playing football/soccer with cars, and with the addition of boost, acrobatics, and flying, it just never stops being fun. It's one of those games where you always say ""one more game"" over and over again. There's plenty of different gamemodes to play, including season mode, drill training, online ranked, unranked, private, split-screen, split-screen online, and a bunch more. 

Pros:
    The game looks beautiful
    The physics are spot on, so the game relies entirely on your own skill, with no automatic passing and shooting. You're on your own, which makes making saves and scoring goals so much more satisfying.
    It's so addictive...like really addictive...like ""oh my god is it 5am already?"" addictive.
    It's incredibly well optimised, as evident by the generous system requirements. You don't need a fantastic PC to play this game on high settings, but it still looks and plays beautifully at 60fps with not-as-good PCs
    There is a bunch of customisation features, including body types, skins, hats, boost trails, tires, and whatnot.
    Rank-based matchmaking, so you actually play people of similar ability, rather than being bored getting thrashed or thrashing other players
    There's cross-play with PS4 users
    It's a fantastic party game to play with your friends on split-screen, or online
    The gameplay is flawless, making it really easy for new players to pick up, but allowing for an insanely high skill ceiling where the top players can really pull of some amazing skills
Cons:
    It will ruin other aspects of your life, such as your social life and work life with its addictiveness.

Amazingly fun game to play but even more fun, to me, is watching pros like Dirkend, Law, Tree, Kronovi, Gibbs, and sorry if I missed anyone that streamed beta/preview and actually has shown what are the game's possibilities. With that being said, I think and really hope that this game will become one of next E-sports big things, it certainly would be lots of fun for the audience. 

I'll give it 10/10 for the game, rate a lot lower for community because people that are leaving games a lot, but hopefully that will get changed.

Definitely recommending it"

												This is the first game I've ever felt inclined to give a review on. I have to say it's probably one of my favorite multiplayer experiences ever. NO LAG on online multiplayer, great graphics but still very well optimized, and a fun community that simply loves the game. I'm not one to choose these kinds of indie competitive games but the gameplay at least had me wanting to use it as a local multiplayer game (yes, it can have up to 4-way splitscreen). However, after playing one match online I ended up playing for a few hours straight. 

I highly reccomend this game. Since it is new, the player base is fairly large (about 40,000 in matchmaking from 11pm to 2am) it will surely give you hours upon hours back on your money. 

10/10 Will binge play this until my fingers bleed.

P.S. I was playing this with a controller so I'm not sure how well the keyboard controls work for this."

												Intro:
Rocket League is a sequel to the less-known vehicular football video game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released in July 2015 for PC and PS4 and got a Xbox One version earlier this year. There are an OS X and Linux versions planned to be released this year. A lot of people (myself included) had never heard of SARPBC until they tried Rocket League out.


Base Concept:
The base concept for this game as simple as it gets: combine football with cars and try to defeat the opponent team. The idea sounds pretty simple and many would think that it will be easier to play than actual football games such as FIFA or PES. If you are one of those people, then you're suddenly mistaken.

The game is easy to understand but often you'll end up having to put effort into it in order to succeed. It is challenging and usually you will have to fly in air in order to get or shoot the ball. You are awarded XP points which are assigned to you after the end of every match. Those XP points are the ones that make you actually ""level up"" in the game. There are 2 different types of ranks: normal and competitive ones. Normal ones are gathered by levelling up while the competitive ranks are gathered by playing the competitive game modes.


Gameplay:
The game consists of a couple game modes: standard football ones, basketball (named Hoops) and the chaotic Rumble mode that features around 10 special items you can use to give yourself the advantage while your team has the possession of the ball. Due to the arenas being not as big as they are in real life, having 22 players chasing 1 ball would be, to say the least, too chaotic. For that sake, Psyonix decided to restrict teams to a maximum of four players per team.

Matches consisting of 1 to 3 cars are optimal ones while the ones featuring 4 cars per team are, although no less entertaining, reasonably marked as ""Chaos"". Then there are the Hoops and Rumble game modes, first of which is basically basketball combined with cars while the second one represents the already known combination of football and cars, this time with some special effects and items which can help you to score some goals.

The game surely is entertaining and even if you were never a fan of either football or racing, this game may take your interest. The game has some collision model problems (not really bugs, but just unoptimized car collisions) which can be noticed in goal replays. Sometimes, you can clearly see the ball flying away even though visually, you didn't actually hit it. That is not a very big problem, though, and it happens only when your car's front is supposed to hit the ball.

On the keyboard, the controls feel great and are just like you'd expect them to be. The game features boost pickups which you can use to temporarily speed up your car or for flying like a rocket (obviously representing the name of the game itself). Sadly, the matchmaking is not very optimized and from time to time, a ""semi-pro"" or a ""pro"" ranked player will have to play against an ""expert"" or even a ""master"". That is, of course, not fair.

Would be a bad thing to forget the car customization. While Rocket League doesn't support modding, you can customize your cars with tons of different body colors, wheels, trails, antennas and items to put on the top of your car (literally hats for cars).

Visuals:
Rocket League is running on the Unreal Engine 3. Its visuals are colorful and look simply beautiful. The arenas are filled with different colors (mostly the team colors) and some of them even have country flags hanging around them. All the arenas (excluding the rocket labs) have similar layouts and a pretty unique theme.

The 3D main menu is set in one of the arenas and you can rotate the camera to see different angles of your car which is very helpful especially when it comes to car customization. There are tons of different options that can improve the effects in-game or the actual game experience.


Verdict:
This game is a really awesome example of how an interesting combination of 2 totally different things with great execution can be strong and not require tons of features in order to get players return to it on a daily basis. With over 50K players on a daily basis, this game promises to bring you a lot of fun, excitement and even anger. It's one of those games that are really easy to learn and understand, but very difficult to master. If you do have some time and are looking for a way to burn hours in which you are bored, this is the right thing to go for.

The matchmaking needs optimization and there are some features (such as demolishing other players) that are very often (ab)used by other players for the sake of preventing you of defending or scoring, or how many people like to call it - dirty playing.

												I don't like soccer. I don't like cars. I love Rocket League!

Even with no interest whatsoever in the theme, I find Rocket League excellent as a game. Easy to learn, hard to master. It doesn’t start dull, it is fun right from the start as a beginner, and it only gets better as you improve.

It involves a very wide range of skills which gives the gameplay a lot of variety by constantly engaging your different abilities. I don’t mean variety as in different environments or doing different things, rather the variety applies to the ways in which the game demands your participation both physically (mechanical skills, accuracy, timing, consistency, …) and mentally (spatial awareness, intuition for the game’s physics like momentum or bounces, team coordination, …), pretty much like a real sport. This makes it one of the most fulfilling video games to play.

Rocket League is the video game that feels the closest to real life sports. It involves the same kind of skills and provides the same kind of fun. Absolutely recommended to everyone!"

												Let's get it out of the way: this may be the single best multiplayer game of recent years. Why, you may ask?

It's a simple enough concept but executed almost perfectly and then honed and polished to a shine. It's the very idea of ""easy to learn, hard to master"". The controls are intuitive and the mechanics so straightforward that you'll grasp them within minutes. And yet it will probably take you hundreds of hours to master all the intricacies of its systems. While beginner level games take place mostly on the ground, high level play gains a whole other vertical dimension and pro games are a spectacle to behold. And the best thing: it's a fun experience all along the way!

Psyonix also made a couple of sound decisions during its development: cross-platform play guarantees a large playerbase for the years to come, unlocked, dropped and bought items (there is a ""key & crate"" system in place) are cosmetic in nature only (no stat boosting) and the DLC cars handle the same (except turn radius) as every other car in the game and only differ in their hitbox. The camera settings are also completely customizable (FOV up to 110) to accommodate a wide range of playstyles.

Be aware that due to the nature of the game, competitive game modes can be a salt mine of gigantic proportions. Fortunately enough, Psyonix provide different filter settings for voice and text chat to make sure this game can even be enjoyed by adolescents (and me).

Highly recommended!"

												Rocket League > League of Legends
Rocket League is the best League

-----------------

A stranger once said to me, in response to the above statement:

""oh yeah, thats why in twitch you can see more than 200k viewers on lol and 50k on rocket""

To him, or any other who has similar remarks, I proclaim the following words:

""Greatness is not measured in viewer counts or player amounts.

Greatness, my friends, is measured in leagues""

Truth be told, there is no game that can compare to the glorious, magnificent experience that is Rocket League. 

This masterpiece is truly in a league of its own.

Furthermore, before any of you cast forth accusations upon me, I can assure you, I am not in league with those who developed this supreme, rocket-powered work of exquisitely coordinated, flashing pixels.

-----------------

Ok you know what? forget the formalities and proper grammar. Imma shoot straight with you. 

If you thought you could just buy the game and top the leaderboards in a day, you. thought. wrong.

The journey's gonna be harder than that trek from a toilet-paperless dump to that stack of extra rolls in your basement in the middle of the night with the lights out.

Most of the ppl you meet will be way out of your league, and its gonna take guts, practice, and a controller if you want to make it anywhere. 


So Stand Tall. Stand Proud.

So Sit Down. On Your Butt.

Idle In That Menu.

Listen To That Soundtrack.

Join That Game.

And Get Rekt Make That Ball Go Boom."

												This game is a jewel, the developers were able to mix a simple game with a very competitive background, the fun is guaranteed at short bursts of 5 minutes per gameplay, the more you play, the better you get at it, but it doesn't really matter because the matchmaking system really does it work, and puts you against people that has the same skill as you, being always a fair game (Except if a retard teammate decides to leave for no reason at the start of the game).

I find myself playing it daily, it doesn't make you have bad feelings like CS:GO does, for example (800 hours on record, and I'm sick of the game by now), if you were thinking about picking this game up, do it now, you are able to create a party with your friends and play ranked, where you get points via winning, and lose points via losing, in a simple yet smart way of categorizing players, unranked, where nothing really matters, or a private match, to mess around with boths or without bots, as I said before, fun guaranteed. This is my choice as game of the year.

Enjoy!

PS: When you're looking at the store page, you can't miss the DLCs being there, but don't start thinking about them as a stupid, greedy move made by the developers, the game is cheap, so are the DLCs, they just add cars (Every car is almost the same, they're totally balanced and equal), antennas, wheels, boost ""skins"", and other aesthetic stuff. They're not necessary in any way, but I'm buying them all to support the developers, and because they're worth the price."

												The proof  that a game doesn't need to be mechanically complex to be compelling. Rocket Leauge is as simple as video games get. But it's tweaked and polished to perfection, making every moment all kill and no fill. And when the game is at it's best moments, whether it be the tense stand offs when all the players rush for the ball at kickoff or 30 seconds left on the clock with a tied scoreboard. It can be genuinely hard to put down. It harks back to simpler times, when video games didn’t need a billion bells and whistles to keep players interested. They just needed great design, and that’s exactly what you get with Rocket League. Soccer with cars. And it's beautiful."

												For something as simple as soccer/football played with turbo-powered cars, Rocket League is way more in-depth and entertaining than it might appear on the surface. Fast-paced, clean-looking, and hard not to enjoy even when you're losing or making embarrassing mistakes, this game will give you plenty of moments where you're geeking out over some incredible shot, save, or block - and it will give you just as many moments of intense, stress-inducing close calls or just-barely-missed opportunities.

Played like a much smaller (player-wise) version of soccer/football - with several variations like 1 vs 1, 3 vs 3 (the standard), 4 vs 4, etc. - Rocket League is an interesting mix of competitive sports and driving/racing, pitting players against each other on two teams in five minute matches. An interesting twist, however, is the rocket-powered aspect of the cars and the ""boost"" fuel that players have to pick up and manage throughout the match. While it might seem like something strictly used for speed, it plays into essentially every aspect of the game, from controlling yourself in the air to making/blocking shots as well as to take other players out. With both resource management and getting a feel for how the cars control or the ball works, the game can feel very random and chaotic at first, often leaving you feeling like any play you make is chance or luck; to me, however, this is where Rocket League's longevity and replayability really comes into play. 

You might be clueless initially and have no idea what you're doing (yet still manage to make plays), but the game unfolds more and more as you play and get your bearings. While one match you're barely struggling to hit the ball in the air, soon enough you'll hit them every time and come to find that as you practice you have way more control over the game and yourself than the chaotic atmosphere might let on. The high-flying bounces, the impossible-to-save/strike shots - it all will eventually be something you can not only handle consistently, but also open you up to the other techniques in the game like aerial movement/shots and boost control.

Combine the solid gameplay and skill progression with an easy-to-use interface and good soundtrack (which should totally have an option to enable during matches!) and Rocket League is a surprisingly fun, easy-to-play but hard-to-master game that's both something you can pick up every now and then as well as play for hours."

												Absolutely amazing game. I really didn't expect this much fun when I first got it, but holy damn. I've never had this much instant fun in a game in a loooong time. I also don't think I've had this much adrenaline while playing a game ever. 

Absolutely amazing game design. Its extremely juicy; there are great effects and small touches that really, really add to the fun of the game. Everything you do feels satisfying and extremely responsive. Controls are very intuitive as well if you use a controller, such as Xbox or PS.

So deceptively simple, yet so insanely fun. Not much depth on the outside, but once you play you realize that there is a lot of depth, and a LOT of potential.

Easy to play, hard to master.

Buy this game. Now."

												This is a fantastic game, that has some major issued that need to be addressed. Ever since the september patch, things have took a turn for the worse. Horrible optomizations lead to framerate problems on even the most extensive of graphics cards, all of the servers are under extreme stress and lagspikes ruin most games now.

												Rocket League is a well-made mix between racing and soccer genre. If you are subscribed to any of gaming Youtube channels or websites, you are probably already familiar with the game and you know that there is quite a lot of hype about it. And that hype is not unjustified.
If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end. 

What is happening in the game:You are in control of a car and your mission is to score enough goals to win the match with other players. You can play multiplayer (with actual people) or singleplayer (with bots). Also, there is a freeplay mode for you to sharpen your skills.

Pros:    The way this game looks is astonishing. Grass, cars, turbo effects, the ball, the arena ... they really look good. I mean, look at the Store page screenshots!
    Multiple game modes for both online and offline playing (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4). Ranked cannot be 4v4, however. If you play on ""Unfair"" difficulty against bots, you can also play 1v2, 1v3 and 1v4.
    There is a tutorial in this game and unlike some other games, you can actually learn stuff from this one. For basic playing, there is a short tutorial just explaining how to move and jump, but if you have time and will to take your playing technique to the next level, this is taken care of by more advanced tutorials. This is probably one of rare games where you actually want to play tutorial multiple times.
    Car handling is near-perfect, it really goes where you want it to go. Also, you can drive one the walls, fly and even drive upside down on the arena ceiling for a short time.
    A very special thing in this game is so-called ""Ball View"", where camera is always pointing towards the camera. You can turn it on and off at appropriate times to maximize your efficiency while trying to hit the ball into opponents' net.
    Car customization content is absurd. You get hundreds of wheels, antennas, hats, car types ... you are guaranteed to find a combination that suits you.
    Next thing about car customization is how you unlock parts. This is the best way I've seen it handled: you get something for every single match you play. Yes, you've heard right. No matter what you play, with bots with real people, 1v1, you always get something.
    After playing every match, you also get a chance to save a replay of the game you have just played. These saved games can be then watched from perspectives of all players, there is also a free camera mode.
    Matchmaking seems to be working well, I've never been in a match that would be completely unfair or unbalanced.
    The soundtrack is amazing, it consists of 11 songs that are also available on Amazon[www.amazon.com] and iTunes[itunes.apple.com].
    You get XP even for playing with bots, but you get only 50% of you would get with playing online. Still, it's a great way to encourage people to play more. You also get some XP for losing.
    This thing runs great even on old computers and you don't even have to have all the setting set to low!
    The community is really active, there are almost five thousand threads created on Steam Discussions, there are tons of Youtube videos and streamers playing it.
Cons:    Only occasional lags when playing online. Also, sometimes servers are dead for a minute, but that only happened twice to me. Not a problem at all.
    There is PS4 support, but no Linux and MacOS? Come on!
The final verdict:With practically no bad sides and tons of good stuff in this game, I certainly recommend it to everyone, not just fans of soccer or racing. I'm not a big fan of either of them, but I enjoy this game a great deal. You can customize your car in more than 10 billion combinations, the game really encourages you to play and the feeling when you play is amazing. 
This is certainly one of the best games released this year. There are so many people playing all the time, there are streams, Youtube videos, tons of discussions, simply amazing. You can't be sure how long is this going to last for, so try grabbing it as soon as it gets any discount or even now, as it is certainly worth the full 20$ price tag.

												 An Amazing Sports GamePeople have plenty of misconceptions about this game. Its not simply soccer with cars.

Rocket League is an adrenaline-pumping, itch-feeding, finger-mashing, explosive sports game. It is the result of a great clusterball of imagination, vision and execution. You control a car, with rocket boosts that allow you to manouver in the air, jump and perform bicycle kicks. Unlike regular football fields, you are playing in a specially designed cages that allow you free movement. Since the fields are closed, the action runs seamlessly.

The biggest difference that derails from the old formula of sports game is the fact that you only control a single entity. You do not switch from one ragdoll to another to perform incredible feats. You communicate with one-another on an electric level that when executed perfectly sends chill down your spine. 

With insane avatars capable of withstanding the severest laws of gravity, the presence of each individual in the field matter. Not once or twice, the game countlessly put you in exhilarating situations akin to football strikers: preventing a tiebreaker from being scored during the last moments of the round or giving an impossible sommersault pass with the last sliver of nitros that leads to an impressive aerial goal by your teammate. 

Instead of placing features that exist in today's meta, Rocket League opted for a more traditional approach. You will find no such character progression, career mode or ability unlocks in this game. What will keep you playing will simply be the charm of performing stunning moves, outmanouvering and outsmarting your opponents over and over again, one game after another. 

It's just another 5 minutes after all...

Additional comments apart from Core Gameplay (+good / -bad)+ Wonderful aesthetics/colour palette
+ Amazing Soundtracks
+ Ability to practice while queueing
- Server Issues
- Matchmaking problems

												I'm going to keep this review short and sweet.

It's amazing, for the price, the specifications, it's all great. It's very easy to run on the highest settings, it doesn't require experience for you to pick up the basics and jump into the competetive side of this title, it's fun and enjoyable and very replayable.

You are given a customization item after every match (If you don't disconnect) which is awesome as it makes you want to play more!

You can play: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and my favourite, 4v4.

Seriously, buy this game, you don't need to like Football (Soccer) to enjoy this game. It's just fun.

9/10.

Con: The servers are slightly laggy at times, but i'm sure this will be looked upon."

												Rocket League is a fun mixup of a sports game and an arcade game. You can play either 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, the ranked varients of those matches, or the seasonal extra sport, which currently is Basketball. There are pads around the arena that give you boost so you can catch up to your opponents much quicker.

~Pros~
1.) Wide-spread Vechical Customizations, From Colors To Even Hats
2.) Easy To Learn Controls That Can Be Rebinded To Suit Your Play
3.) Rapidly Growing Competitive Scene, Now Spreading Into ESL Leagues

~Cons~
1.) Although The Controls Are Easy To Learn, They Are Very Hard To Master
2.) Teammates Will Almost Always Blame The Other Teams Goal On You, And Take Credit For All Of Your Goals

Thats about all I can think of right now, hope you all enjoy this game, highly recommended."

												I play this too much.

I'm sure you've already heard numerous great things about this game. I can definitely agree to them. This game screams fun regardless of if you've played 1 hour or 1000 hours. Even if you're losing, you find yourself having fun. And that's the mark of a seriously great game, in my eyes.

Rocket League can be played casually or competitively, boasting both unranked and ranked queues. It is a simple enough concept that people are already familiar with even before playing their first game (it's damn soccer dude, if you don't know you've been living under a rock very far away from Europe, possibly on the moon Europa). But then, it has such an incredibly high skillcap. You'd probably still be learning new manouevres and the like well into 2000 hours (give it time though).

I don't play with a controller as I don't own one, but I know that 99% of people recommend controller over keyboard/mouse. And from an unbiased standpoint, I would agree, as the analogs make ball control and fine movement much easier than WASD or the like. Regardless, if you do choose to play keyboard like a dummie (read: like me), then consider making a custom bind that doesn't use the mouse.

I could go on and on. But I'll let the game do the talking; go buy it. Believe me, for $20, this is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing steal. Best $20 I ever spent tbh.

10/10 would play again (actually am playing as I write this)

												 TL;DR in the end of the review!
I never had this much fun slamming balls into a big goal in front of me... this is Pu$$...

Oh wait... wrong review...

Erhm, rhm... Rocket League. Okay, what to say about it? 

Well, for one, it's the pure definition of a competitive video game: it's easy to learn and takes a lifetime to master.
I need, however to adress one thing that will put MANY people off: and that is the mix of genres it seems to have, and that is its mix of football and driving...

However:

 I have no hesitation in recommending this game at all, including for people that do not like racing, football or both, simply because it doesn't belong to any of such genres and as such, the problems you have with those genres/games, you simply won't have here.:

- The slow paced gameplay of football, filled with tactics, rules, free kicks, offsides, penalties, yellow and red cards, etc. etc. is COMPLETELY GONE! You can use ur nitro and completely obliterate the opposite team without any repercussions. The only thing football related here is that there's a ball (which is a bomb) and you need to put it in the opponent's goal (which will trigger the ball to explode).

- And the same applies to the racing component: there are no pre-determined paths, no speed limits, no linearity, crashing won't penalize you all that much and the vertical limitations are gone as you can fly, jump, wall jump and basically do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want (which I will mention a bit further below in this review)!

To put it in a more adequate analogy... I guess I can call it the Quake of sports games  as it clearly takes ideas from the Arena FPS genre, which is where Psyonix (the devs) got a name with their big hit Unreal Tournament 2004 (alongside Epic and DE). 

It allows a very engaging mix of football and cars. The devs could make a very plain car football game and that would be it. But they didn't do just that, did they?

Well, ♥♥♥♥ NO! You can jump, double jump, dash forward, to the sides or even dash backwards, do bycicle kicks, drive on the walls, jump from those walls and fly across the whole map, boost around and so much else! 

It will take you dozens of hours to master each technique properly and it helps that there is  ZERO RNG or stat based gameplay in the game!!: the cars all perform the same  except in 2 clear aspects: hitboxes (The big Van-like car has a much shorter but taller hitbox than the Dominus muscle car) and drifts/handbrake use. I am using my XBOX360 controller ( which I recommend, though keyboard is VERY intuitive as well ) with customized controls to my liking, where B is the handbrake. With, for example, the Takumi or the Breakout, you can do 180's MUCH more easily than with the Van-like car (I don't know the name of the Van, because I actually don't use it at all :p).

GRAPHICS
The graphics are absolutely excellent! Grass looks quite impressive, the bloom and shaders are stunning and give the game a very well needed sense of ""immersion"" that you are in an actual stadium!
The game can run on pretty much any PC (granted, you may need to tweak it a bit on weaker PC's, of course) but when maxed out, it's a joy to both look at and play. There's AN FOV SLIDER!!!!! And many more camera options, graphics options are immense as well and can help you tweak the game to your liking (♥♥♥♥ motion blur).

AUDIO
Audio consist of 2 big elements: Menu soundtrack and In-Game effects.

The soundtrack in this game is absolutely awesome! Easily one of the best I've heard the past decade. It makes you hum and bobble your head around with the cool pop tunes.

Sound effects are good, but good only. The car engines sound quite ""meh"", but the ball exploding, the sounds the stadium produce when a goal is scored (which are, btw, all different: Every stadium has it's own sound props, which is a very welcome attention to detail) are all very well done. There are lots of different boost trace skins (which I'll adress later) and each make their own sounds, which is, AGAIN, a very nice and welcome attention to detail.

GAMEPLAYBesides all the cool moves I listed above I must say the physics in this game are the best I've seen in, probably, ever! I am not even kidding...

The game has the same mode (just score the most goals after 5 mins) but there are 4 playlists: 1v1 Duel, 2v2 Duos, 3v3 Standard and the 4v4 Chaos mode (and I can confirm it's chaotic as f*ck!).

While there are no different modes... I can say that every playlist has it's own skill to be met. 1v1 requires a more balanced attack and defensive mindset,  2v2 is pure teamwork, 3v3 is a bit more chaotic  and there is space for a full 100% striker and a full-time 100% goalkeeper as well (even though it's not recommended: everyone needs to have a more mixed role, though a more attacking player and a more defensive player ARE CRUCIAL!) and 4v4 takes skill but I play it (as most probably do as well) just for the fun :D

EXTRAS / CONTENT IN GENERAL
There is a spectator mode and an offline season mode, the latter is barebones at best and serves no purpose, only to practise against bots and collect some achievements.

There are 150 customization items for your cars, if I'm not mistaken. These involve Hats, Antennas, Boost trace skins (like a basic nitrous skin, a flamethrower skin, purple smoke, blue data-streams, rainbows (my favorite :D), etc. etc.), paint jobs, materials for the car (you can have cars made of carbon fiber, gloss, metal, etc., very GRID 2-esque, which I really like), overall:

It's nearly impossible to find a player with the exact same car as you.

You can save replays of your game to watch them later or brag to your friends about that amazing long shot or impossible save you managed to pull off successfully.

There a tutorial system that is VERY HELPFUL to noobs but later grows into ridiculously difficult saves and shots that are there to make you see how well you have mastered the game's mechanics (timing is very crucial in any save/shot you take and most of all... power of antecipation... kinda like the Quake multiplayer... eh... see why I called it the Quake of sports now? Well there you go...). 

There is a ranked mode and leaderboards. There is also an unbelievable amount of stats, like ""How many goals did you score with this hat?"", ""How many kilometers with this set of wheels?"" or ""How many saves did you do with this paintjob?"", which add alot to a very entertaining package that takes dozens, if not hundreds of hours for you to get bored with.

Oh and there's crossplatform play with PS4 players (which from my experience, most tend to suck).

TL;DR and CONS
Alright, let's re-arrange it all with a basic PROS (+) / CONS (-) system since you lazy ""I hate reading"" ♥♥♥♥s love it so much :)

+ Great and enourmous ammounts of customization;
+ Takes lots of skill to be good at it;
+ Beautifu Graphics;
+ Phenomenal Soundtrack
+ Formidable Physics
+ Huge amounts of replayability
+ Crossplatform play with PS4
+ Some lucky shots, saves and nail-biting close matches will be some of funniest and most satisfying moments in your gaming life, respectively;
+ Formidable sense of growth with every match. You don't gain anything, no guns and none of that ♥♥♥♥. But you gain the most important thing that 95% of today's modern games don't offer: YOU GAIN SKILL! (Shocker, I know, most of you probably haven't heard of this word at all :p)
+ Adequate even for non-football and non-racing fans as it has nearly nothing in common with those genres.

- Server issues at launch (now fixed)
- Barebones and pointless single player season mode (MP season mode would be cool, though)

Overall, I recommend this game to literally everyone that enjoys video games."

												This is one of those games that grabbed my attention.  I saw it on the front page of Steam and decided to give it a go.  I had some work to do one fair evening but I wanted to do a little game first.  I played one round and was absolutley terrible.  I had to get better!  So I tried again, and again, and again, and again, and again.  Now 4 hours later I haven't got any work done.  Thanks Rocket League.

Seriously though, this game is ADDICTING.   The controls are super tight on an Xbox 360 controller.  Every precise movement counts when going for a goal.  Easy game to pick up but has a very high skill ceiling.  Honestly, I can see this becoming an eSport.  It is that competitve."

Whoever came up with this idea deserves a freakin cookie.  The game is beautiful, the gameplay is perfect, the community is active and generally pretty fun, and the soundtrack is awesome.  You can customize your cars which is always fun.  Also, cross-platform multiplayer!  PC players and PS4 players all play together, which is always a nice feature.  

10/10 would drive up the arena wall and jump off to aerial ""kick"" the ball into the goal again."

												Rocket League is one of the best games of 2015. It's stupidly fun, incredibly polished, and has a ridiculously high skill cap. There is nothing more satisfying than getting an aerial goal from across the field, and even playing defense is fun and involves a lot of mind games. The crossplay with PS4 is spot-on and I've never had to wait more than 20-25 seconds to find a ranked match. Playing well requires a lot of teamwork and coordination so if you have friends who play this game it's even better.

												- Went into a 1v1 ranked match
- I won the kickoff
- *controller turns off for no reason*
- I write in the chat: ""My controller isn't working""
- The enemy waits
- I get my controller working again
- We continue

People are nice


Now, the actual game



Pros:
- Nice graphics
- Really good physics
- Fun with friends
- Easy to learn, hard to master
- Mutators settings (really fun to mess around with.. You can adjust the ball size, the boost amount, change the ball to a puck etc.)
- The maps are cool 
- Doesn't require a really high specs computer
- Rumble mode is really fun for casual players


Cons:
- You haven't bought the game yet"

												Rocket League is one of those rare games that oozes love from its developers. 

You will sink hours into this game there is no escaping that. With an amazing multiplayer mode that includes split screen (something sorely missing from too many games today)  that you can take online. Great controls , superb physics . and an additive season mode this game is well worth the $20.

												HOTSHOT my friend already gave a fantastic review, so I will talk about one very important aspect to decide before buying the game:

Keyboards vs. Controllers
I never had to use a gamepad, okay sometimes I did for 2-player sessions on the same computer, but apart from that, this is the first time where I had to realize, controllers do give you the edge. And you need it if you don't want to uninstall the game after seeing others performing stunts practically impossible with the keyboard.

In a very fast-paced game like RL keyboard handling can easily turn out sub-par, as the followings are difficult to do:

Problems with keyboards
* Precision turning in a very short amount of time. Keyboard is not analog, so you have 2 choices: hold A/D/W/S and release when done, or tap those buttons in a rapid succession. You will find that you are going to be slower than guys with controllers.
* Acceleration and aerial turning forward is bound to the same key (W), so you would have to release W before flying in the desired direction. But, it is just too easy to forget, and you might end up forward flipping.

Not all controllers are supported!
This is one annoying feature, but after realizing that I would never become pro with a keyboard, I thought I could just dust off my old gamepad that I used to play NHL/FIFA/Mortal Kombat/NFS games with, but no, RL didn't even bother telling a message to me that, ""no I will just ignore your ***** controller!""

So you will need either an Xbox 360 controller for PC (either wired or wireless, doesn't matter, as long as it is for PC you will get a suitable USB cable with it), or what is better: an Xbox One controller for PC. Why better? People say the sticks feel better, so you will feel them easier to handle.

Oh yeah and PS controllers might work too but they aren't as convenient.

Will I need to install a driver?
No, at least on Windows 10 it's like plug and play.

How the controller works in the game
If you never had an Xbox controller like me, first thing to notice as a difference from regular controllers is that it has only 2 front buttons, rather than 4, and they will work like this:

Front right button: acceleration
Front left button: breaking / going backwards
Top left stick: turning (on ground and aerial)
A: jumping / pressing accept buttons in dialogs
B: nitro boost
X: drifting
Y: changing camera mode / pressing cancel buttons
Top right stick: camera angle
D-pad: navigation in the menu
Hardest parts are getting used to:

Accelerating and going backwards with the buttons on the front
Acceleration + nitro boosting + forward flipping at the same time (note: actually with nitro no need to accelerate)
Not accidentally hitting the jump button when you want to use the nitro boost.
Conclusion
At first it will be very hard to get used to the controller, it's like learning the game again, I actually went through the tutorials again, it felt really dumb. But keep practicing, because in the end I am pretty sure you will beat the guys using a keyboard having the same skill level as you."

												You first spend 20 hours chasing the ball and learning how to hit it while get used to the ball camera.
Then 200 hours to feel confident soaring in the air, by 500 hours you know how to hit specific angles and use the handbreak to be even faster.
All this depth in a 5 minute game of football with cars.

												This game is without any doubts one of my favorite games ever played, I'm playing it since it was released and I enjoyed every second of it with my friends but in the last few months competitive mode has been completely ruined, probably by the last patch. As soon as you play private games with your friends this game is pure FUN for hours, but if you ever want to take a break like trying a 1v1 competitive match, your fun will end there. In the first match, if you are veteran, probably you will find a semi-pro that you will just overwhelm 3-0 after 10 seconds and he will forfeit. In the second match (talking as a veteran) you will surely find a legend or so with at least 400+ hours than you and of course you'll never be able to win.
This game just needs improvements on the matchmaking, then it will be just perfect, but as it is now I can't recommend it to everyone."

												Rocket league is a fun game to play with friends online as a team and get some goals or saves.
Cant wait for later updates

Updated Review:
Game is still fun to play and im getting better at the game 1 step at a time. Connections to the server is good at 90ms ping but sometimes goes over 300ms which makes it a little hard to play but still playable.

I reccomend this to anyone who likes cars and soccer. Its reccomened to use a controller but i use both keyboard and controller. Its best to play with friends so you can have a better team that you can talk to using a mic. I will be recording this sometime to upload to youtube :D

In conclusion i give this game a thumbs up 

Edit: i have bought all the dlcs so far and they are all worth buying if you got spare money 

P.S: if you found this review helpful give it a thumbs up so otthers can see this review :P

This is still an amazing game"

+ great gameplay
+ great but difficult controls
+ very good graphics
+ beginner (&expert) friendly
+ pure real skills (no skill-tree)
+ no referre
+ no fouls
+ no ""wrong"" decisions
=> must play on tv & with firends (local&online)

Cons:
- no penalty 
=> at least the option; e.g. instead of an overtime
- no points for touching/dribbling/flanking the ball
""I really wish to see more game modes (e.g. ""MarioKartSoccer"") and the option to create Ur own decals.""

												Rocket League is one of the best games of 2015. It's stupidly fun, incredibly polished, and has a ridiculously high skill cap. There is nothing more satisfying than getting an aerial goal from across the field, and even playing defense is fun and involves a lot of mind games. The crossplay with PS4 is spot-on and I've never had to wait more than 20-25 seconds to find a ranked match. Playing well requires a lot of teamwork and coordination so if you have friends who play this game it's even better.

												Rocket League is basically football (Soccer) with a car BUT WAIT.... The cars are supersonic, they're acrobatic, they're rocket powered and, they're battle cars! This game is unbelievably fun, even if you dont like this sort of game, i'm yet to meet anyone who has a bad word to say about Rocket League. This is a game that anyone can pick up, no matter what your skill level is, however the skill cap for this game is incredibly high, so it's fun for the casual gamer and the hardcore gamers. I would reccommend this to literally anyone, and i challenge you to play it and not like it!

												This game doesn’t really need another “thumbs up” but I feel obligated to write a review since I spent 100+ hours playing it (by the way, that’s a lie! I only played a couple of matches!) 

It doesn’t matter if you are a racing/football fan or not. You’ll love it. This game appeals to both casual and competitive players. You will suck most of the time and sometimes score amazing goals and it would feel incredible! This is one of those games that is easy to learn and very hard to master. I am still horrible at it after 100 hours. The good thing is that it is still entertaining even if you are losing more often than winning. 

So is it a great game? Hell, yes! Do I recommend it? No, unless you want to get sucked in and get addicted to this devil’s child of a game. 

I got it for free with Steam hardware. At this point I am ready to pay $20 just to get rid of it. I am uninstalling it tonight. I am just going to play one match real quick. Ok, maybe two... 

Addiction Level: Crack cocaine / 10.

UPDATE: I now have 300+ hours in this game. Please send help.
UPDATE 2: 500 hours... whatever, keep my soul, Rocket League!"

												Simple competitive fun with lots more. 

I've become old and boring and haven't truly enjoyed playing games with strangers for nearly a decade. I just don't like being on other people's time and sitting in lobbies. I'd rather play singleplayer these days. But Rocket League brought me back into the fold. You're rarely waiting on other people. You can drop in to most modes within seconds and games are merely five minutes of clock time and pauses for goals. Its simple, quick, doesn't waste your time. I enjoy that. Not to mention the game itself is fun fun fun! And there is a subpar singleplayer even. 

I was indoctrinated with the standard ""soccer"" modes of 3v3 but as I plateau'd and didn't develop into a competitive player I branched out into the less popular modes and matchups. There's plenty here to keep people of all skill levels, shapes, and sizes happy. E-Sports level competitiveness with the ability to join with your friends right down to what I'm doing casually bouncing into 2 or 3 ""Rumble"" matches with strangers when I got the time. Rocket League did something else for me too. The PC has a barren desert in the sports genre and this mildly and subtly fills the void a little more.

They're also consistently adding new free content and updates. All the while keeping paid DLC cosmetic. I could care less about all the knick-knacks as I don't even decorate my car but its got all that item customization people like. Wheels, paints, decals, toppers(hats), etc. They even added a crate system for those so inclined. Full price might be a little steep now that they do indeed have all these other avenues of revenue but that's what sales are for and I'd recommend waiting for one. Recommended!"

												LAUNCH WEEK WARNING: The game servers are having problems at the moment, and when they're down you're stuck to offline play. If you're only buying this for multiplayer, I recommend waiting until the devs sort things out.

Vehicular Football/Soccer is not something one usually thinks about, so it's not something one would imagine they need in their life.

In a single match of Rocket League, I learned that it's something most people need more of in their lives. I still have much more to experience out of this game, so I may update the review as I go. As it stands, Rocket League is an incredibly fun indie racing-sports game. You are a car/truck, and you play football/soccer by driving into a giant bouncy ball. You have rocket boosters. You have vertical jump boosters. You can wall climb, ceiling crawl, bicycle kick, and sometimes explode.

Rocket League is the embodiment of ""Easy to learn, difficult to master"" gameplay. This means it is very accessible, but there's skills you can work on to improve your game. If you play just one match of Rocket League, you'll know how to play all the basics. For the advanced, there's learning better ball control with double-tapping, flying, and so on.

Teamwork is absolutely effective. Get this, get your friends to get this, join a party and play as a team. Just like actual football/soccer! With flying, exploding, spinning, rocket cars.

I'm still working through the game's content. There's offline exhibition games, a Season mode, online play, and tutorials. I'm hoping for some really intense online bracket tournaments involving multiple teams, but so far I've only played regular online matches. There's also local split-screen play, and cross-play with PS4 players! As of right now, I feel like most players are PS4 online, because no one seems to use the chat at all.

I have one small gripe, but it may just tie in to the server troubles mentioned above: the matchmaking could be better. The matchmaking system is competent when it first sets a game up, but if a player drops, it doesn't seem to try to bring new players in. If a whole team leaves after a match, sometimes it will hang on the matchmaking for so long, it's faster for your team to just quit that match and create a whole new match, with new matchmaking that works. But bear this workaround in mind, and you can avoid those waiting periods.

Update Edit: Although there's no traditional dedicated server listings, you can setup Private Matches with just your buddies or what not. Retracted that comment from matchmaking gripes.

Just pure, nonsensical, sporting good times to be had here. A must have unless you despise racing, or sports, but honestly, you might even find yourself having a good time then too.

To think that I spent 2 years hyping over Batman: Arkham Knight, and that whole ♥♥♥♥♥torm goes down, and I have more fun with Rocket League in fifteen minutes than I probably ever will with that game. And for only $20."

												If you and some friends are looking for something fun and light-weight to mess around with this summer while waiting for fall releases, Rocket League should prove a worthy candidate. Playing with random strangers or with AI provides a significantly less enjoyable experience as it is the camaraderie and “oh man, did you see that!” moments that elevate the game above its simple premise. The promise of free content updates and the highly active community are further incentives to join the fun, though the staying power of the game is something that will be revealed only with time.

												Hey guys, it's Super Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars...2? Or I guess Rocket League?

Rocket League is one of those ideas you're surprised has not been done yet. But it's totally been done before. What Rocket League does is refine, simplify, and intensify.

Pros:Stellar and easy-to-grasp controls that invoke ""Easy to learn but hard to master""
Stellar visuals and optimization on PC. The grass looks magnificant!
A good variety of cosmetics to use.
Absolutely god damn fun. Matches are energetic, intense, filled with determination, and sometimes insane errors.
A neato soundtrack. Personal favorites are Whiplash and Fireworks.
Nitpicks:The game does not have a lot of unique modes beyond it's simple Soccer mode, with several varients like Snow Day.
Cons:The ranking system (As of Season 1) is absolutely broken. Those who have fallen far behind the ladder have absolutely zero chance to rank up. As of Season 2, the ranking system will be swapped to something like CS:GO, so this will definitely fix these problems.
As with any multiplayer game, it's supplement AI are not the best to play with, making modes like Season not so enjoyable to play. Thankfully, most online matches normally don't involve them, so they don't affect the game in a similar fashion that bots do in CS.
The Review
Rocket League is the result of a well-refined concept that's made it's debut back in 2008 as Super-Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars. While SARPBC had a whole lot more modes, maps and content, Rocket League is a lot more light in content, but that's because that was something the devs didn't focus on. Instead, Rocket League is a much more refined and focused game.

The game plays and feels amazing, and this is because of what's changed since then. The cars have weight to them, which gives the player the feeling that they have much more control.

It's team-based play is also very solid, because you're playing as an individual player, there's a lot of real coordination and technique that makes it so different from playing, say Fifa. It's so refreshing to play a sport game that brings out something that most of those games don't, and it's the indidviduality of the players. The want to stand out among others, or to stay behind and support your friends, that's the ingenuity of Rocket League.

It does lack in content however. It may be offputting that the simple, Soccer-based mode is really the only mode in the game, and a lot of the maps are in a similar layout, but that's what makes this game feel so refined. It's excusable because it's so fun to continue playing match after match. It's like Soccer; It never gets old.

It's presentation is solid too. It has a surprisingly beast soundtrack, with the likes of Hollywood Principle stealing the show. It's visuals, while not on par with big Triple AAA games, looks crisp and beautiful. The grass on the fields look mighty damn shiny, and the cars models are smiplistic and detailed.

Psyonix did a fantastic job taking a good concept, execute it once, and refine it years later into a much more enjoyable experience. Rocket League may not have a ton of maps, or game modes, but what it has is a game that will continues to amaze (and ♥♥♥♥) me to all sorts of levels.

TL;DR - Rocket League is a energetic and satisfying game that feels more like soccer then games like Fifa. And that's weird.

We can also demolish other people who play badly, which is a great plus to get some annoyance off.

												To give you an idea of how good this game is - I currently have 511 games in my Steam library, and this is the only one I've gone out of my way to review. 

SARPBC (the PS3 predecessor to Rocket League) has been a favorite of my friends and I for... years. Literally years. We've put thousands of hours into it. It's one of those incredibly rare games that all of us are always keen to play because it's always fun. 

Rocket League, I'm happy to say, is SARPBC with improved graphics and gameplay, better accessibility for new players, plus a ton of added options that give the game an extra layer of character. It's going to comfortably replace SARPBC in my top five games, all-time, across all genres. It's also replacing SARPBC as my absolute favorite multiplayer game - online or local. 


Positive

+ Fun, deep, brilliantly fast-paced gameplay
+ Games are long enough to mean something, but short enough that a loss is never too frustrating.
+ Games are almost never over until the final buzzer. Results can turn on a dime - and when they do, it's always because a player or team has stepped up, rather than any fault of or flaw with the game itself. 
+ The learning curve is fairly smooth, but the skill ceiling is also incredibly high. Despite the aforementioned years playing SARPBC, I still see players in Rocket League pulling off moves that I can only dream of.
+ There's massive flexibility in how you play, more than any other game I know of. Offline with bots. Offline split-screen. Online. Online split-screen. Online split-screen with bots. 1 v 1 if you don't feel like playing on a team, or 2 v 2 / 3 v 3 / 4 v 4 if you do. And the game is just as suited to mano-a-mano matches as it is to team play, which is (again) a very, very rare quality.


Negative

- The one slightly disappointing thing I'll mention is (at launch) the lack of variety in maps. SARPBC had a bunch of quite inventive, distinctive maps that forced different play styles and tactics. Rocket League's maps are aesthetically different, but structurally uniform. Luckily, word is that some 'crazier' maps will likely be arriving in the forthcoming free DLC.  I'm still thoroughly enjoying what's already there, but some extra variety in that regard will definitely be welcome.


Conclusion

If the idea of fast-paced soccer (sans rules) with cars even vaguely appeals to you, get this game immediately. It's one I fully expect to still be playing - and thoroughly enjoying - years from now."
