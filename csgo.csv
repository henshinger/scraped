												The community is terrible.Competitive
Screaming Russians in every game. Going full ♥♥♥♥♥ storm on anyone who isn’t listening to them.

12-year-old kids (or kids in general), who think they are the best, and promotes themselves to be the IGL, and starts flaming and vote kicking anyone who isn’t listening to them spam the mic chat with ""GJ GJ"", ""HIS BEHINDE YOU WITH A AK-47 AND HES ONLY HAVING 69 HP LEFT YOU SHOULD PICK UP THAT AWP NEXT TO YOU NO WAIT USE YOUR PISTOL- AND I KILLED MYSELF BECASUE I HAVE TO KEEP SPAMING WHAT EVER HAPPENS SO IM MAKING SURE YOU GET IT- OH MAN WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DID YOU DIE DONT YOU HAVE A HEADSET BLA BLA BLABLA""

Casual
People in casual vote kicking people for being afk for approximately 2 minutes, Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing Christ. It’s a ♥♥♥♥ing casual game not a competitive match. If the person is doing something that takes time, ofc they are going to play ♥♥♥♥ing casual instead of a comp.

Again, kids. Kids spamming their mic with trash. When they are dead, they proceed to mic spam positions of the enemy team, but the thing is: kids are stupid and do not know that when you are dead. People will not be able to hear you, only the other dead players.

People spamming the chat with ""N00b! u suk uninstall game!"" in a casual match. Seriously, it’s a casual game; half of the teams are players under rank 3, or players warming up. 

 As you might have guessed, English is not my native language. I might update this review at some point 

Edit: So I've noticed in the comment section, that people think I have a problem with this. I don't, its a review, like a heads up for the people who are going to, or consider buying the game, so they are kinda ""prepared"" for whats ahead of them. I'm perfectly fine with this, jezz guys, I've spent more then 900 hours in game."

												this game is like a drug

you're tempted not to buy it

but you get peer pressured by your friends

so you decided to buy it

when you first did it, it felt pretty good

but then you realize the health hazards and decided to quit after awhile

however after awhile you got restless and decided to come back

you eventually stop sleeping for 2 months and die of sleep deprivation

drugs are bad

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a pretty great game.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 
First things first, the basic rules.

In CS:GO, you have the choice to play five official gamemodes:

-Arms Race
-Deathmatch
-Demolition
-Casual
-Competitive

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Summary of gamemodes: 

In Arms Race, the player gets weapons not by the money, but by killing people. Each two kills get you a new weapon. At the final stage of the weapon, you will get the Gold Knife. Kill someone with it, and you win.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Deathmatch, yes. In Deathmatch, it is like a ""warm-up"" or ""practice"" mode. For me, at least. In this gamemode, you join a server, and you just kill everybody you see, except your teammates. You can get weapons for free. There are also random occasions in which the game will tell you that a weapon currently has bonus points, and if you want to use that particular weapon, you press g by default. The person who gets the most points, wins.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

So next in the list, is Demolition. It is set to be a 5 vs 5 match. It also has 20 rounds. The first team to get 11 rounds wins, and it can even finish with a tie. In the first half, you play as a set team. In the second, you play as the other team. You cannot buy any weapons, but instead, you get weapons by killing people, just like in Arms Race. Money is also not rewarded. 

But this is different: let's make a scenario. In (Round 1), you kill an enemy. the weapon will be rewarded to you on the next round. But what if you kill two in one round? You still get to advance to the next weapon, but you get a bonus grenade. For example:

2 kills: next wep + bonus grenade
3 kills: next wep + 2 bonus grenades

Get the pattern? Yeah. 

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

What next? Oh, yeah. It's Casual. 

Casual is a 10vs10 game, with 15 rounds. The first team to get 8 wins, wins the match. It is split into two sub-gamemodes: Bomb Defusal (IIRC), and Hostage. Sorry, I don't know the exact names. In Bomb Defusal, there are two bomb sites. A and B. The Counter-Terrorists always have the Defusal Kit equipped, even if they didn't buy it. The kit shortens the defusal time from 10 to 5 seconds.

The terrorists can freely choose which site they want to plant in. The bomb, iirc, has a 45 second timer. 
When defusing / planting the bomb, it makes a noise. Of course, the CTs are trying to stop them.

Counter-Terrorists can win in two ways: killing all of the Ts before they plant the bomb, or defusing the bomb.
For the terrorists, it's the same: killing all of the CTs, or making the bomb explode.

So in Hostage, the roles are switched: the terrorists are now the defending side, and vice-versa. As the gamemode says, the Ts are holding some people hostage. And it is up to the CTs to get the hostages, or kill all of the Ts.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Finally, competitive.

The competitive gamemode is much like the Casual gamemode, except a few differences:

- Each kill has 2x more money reward than in Casual.
- Defusal Kits / Rescue Kits cost money, and they don't get equipped automatically for free.
- It's a 5v5.
- Competitive has 30 rounds.
- Each half has 15 rounds, and in both halves, you get to play as CTs and Ts.
- Like the Demolition Gamemode, the match can end in a tie.
- People are much more serious.
- ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

So, here is my thoughts.

CS:GO offers a large variety of gamemodes, and you can just see that I've written about all of them. Phew, that took a lot of time. Anyway, CS:GO is a very entertaining game, and each match has a different experience. Yes, CS:GO can be a bit too serious, but it is also a fun game. The community is not just a single person, you know. There are people who don't like you, and some don't care, but some will make your day better.

GO is a game with a high skill ceiling. There is a huge learning curve to go in this game. 
It's like chess. Easy to learn, hard to master.

I've met a huge amount of my friends in CS:GO, and I still talk to them. Some, I don't. Yeah. They'll be grumpy at times, but they inspire me. There are some bugs in this game, but not too gamebreaking. Just a few small ones. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet. Ping matters. 

I hope you know that CS:GO is available for consoles, too. In fact, VALVe talked about having cross-platform multiplayer, but that would be unfair for the console players, cause they have a delay in controls. I am 100% sure that VALVe completely abandoned Global Offensive in the console. 

The competitive scene is pretty huge, too. And a tournament even reached more than a million viewers! Online and in the tournament itself. It's only two years old, and it's already a big game. VALVe may not be the most listening, but they try. Except sometimes they make some aspects of the game turn to ♥♥♥♥. Like the AWP. They reduced the movement speed while scoping.

There are also skins in CS:GO. Some care about it, some don't. Just a matter of personal preference. I think they're part of why this game is popular.

The most negative opinion I have, though, is about the Competitive gamemode. Sure, ""no game is perfect"", and the real fun is there, yeah, but the banning system needs some stuff to be taken care of. You know, just a few tweaks, like forgiving a person if he accidentally kills someone. It is pretty unforgiving. For who doesn't know, you can get banned for killing a teammate too many times, or leaving the game. If someone abandons your team, you can surrender.

Not permanent bans, though.

The VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) System also needs some fixing to be done. Some cheats aren't fully detected, so the hacker doesn't get VACed. From my experiences, I still haven't encountered a hacker, but that's probably because I'm a Silver. Some people can be real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.
So that's my review. Hoped you like it!

EDIT: I missed a few points, thanks > SKaREO

About the netcode of CS:GO, truth be told, it HAS been really bad... for a few weeks now in fact. I go up to a guy and spray him, but most of the time it registers 2 or 3 hits out of 8 for example which could be lethal. Take note, that's in close quarters. No, that's not horrible aim. In the words of a truly horrible player, ""omfg 64-tick sucks volvo pls 128-tick"". Eh, doesn't really suck, just... well, mixed?

In Global Offensive, there are a few advantages. Some on the T side, and some on the CT side. Hm, what's it called? Yeah, the perspective. Take this for an example, the ""left shoulder advantage"". 
| http://i.imgur.com/kVpjg.jpg?1 | Here's an explanation: the player models hold guns on the right side. Therefore holding angles or peeking with left shoulder is more favorable as your model is less exposed. TheWarOwl has this video to make advantage of your perspective:

			Views: 836,916		
		
			Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tutorial on perspective, how to get the advantage over your opponent using positioning. Dominate the enemy with simple geometry!		
	
 | And that's well-- unfair. Just like in real life, should I see your eyes, you will see mine, too.

As I said earlier, VAC needs some fixing. It's terrible. But again, I still haven't played with any cheaters, so I can't fully review this part yet. Thanks.

Final conclusion: an EXCELLENT game. There's bugs and glitches, but it's a fine piece of work. Go get it if you haven't already have it. Already do? Well what're you doing reading this review? Go play!

BTW: CS:GO has gotten an update where the voice chat quality has improved.
Thanks valve!

TL;DR: ayy lmao 10/10 ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥

												Pros: 
-It's a huge e-sport

-very well done maps

-it has it's own weapons system that's very unique and adds an incredibly high learning curve.

-It keeps a classic arcade feel to the game so it's easy to pick up

The game has seen worse times, but even still, it's terribly flawed.

Cons:
-Unless you're playing in a LAN, where everyone is in the same room, you're going to have tons of hit registration problems.

-Valve's 64 tick servers are great for lower ranks from Silver to Master Guardian. But once you get past that, you've probably accumulated some skill and an understanding of the game and how it works. Quite often, while playing a competitive matchmaking, you'll shoot at someones head, see blood, and absolutely nothing will happen in your favor. 
128 tick servers exist, but you need to go to a third party to use them, which seems pretty excessive just to play the game with a few less problems.

-The community is the most toxic, vile, absurd- you know what. Just get a dictionary and every single word that has a negative connotation will pretty much describe the community that plays this game. 

-Hackers EVERYWHERE. Hackers are insanely abundant and carry on without a care in the world. They don't worry about getting banned because they have no problem buying the game again, especially if it goes on sale, and just hacking all over again. This is probably the biggest reason Valve doesn't do anything to REALLY try and put a stop to it. But why would they? It makes them money when someone finally does it get banned so who cares about the legit players who try to enjoy the game for what it is, right?

-There are a certain number of bugs and exploits that are in the game, that haven't ever really been addressed. For example, a persistant sound bug that sounds like someone is running when in fact nobody is there. (I believe they have fixed the running audio glitch but there are many more issues yet to be addressed.)

-The developers put out updates, and just when you think it's something useful, like fixing a bug or exploit that's been making the game unfair, they just add more sounds! Or adjust sound levels! Pretty much nothing that matters to serious players. 

Conclusion:
The game at its core is a decent game. But you can't play it the way it's 'meant' to be played with just the game itself. For actually decent servers, and a SLIGHTLY more tolerable community, you need to sign up with a third party website that hosts their own servers so you can play the game. But those matches don't count for anything in the game itself, it's pretty much just a platfom to work around. 

If you're going to get the game just for a time killer and don't plan to take it serious then great. But otherwise, don't waste your money or your time.

I manage(d) four community competetive servers that are fairly popular, and I used to have a blast playing on them. But now whenever I go into the servers, it usually ends in me having to ban the ENTIRE lobby. I've quite literally yelled about how tired I was of babysitting because that's exactly what I had to do. I'm very accustomed to seeing hackers and cheaters from monitoring so many for so long with my time on the servers so when I play matchmaking matches the hacks are very easy to spot out. 'Professional' players have been banned for hacking before for crying out loud.

The first few hundred hours of my gameplay were pretty fun. The learning curve made it challenging and different and that's what I enjoyed. But the higher rank you get and the more serious you play, the more terrible everything becomes. I've made it to Supreme Master First Class, (Rank before Global Elite, highest rank in the game's ranking system.) and I can't say that I want to bother trying to get Global or playing anymore in general. At this point, every other match has a hacker or at the very least a griefer or extremely toxic person that wants to spoil your day. Whether a hacker is blatant or not, it becomes pretty apparent when someone's playing unfairly. 

All in all, there's no sportmanship or respect in a game that would do extremely well with both of those things, and the lack of feedback from developers in helping clean up the community or create better servers is very unsettling, especially for one of the most popular games on Steam.

But you don't have to believe me, play the game and see for yourself. But you've been warned."

												Counter Strike: Global Offensive

Counterstrike is a game that slowly ravages and pulverizes your soul each and every time you play it. 

Everyone starts with the same thoughts when they play CS:GO: 

1) 'Pfft. I'm never going to spend money in game buying skins and keys, that's stupid'
2) I'm never going to get that angry, it's only a game. 
3) 'Meh, doesn't look that hard'

Within a month -
Within a week - 

1) You’ve already have bought a P90 module skin because ""Oh, It's only 30p"" and you begin your slow downward spiral into the CS:GO marketplace, saving up for a knife and opening crates, in hopes of getting a knife which (deep on the inside, deep deep down) you know you're never going to get, and end up spending £10 opening crates, and getting back 50p worth of skins back. 
 2) You’ve probably already threatened a handful of people with their lives; it’s a game that can turn any lovely human being into a soul eating behemoth within minutes of a match starting.  Get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity. 
3) You'll already gave uninstalled the game at least twice, in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game. But you can't, you'll always go back.

The community is utterly merciless and beastly, with over half the people being angry 12 year old Russians. The betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins. And the trading is completely unreliable, leaving you to deal with steam support, which is 10x more brutal than the game itself. 

But of course you’ll go back, it’s CS:GO, it’s a drug. A soul destroying, mind numbing, murder spree inducing drug.
EDIT: HA. Oops."

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a pretty great game.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 
First things first, the basic rules.

In CS:GO, you have the choice to play five official gamemodes:

-Arms Race
-Deathmatch
-Demolition
-Casual
-Competitive

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Summary of gamemodes: 

In Arms Race, the player gets weapons not by the money, but by killing people. Each two kills get you a new weapon. At the final stage of the weapon, you will get the Gold Knife. Kill someone with it, and you win.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Deathmatch, yes. In Deathmatch, it is like a ""warm-up"" or ""practice"" mode. For me, at least. In this gamemode, you join a server, and you just kill everybody you see, except your teammates. You can get weapons for free. There are also random occasions in which the game will tell you that a weapon currently has bonus points, and if you want to use that particular weapon, you press g by default. The person who gets the most points, wins.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

So next in the list, is Demolition. It is set to be a 5 vs 5 match. It also has 20 rounds. The first team to get 11 rounds wins, and it can even finish with a tie. In the first half, you play as a set team. In the second, you play as the other team. You cannot buy any weapons, but instead, you get weapons by killing people, just like in Arms Race. Money is also not rewarded. 

But this is different: let's make a scenario. In (Round 1), you kill an enemy. the weapon will be rewarded to you on the next round. But what if you kill two in one round? You still get to advance to the next weapon, but you get a bonus grenade. For example:

2 kills: next wep + bonus grenade
3 kills: next wep + 2 bonus grenades

Get the pattern? Yeah. 

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

What next? Oh, yeah. It's Casual. 

Casual is a 10vs10 game, with 15 rounds. The first team to get 8 wins, wins the match. It is split into two sub-gamemodes: Bomb Defusal (IIRC), and Hostage. Sorry, I don't know the exact names. In Bomb Defusal, there are two bomb sites. A and B. The Counter-Terrorists always have the Defusal Kit equipped, even if they didn't buy it. The kit shortens the defusal time from 10 to 5 seconds.

The terrorists can freely choose which site they want to plant in. The bomb, iirc, has a 45 second timer. 
When defusing / planting the bomb, it makes a noise. Of course, the CTs are trying to stop them.

Counter-Terrorists can win in two ways: killing all of the Ts before they plant the bomb, or defusing the bomb.
For the terrorists, it's the same: killing all of the CTs, or making the bomb explode.

So in Hostage, the roles are switched: the terrorists are now the defending side, and vice-versa. As the gamemode says, the Ts are holding some people hostage. And it is up to the CTs to get the hostages, or kill all of the Ts.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Finally, competitive.

The competitive gamemode is much like the Casual gamemode, except a few differences:

- Each kill has 2x more money reward than in Casual.
- Defusal Kits / Rescue Kits cost money, and they don't get equipped automatically for free.
- It's a 5v5.
- Competitive has 30 rounds.
- Each half has 15 rounds, and in both halves, you get to play as CTs and Ts.
- Like the Demolition Gamemode, the match can end in a tie.
- People are much more serious.
- ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

So, here is my thoughts.

CS:GO offers a large variety of gamemodes, and you can just see that I've written about all of them. Phew, that took a lot of time. Anyway, CS:GO is a very entertaining game, and each match has a different experience. Yes, CS:GO can be a bit too serious, but it is also a fun game. The community is not just a single person, you know. There are people who don't like you, and some don't care, but some will make your day better.

GO is a game with a high skill ceiling. There is a huge learning curve to go in this game. 
It's like chess. Easy to learn, hard to master.

I've met a huge amount of my friends in CS:GO, and I still talk to them. Some, I don't. Yeah. They'll be grumpy at times, but they inspire me. There are some bugs in this game, but not too gamebreaking. Just a few small ones. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet. Ping matters. 

I hope you know that CS:GO is available for consoles, too. In fact, VALVe talked about having cross-platform multiplayer, but that would be unfair for the console players, cause they have a delay in controls. I am 100% sure that VALVe completely abandoned Global Offensive in the console. 

The competitive scene is pretty huge, too. And a tournament even reached more than a million viewers! Online and in the tournament itself. It's only two years old, and it's already a big game. VALVe may not be the most listening, but they try. Except sometimes they make some aspects of the game turn to ♥♥♥♥. Like the AWP. They reduced the movement speed while scoping.

There are also skins in CS:GO. Some care about it, some don't. Just a matter of personal preference. I think they're part of why this game is popular.

The most negative opinion I have, though, is about the Competitive gamemode. Sure, ""no game is perfect"", and the real fun is there, yeah, but the banning system needs some stuff to be taken care of. You know, just a few tweaks, like forgiving a person if he accidentally kills someone. It is pretty unforgiving. For who doesn't know, you can get banned for killing a teammate too many times, or leaving the game. If someone abandons your team, you can surrender.

Not permanent bans, though.

The VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) System also needs some fixing to be done. Some cheats aren't fully detected, so the hacker doesn't get VACed. From my experiences, I still haven't encountered a hacker, but that's probably because I'm a Silver. Some people can be real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.
So that's my review. Hoped you like it!

EDIT: I missed a few points, thanks > SKaREO

About the netcode of CS:GO, truth be told, it HAS been really bad... for a few weeks now in fact. I go up to a guy and spray him, but most of the time it registers 2 or 3 hits out of 8 for example which could be lethal. Take note, that's in close quarters. No, that's not horrible aim. In the words of a truly horrible player, ""omfg 64-tick sucks volvo pls 128-tick"". Eh, doesn't really suck, just... well, mixed?

In Global Offensive, there are a few advantages. Some on the T side, and some on the CT side. Hm, what's it called? Yeah, the perspective. Take this for an example, the ""left shoulder advantage"". 
| http://i.imgur.com/kVpjg.jpg?1 | Here's an explanation: the player models hold guns on the right side. Therefore holding angles or peeking with left shoulder is more favorable as your model is less exposed. TheWarOwl has this video to make advantage of your perspective:

			Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tutorial on perspective, how to get the advantage over your opponent using positioning. Dominate the enemy with simple geometry!		
	
 | And that's well-- unfair. Just like in real life, should I see your eyes, you will see mine, too.

As I said earlier, VAC needs some fixing. It's terrible. But again, I still haven't played with any cheaters, so I can't fully review this part yet. Thanks.

Final conclusion: an EXCELLENT game. There's bugs and glitches, but it's a fine piece of work. Go get it if you haven't already have it. Already do? Well what're you doing reading this review? Go play!

BTW: CS:GO has gotten an update where the voice chat quality has improved.
Thanks valve!

TL;DR: ayy lmao 10/10 ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥

												I had a lot of fun some years back in the 2012-2014 reaching the rank of Supreme mostly playing with friends but also as solo. I came back this year to try the game again after some absence from the scene. 


WTF has happened? 

This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.

DON'T GET ME WRONG HERE
I have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.

Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.

Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.

There is huge but in all this:

Are you willing to pay a subscription?
If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.

This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates. And this scenario this year doesn't happen for the first time."

												I can both say yes and no to recommend this game.

Counter-Strike, can be good with friends but if you try to play a lot of random games to climb the ranks you will encounter the second most toxic gaming community ever. You get every kind of stereotype on here from the kid who slept with your mother to some guy calling everyone a b*tch N*gga. 

With well over 2000 hours I can not recommend CS:GO in its current condition. Why is that?

-Servers. The servers are horrible. 64 tick is not enough to play on. You will often encounter bullets that do no damage yet there is blood on the walls behind them. Their performance is lack luster and lots of servers are doing a stutter/stop as of lately or the registration is just... Non-existant.

-Hackers. They are still running rampant in CSGO. ""Prime"" accounts are still subject to them. It seems as if VAC is not working at all. You will encounter a LOT of them from Silver to MGE. (There are smurfs but you can tell them apart from hackers very easily. I enjoy playing smurfs as I see it as a chance to see what I need to work on to get better.)

-Toxic community. This game relies on three very major things. 1. Aim 2. Communication 3. Listening. There are very seldom times that you will come across a team that is willing to Communicate and Listen. From my experience (MGE or lower for the majority) A lot of people do not communicate because they are talking too much and when you ask them to hush for the rest of the game and to type, they throw hissy fits as if their mother just denied them a cookie. If you try to communicate with people and call stuff, and they blame you for their death becuase you're trying to communicate where the enemies are. ""One B"" - Teammate dies - ""OMG WHY DID YOU SAY HE WAS BE WHEN CLEARLY THEY ARE A!""  Everyone ALWAYS tries to blame others instead of understanding that it was just good timing on their end. 

-Gambling addictions with opening cases. Opening cases can be fun at times. However, the absolutely horrible prices for keys makes it a very expensive risk if you get a simple item that is only worth $0.02 on the CM. A lot of people waste their money here. 


NOW FOR THE GOOD

-Meeting awesome new people. I have met quite a few people on here. Some of the best people I have ever had the chance to encounter. It was awesome! We still enjoy kicking back and having a few beers. 

-Gaming Tournaments. TONS of LAN parties play CSGO or CS1.6 and it's an absolute amazing time. Everyone gets super serious but also come out of it with smiles, win or lose. 

-Hand + Eye coordination improvement. My hand and eye coordination used to be utterly horrible. However, MAAAAAAAANY years ago, when I first got CS1.5 my hand and eye coordination improved drastically over the time. 


Would I recommend this game? Yes and no

Yes - Having fun with friends is great!
No - Everything stated that was bad. And it grows the more and more you play."

												I feel really bad writing this review :(
The game itself is just awesome...9/10 (no joke this game is nearly perfect)
BUT there's a very big problem that makes me not recommend this game for y'all
There are just TOO MANY cheaters...TOO MANY Russian and Turkish raging 10 year old kids...TOO MANY toxic players who try to tell you what to do all the time and they can't play for ♥♥♥♥ ...
Overall the biggest problem of this great game is the community which completely ruins it and makes it nearly unplayable
Just go and see how people talk and play in games such as rainbow6 or insurgency and you'll get what i mean...
UPDATE : What I found very interesting about CSGO's reviews is 40-60% of the positive reviews are just telling the problems of the game and cons so... yeah:|
UPDATE 2 : I completely forgot about hit registration in this game... Its pretty f...ed up too... You shoot a player right in the face with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AWP and nothing happens then you get 1tapped instantly and your just sitting there wondering who you should swear at...
 (so yeah 1more reason not to buy this game...)"

Há quase 12 anos um mod de Half-Life surgia na rede desencadeando uma nova mania. Lan houses ficavam entupidas de jogadores que passavam horas jogando Counter-Strike. Quem nunca aqui virou a noite nos chamados corujões? Mais de uma década depois, CS está de volta na versão Global Offensive. E o game, por mais que seja uma cara nova pra um velho conhecido, já me deixou com vontade de chamar os amigos pra virar a noite jogando mais uma vez.

CS: Global Offensive não muda muita coisa em relação ao CS: Source ou o Counter-Strike 1.6 que todos devem conhecer. Ainda usando a Source Engine, mas dessa vez com os gráficos atualizados. Mais bonito e com uma interface atualizada, o game não tem nenhuma novidade. As armas são quase todas as mesmas e os modos de jogo se resumem aos mapas DE, de Defuse, aonde os terroristas devem plantar uma bomba, e CS, de resgatar os reféns.
Logo de cara ao jogar, me deparo com velhos conhecidos. Mapas clássicos como DE_Dust, DE_Aztec, CS_Italy e DE_Inferno ganharam uma cara nova. Todos mais realistas, mas sem perder os layouts e as formas de jogar conhecidas. A portinha na Aztec por exemplo continua sendo um lugar muito perigoso.

Fora os modos clássicos, uma arma nova chamou atenção. Chamada de Zeus, é um taser de um único tiro. Pra que matar na faca se você pode descarregar alguns milhares de volts no CT mais próximo? Outras duas novidades foram as granadas. A granada decoy é a mais barata da lista e não faz nada, senão enganar o inimigo de que alguma coisa pode explodir bem próximo. Já o Molotov é uma bomba que ao explodir deixa uma área do chão em chamas, causando dano a todos os jogadores que pisarem por ali. Bem útil para corredores pequenos e portas.

Também foram adicionados dois modos de jogo bem parecidos. O Arms Race é uma corrida em que ganha o primeiro jogador a matar um adversário com cada arma do jogo. Sem times, é um estilo de jogo nos moldes de um Deathmatch. Já Demolition é outro modo parecido em que os jogadores começam com as melhores armas do jogo e a cada sucesso ao matar um adversário, ele vai recebendo armas progressivamente mais fracas até o desafio final com a faquinha.

Outra novidade é com relação aos bots. Além de mais inteligentes agora enquanto você espera o fim de uma partida, você pode assumir o controle de um dos bots. Bom pra quem quer entrar na ação rapidamente e não quer ficar esperando o jogo acabar. Muito útil naquelas partidas online em que o time adversário inteiro resolve campear. Os menus também foram simplificados pra compra de armas. Agora ao invés de 8 categorias diminuíram para 6: pistolas, SMGs (submetralhadoras), rifles, heavy (armas pesadas como shotguns e metralhadoras), gear (equipamento) e granadas.

O sistema de matchmaking facilita bastante a procura de servidores. Em nenhum momento tive que esperar mais do que alguns segundos para encontrar um servidor de baixa latência dentro do modo de jogo que procurava.

Pra quem procura um jogo novo, CS Global Offensive pode decepcionar um pouco, mas, pra quem está buscando algo familiar e passar boas horas jogando um upgrade do velho conhecido, CS:GO pode ser uma bela escolha. O game está disponível por US$ 14,99 (aprox. R$ 31) na Steam para PC e Mac, como também para Xbox 360 e PS3 na Live e PSN respectivamente.

Almost 12 years ago a Half-Life mod appeared in the net triggering a new mania. Lan houses were clogged with players who spent hours playing Counter-Strike. Who never here turned the night in the so-called owls? More than a decade later, CS is back in the Global Offensive version. And the game, no matter how new it is to an old acquaintance, has already made me want to call friends to spend the night playing one more time.

CS: Global Offensive does not change much about CS: Source or Counter-Strike 1.6 that everyone should know about. Still using the Source Engine, but this time with the updated graphics. More beautiful and with an updated interface, the game has nothing new. The weapons are almost all the same and the modes of play boil down to Defuse's DE maps, where terrorists must plant a bomb, and CS, to rescue the hostages.
As soon as I play, I come across old acquaintances. Classic maps like DE_Dust, DE_Aztec, CS_Italy and DE_Inferno have gained a new face. All more realistic, but without losing the layouts and known ways of playing. The door in the Aztec for example remains a very dangerous place.

Apart from the classic modes, a new weapon caught attention. Called of Zeus, it is a taser of a single shot. Why kill on the knife if you can unload a few thousand volts at the nearest CT? Two other novelties were the grenades. The decoy grenade is the cheapest on the list and does nothing but fool the enemy that something can explode very close. Molotov is a bomb that explodes leaving an area of ​​the ground burning, causing damage to all players who step there. Very useful for small hallways and doors.

Two very good game modes have also been added. The Arms Race is a race in which the first player wins to kill an opponent with each weapon of the game. Without teams, it's a style of play in the shape of a Deathmatch. Demolition is another similar way in which players start with the best guns in the game and with each success by killing an opponent, it gets progressively weaker weapons until the final challenge with the knife.

Another novelty is with regard to bots. In addition to being smarter now as you wait for the end of a match, you can take control of one of the bots. Good for those who want to get into the action quickly and do not want to be waiting for the game to end. Very useful in those online matches in which the entire opposing team decides to win. The menus were also simplified to buy weapons. Now instead of 8 categories decreased to 6: pistols, SMGs (rifles), rifles, heavy (shotguns and machine guns), gear (equipment) and grenades.

The matchmaking system makes it much easier to find servers. At no point did I have to wait more than a few seconds to find a low-latency server within the game mode I was looking for.

For those looking for a new game, CS Global Offensive may disappoint a bit, but for those who are looking for something familiar and spending good hours playing an old-fashioned upgrade, CS: GO can be a beautiful choice. The game is available for $ 14.99 on Steam for PC and Mac, as well as for Xbox 360 and PS3 on Live and PSN respectively."

												I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons.

Firstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun.

Secondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more?

CS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience.

If you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades.

Until Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.)

EDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins.

ADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches.

Though I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers.

At first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches. 

@Shadowdance You're welcome. You gave me the push to write this reply.

Cheers fellow comrades."

EDIT3: I cant set a loadout when i go into a game. I also cant see any perks. Glitch?

EDIT4: After 3000 hours i finally got my 100th awp kill, but did not unlock an attachment for the weapon. Do i need 150 kills? I just want extended mags honestly.

EDIT5: I decided to get some skins, but they are not adding any stat boosts to my guns.  Where is the microtransaction to add stats?"

												The spiritual successor to ""The Secret of Monkey Island™"" (titled cs:go) is one of my personal favourite point and click adventures of all time; wether it's the engaging puzzles or intricate story, this game is always sure to provide hours upon hours of family friendly fun. the game's premise is that you're either a ""CT"" or a ""Counter-Troublemaker"" who's job is to stop the ""T's"" or ""Troublemaker's"" shenanigans, such as graffiti, egging houses, or the such. All these are of course now animated, comparative to the simplicity of  ""The Secret of Monkey Island™"". All in all, a great game and tons of fun. But it's kind of a rough port, and i'd reccomend purchase on ps3.

												Hello and welcome, new player. 
Allow me to reveal some of the likely outcomes of you purchasing this game:

The 'Cannon Fodder' (40% of all players) - Never really good enough to make it past Nova 3, constantly flaming, talking sh it, changing their names and pictures to things increasingly racist, blaming hackers, smurfs, lag and weapon choice of oponents for just what is a mixture of adderall exhausted reflexes and having a shi tty gaming rig from 2002, frame dropping on source games. 
Can be easily identified by it's trademark defence mechanism, when being called out for being bad the Cannon Fodder will attempt to convince it's team it has been 'Trolling' all along.

Habitat: Dust2

The 'Enthusiasts' (30% of all players) - A wide range of Skillsets from Nova Master to around Legendary Eagle, these players can perform consistantly and at least show a basic level of human decency,  most of them will give an unenthusastic hand job for $2.49USD because they feel they are 'due for a knife' or because 'my friend told me he had a feeling' Will one day be doing unspreakable things for a japenese businessman on a glass coffee table to pay off gambling debts that can be traced directly back to a greedy cu nt and his case racket.

Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache

The 'C unts' (15% of all players) - A curious breed, come in two distinct flavours 'Hacker' and i mean legit hacker, not hacker because he saw your shadow in bedroom on dust2 and prefired you, you fuc king mook, These are players who either used to or almost fit into the 'Enthusiast Category' and were turned into soulless, spineless dic kbags who cannot win on skill or merit. The other flavour, less cancerous but just as annoying 'Smurfs' people who play at levels far beneath there skill to boost their friends, ruin other peoples day for the joy of being a cu nt or to boost their dwindling ego that is one Sylvia Plath poem away from a stomach full of painkillers in the bathtub.

Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache, Train, Overpass, Inferno, Cobblestone, Office, Assault, Any Operation Maps

The 'Pros' (15% of all players) - Professional Esports player OR someone who has played enough CS (usually in excess of 1500 hours - 9 weeks to us humans) to get to a level where they know every smoke, every flash, every angle, every strat on every map and to you i say kudos, kudos on mastering a video game to the point you know it as well as your mothers disappointed face when she looks at you knowing that while normal people are studying, working or contributing to society in someway, you were hunched over your keyboard for the 7th straight hour of the day, mouth breathing in pleasure as that voice says 'Counter Terrorists Win'

Habitat: Mothers basement

11/10 would play again."

												When I was young, tragedy struck my neighborhood when a bomb went off in a local park. I lost my dear uncle in that accident. Along with my pet cat, two hamsters, one very courageous gold fish, my tickle-me elmo doll, and all of my foil Yu-Gi-Oh cards. It was the first time I experienced tragedy and despair, feelings that cut so deep I vowed to exact revenge upon whoever did this.
I trained every day, running 25 miles a week, lifting weights in 15 pound increments, taking protein supplements as well as spending the majority of my weekends at the firing range. I enlisted in the military, only to be turned down because I was ""only a kid.""
Then, I discovered Counter-Strike;Global Offensive. A perfect simulation of the events I wanted to prevent and take action upon, I was hooked immediately. I threw away my running sneakers for wool socks and sweatpants, as well as a swiveling chair. I put down my weights and protein supplements for Taco Bell and Instant Noodles. I stopped visiting the fire range and instead purchased a Razer gaming mouse.

Worth.
My uncle's still dead though."

You get screwed from people leaving your team
You find people that just like to afk grief and watch your team lose and probably laugh
You find people not skilled enough to play their ranks so they throw the match and derank down
You get in a match and someone needs to go afk for 5-15mins or leave
You play overpass
You realize playing overpass was a terrible choice
You get connection errors
You get screwed over by your IP and get a cooldown ban
You meet who lag purposely

You rank down
You Ace
You don't get a kill for a long while

You go 0-16
You learn the maps
You find out you didn't really learn said maps
You find people calling out to help the team
You find people with no mics to help out the team
You find people with mics that bought the cheapest mic possible

But yet in all the madness somehow it is ok....

You get back on the next day and go through the same roll of ♥♥♥♥ again and you do it with a smile.. at least when you start.

That my friends is a game that will carry on with you forever."

												I only got this game because everyone literally forced me to get it, so I got it, I played it. It was good in the beginning, until I started playing competitive, and why is that?
Well as I walked into my first competitive match, I got into a match with 4 Russians on my team, and enemy team consisted of 3 Russians and 2 Americans that only spoke Russian. When the game started I walked 4 steps towards mid and got instantly sniped through doors, and that was a teammate! My team lost half their players before we met the enemy...So after that game I came to the conclusion that all the Russians wanted was to ♥♥♥♥ my ♥♥♥♥♥.

Pros:
+Great maps, especially when they're filled with Russians!
+I got A+ in Russian after owning this game for a week.
+I can now insult my friends in Russian because they don't understand ♥♥♥♥!
+I finally fit in(This review is more about my life than the actual game)

Cons:
-Russians, duh
-Russians with guns!
-democracy!!!
-Screaming Russians
-Not enough Russians

I wonder how many dislikes I can get by saying this?"

												Counter Strike: Global Offensive

Counterstrike is a game that slowly ravages and pulverizes your soul each and every time you play it. 

Everyone starts with the same thoughts when they play CS:GO: 

1) 'Pfft. I'm never going to spend money in game buying skins and keys, that's stupid'
2) I'm never going to get that angry, it's only a game. 
3) 'Meh, doesn't look that hard'

Within a month -
Within a week - 

1) You’ve already have bought a P90 module skin because ""Oh, It's only 30p"" and you begin your slow downward spiral into the CS:GO marketplace, saving up for a knife and opening crates, in hopes of getting a knife which (deep on the inside, deep deep down) you know you're never going to get, and end up spending £10 opening crates, and getting back 50p worth of skins back. 
 2) You’ve probably already threatened a handful of people with their lives; it’s a game that can turn any lovely human being into a soul eating behemoth within minutes of a match starting.  Get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity. 
3) You'll already gave uninstalled the game at least twice, in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game. But you can't, you'll always go back.

The community is utterly merciless and beastly, with over half the people being angry 12 year old Russians. The betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins. And the trading is completely unreliable, leaving you to deal with steam support, which is 10x more brutal than the game itself. 

But of course you’ll go back, it’s CS:GO, it’s a drug. A soul destroying, mind numbing, murder spree inducing drug.
EDIT: HA. Oops."

												this game is like a drug

you're tempted not to buy it

but you get peer pressured by your friends

so you decided to buy it

when you first did it, it felt pretty good

but then you realize the health hazards and decided to quit after awhile

however after awhile you got restless and decided to come back

you eventually stop sleeping for 2 months and die of sleep deprivation

drugs are bad

												This game has been planned perfectly. 

Gabe's plan has worked perfectly.

I have unboxed around 3,400 cases so far and gotten 12 knives.
I have spent around $16,000 on this game so far and still play like ♥♥♥♥.
I have played over 300 competitive matches and am still a Silver.
Every matchmaking team I get is a team of Russians who like saying ""♥♥♥♥♥"" and have a grudge against Obama and have a microphone that sounds like a cat trying to gargle shards of glass.

I will keep on unboxing cases, playing like a handicapped person, stay on Silver and keep buying expensive skins that apparently are supposed to make me better but don't. 

Because after all, Gabe is love, Gabe is life."

												Must buy if you love FPS games!

This game is all about personal progression, since it comes with a high learning curve, it's not about unlocking some stupid grip or scope for your gun. It's about you, that has to learn.

The game is updated almost once a week with new features and content, Match Making is great when you are playing with friends.

The real game for people that love to play competitively, with a team or just solo.
 
There are also casual game modes available for the people that don't like to play competitively, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, Hostage and Defusual missions which can be played on casual style, or mostly known as public or community servers. These modes are great to learn the game, and improve your play.


Pros.
◘ Match Making.
◘ Skill levels and ranks, play against players of your own skill level.
◘ Competitive scene, with ladders and tournaments.
◘ The CS feeling, transition from older CS games to CS:GO isn't that hard.
◘ Most old maps from CS, are in the game.
◘ No perks and other unnecessary clutter.
◘ Great spectator sport, easily to understand and interesting to watch!
◘ No pay to win model, all items are purely cosmetic.


Cons.
◘ Match Making 64 tick servers stability could be improved.
◘ Game could use some optimization here and there.
◘ Cheaters now and then, but that's online gaming for you.

If you are looking to improve your aim skills, try out these maps.

												The community is terrible.Competitive
Screaming Russians in every game. Going full ♥♥♥♥♥ storm on anyone who isn’t listening to them.

12-year-old kids (or kids in general), who think they are the best, and promotes themselves to be the IGL, and starts flaming and vote kicking anyone who isn’t listening to them spam the mic chat with ""GJ GJ"", ""HIS BEHINDE YOU WITH A AK-47 AND HES ONLY HAVING 69 HP LEFT YOU SHOULD PICK UP THAT AWP NEXT TO YOU NO WAIT USE YOUR PISTOL- AND I KILLED MYSELF BECASUE I HAVE TO KEEP SPAMING WHAT EVER HAPPENS SO IM MAKING SURE YOU GET IT- OH MAN WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DID YOU DIE DONT YOU HAVE A HEADSET BLA BLA BLABLA""

Casual
People in casual vote kicking people for being afk for approximately 2 minutes, Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing Christ. It’s a ♥♥♥♥ing casual game not a competitive match. If the person is doing something that takes time, ofc they are going to play ♥♥♥♥ing casual instead of a comp.

Again, kids. Kids spamming their mic with trash. When they are dead, they proceed to mic spam positions of the enemy team, but the thing is: kids are stupid and do not know that when you are dead. People will not be able to hear you, only the other dead players.

People spamming the chat with ""N00b! u suk uninstall game!"" in a casual match. Seriously, it’s a casual game; half of the teams are players under rank 3, or players warming up. 

 As you might have guessed, English is not my native language. I might update this review at some point 

Edit: So I've noticed in the comment section, that people think I have a problem with this. I don't, its a review, like a heads up for the people who are going to, or consider buying the game, so they are kinda ""prepared"" for whats ahead of them. I'm perfectly fine with this, jezz guys, I've spent more then 900 hours in game."

												This review will probably trigger butthurts because it's going to focus on the positive things I have to say about the game, you have been warned. Global Offensive (CSGO) is the latest addition to the Counter-Strike franchise and it's also the best-selling one so far. I believe that there are four reasons for it's main success. 

The first reason is primarily because it greats new players well to an environment already filled with veterans. A great example is the games matchmaking system for competitive players which places you with others that are the same skill level. It seems to work very well from my experience, but it's definitely more comfortable to play with friends (just like any other team-based multiplayer game).

The second reason is how well they managed to implement new weapons and features to the game without destroying it's original charm. It's still the same game from 1999 but with slightly more diversity and variation which enhances the experience. The physics of the game adds more depth overall and allows you to throw coordinated smokes and other grenades which adds another layer of gameplay. 

The third reason is that watching professional teams and matches is engaging and fun. The built-in tools for spectating like for example x-ray makes it very easy to understand, even for someone that doesn't play the game. And yes, you will often find e-sport fans that prefer watching rather than playing because of the viewer satisfaction you get.

The fourth reason (and this is a big one) is the ability to customize your items appearance, thanks to a community driven workshop and marketplace. A vast majority of the community is busy buying and selling skins and other cosmetics because it can actually become profitable in the long-run, and uses real money.

You will get weekly or monthly updates which usually add, change or fix features, and sometimes an operation which introduces items and maps made partly by the developers, but more importantly by the community. Even if the game is heavily criticized by most, I still see it's charm for being what it is and I recommend this to anyone that likes team-based shooters.

TL;DR 

Game matches your skill with others, it has new weapons and features compare to the older releases while still retaining it's originial charm, watching a proffesional match is fun and there's a marketplace with virtual items that you can buy/sell/trade for real money.

If you want tips and tricks, I have a YouTube channel where I focus on tutorials:

												I feel really bad writing this review :(
The game itself is just awesome...9/10 (no joke this game is nearly perfect)
BUT there's a very big problem that makes me not recommend this game for y'all
There are just TOO MANY cheaters...TOO MANY Russian and Turkish raging 10 year old kids...TOO MANY toxic players who try to tell you what to do all the time and they can't play for ♥♥♥♥ ...
Overall the biggest problem of this great game is the community which completely ruins it and makes it nearly unplayable
Just go and see how people talk and play in games such as rainbow6 or insurgency and you'll get what i mean...
UPDATE : What I found very interesting about CSGO's reviews is 40-60% of the positive reviews are just telling the problems of the game and cons so... yeah:|
UPDATE 2 : I completely forgot about hit registration in this game... Its pretty f...ed up too... You shoot a player right in the face with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AWP and nothing happens then you get 1tapped instantly and your just sitting there wondering who you should swear at...
 (so yeah 1more reason not to buy this game...)"

												Seems like Valve has completely forgotten about this game. After 2.5k hours + I can honestly say it is one of the best games I have ever played. However, now I'm at the top end of the game, you struggle to find a legit game where there isn't any cheaters. You have to go to third party websites which charge monthly to play without cheaters, and even then there is still the odd few. So if you're a casual gamer looking for a time wasting game this is for you, however if you're willing to invest thousands of hours into this game to try and reach the top I wouldn't recommend it until Valve sorts out their anti-cheat (Which will never happen).

Keep adding Stat-Trak music kits and gloves to a 64-tick broken game Valve."

												Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has 5 games inside of it.

 Deathmatch 
     If you are new you have to play this game. even people with 500+ hours might play this game. In deathmatch you are          able to learn how to use the weapons and how to improve your aim. That is why there is a possibility to turn of random weapons to you can choose only 1. PLEASE if you have 100- hours play deathmatch. (Dont use SCAR-20 to mutch.. people will hate you!)

 Demolition 
     In this game you have to kill people to get new weapons. Here you will learn how to plant a bomb. and how to use maps. you will learn you have to look back and look everywhere so you wont be killed. Also it is a good way to use multiple weapons. Not like deathmatch 1 weapon youre good with. 

 Arms Race 
     This game is hard. You need to kill as mutch people as you can. There are 16 levels. every level is a new weapon. kill 2 people to go level up. the first one who is at level 16 gets a knife. If he kills someone with the knife he wins. the maps are small and there are a lot of people. here you learn how to use every weapon (every weapon shoots different) (this will help you in Casual and more important  Competitive.)

 Casual 
     This looks like  Competitive. You have team mates and you have to win. sometimes its 5 vs 5 6 vs 6 8 vs 8 10 vs 10.  They maked Casual easier. Them damage is turned of. and you wont get a Cooldown. If you want to play this: in the beginning this will be hard. and you wont get mutch kills. if you play more it will get better. 
You choose 1 side and you will stay the whole game that side

  Competitive 
      This mode is for players with atleast 300+ hours ( I Thinks.. and a lot of players think that 2). Everybody plays this serious. Cause here you play for ranks. team damage is turned on. Its the same as casual. Kill enemy and plant the bomb. 15 round as Counter-Strike and 15 rounds As terrorist. the team who wins 16 rounds wins the game.

What I also like about this game is the face that everyday over 100000 people are playing. Every mode are people. you meet every day new people and sometimes new friends. 

every week you get 3 drops. ( most of the time 2 cases and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon worth 3 cents. sometimes a weapon with is worth more).  if you recieved the 3 drops you have to wait till monday then they will reset it. ( drops are random)
Also there are cases you can open. this is addicted like hell. In a case there are weapons skins. some are worth nothing others are worth 50+ euro.. if you are very lucky 100 euro/dollar or MORE! 

EVERY ONE WANTS A KNIFE skin.

weapon skins are useable in game. you can buy them are you can open cases. ( if you dont have mutch money buy the weapons.. not the cases ;) ).

last thing. Operations and championsships. 

ever couple months there will be an operation. that means. you have to pay 5 euro/dollar. and you get: 
5 New maps. Lots of Missions. New weapon skins. That is cool cause this will make sure the game will stay fun.

Also every couple months there are contest between the best players of csgo. you can watch them live! thats cool!

I give this game a 10 out of 10."

After a long period playing this game (~1000h) I think I have the advantage to write a better review than my last!


First I want to say thank you Valve for making a nice game like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive!


BUT:
There are some things Valve has to change really fast!


1. Cheating:
There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it!

2. DDOS-ing:
I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure!

3. Smurfing:
Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this!

4. Patches:
Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem!

5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver):
Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***!

6. Community:
The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly.


Over all:
Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again! And I know that Valve can't fix the community, but I hope the community will get better!


PS: I'm from Germany, so there are maybe some spelling mistakes!"

												Beautiful game. First bullet accuracy of rifles is completely perfect, as is the miniscule RNG factor which doesn't affect anything at all.
Dedicated servers with more than 10 people don't have hit registration or choke/latency issues in the slightest.
Community is filled with mentally stable, rational, humble players dedicated to having fun while improving, not merely ranking up and flaming enemies and/or teammates. 
VAC is literally flawless on this game, never before have I encounted someone who I think twice about being absolutely 100% legitimate.
CS:GO developers have truly pruned this game into the best FPS of all time with their consistent efforts into listening to the community, bringing regular updates, game balancing patches and exciting new operations into Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Also goes well while coming down from a weeklong amphetamine induced psychosis. Never before has yelling at a computer game been so thrilling!"

												It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory.

You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own.

Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fu­ck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP.

You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b.

Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods.

You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'.

You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value."

												Both the competitive and guilty pleasure in my entire Steam library, CS:GO has captured both these conflictive aspects of mine spectacularly, as I've enjoyed over hundreds of hours, playing this joyous game. From the teamwork, player rankings, campaigns, competitive gameplay, music, replay value and much more, this game is a king amongst most modern, multi-player FPS' games and still going strong even over just a measly three years.

Just like its predecessors, the player assumes the role of either a counter-terrorist or a terrorist, both with their own unique missions, depending on the campaign in general. The newly added campaigns, Deathmatch and Arms race is a great exclusive extra if you're just a casual player, whereas there's the competitive session for the more experienced, intense and determined players out there.

With every match starting, you're brought into ''Freeze time.'' where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal, just ready to be bought, either with the money you've earned by killing opponents, or indeed losing a match respectively, still giving the losing team a winning chance. While with your team, you could stick together as there are power in numbers, or go alone to face your opposing enemies. I wouldn't talk for every individual player out there, as I've seen power in experienced players. Trust me, I have witnessed a Russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents, all in the same vicinity...and yes, he was a rageful one, indeed.

I also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments. Definitely pushing the Source engine to its absolute limits but doesn't go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game; the gameplay. The gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect, as you can easily navigate, along with the controls are fast and (sometimes) responsive, on the other hand, the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times, since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious, numbered team. Just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming, as it does help much more.

The original music used is also a big step up, as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match, each time around. From the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time, or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion, the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is. And with an added bonus, with the Steam music player at its peak in popularity, the update with the musical kit useable in-game was a great move, as you can listen to classic music, as you slaughter your opponents joyfully.

I've also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the real-life history and origin in a very formal, informative and creative way. The statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out, either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun, sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to second-hand pistols, when reloading your main gun that takes precious time, along with how they flesh out damage with a great, controlled accuracy. As you can tell, this game serves many different ideas, strategies, preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other.

And yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple, yet fast updates. The homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest CS:GO news, such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe, or special deal offers on those elusive cases, if you're ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins. You can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back.

But my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to be...the community. Yes, a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional, but I'm not talking about those great people. I'm talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunning-kruger affect; where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players, in a much more biased fashion. It gets annoying pretty quickly, so I would usually block the most revolting swines who do this.

All in all, this game is a big, big, big recommendation from me and if you think I'm lying, just check top-selling games list at the start of the Steam page. There's a reason why this game is on the high ranking list, and that's due to its high and successful popularity."

												Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues."

												Valve is not what it used to be. All Valve cares about is money. One case we don't need here, another one there. Valve has gone downhill, and I do not recommend this game. Money greedy devs, terrible community that will always flame you. I get that the skins are cosmetic. But instead of fixing the game and/or making it better, they make another case no one wants, operations are overdue (but it could be because Valve or the CS:GO Team is possibly making single-player stuff, and if they are, it better be good). I do not recommend this game unless you can handle the toxic community and money ♥♥♥♥♥ devs."

												Most cancerous and stressful game I've ever played

I have nothing against this game, I find it fun at times but I believe the title I choose above suits the game overall very well.

List of pro/con of this game:

Cons:
- There are a bunch of ragers in this game that rages whenever a round is lost, or you don't follow their command.
- There are a lot of salty and trash talkers in this game. Some teammates call you names from r*ta*d to f4g and whatever curse words you can think of.
- Sometimes teammates gang up to bully one teammate specifically because the teammate is ""ret4rd3d"" or ""bad"" player.


Pros:
- Fun if you're into competitive gaming. But be sure to be thick-skinned as I listed above, many ragers and salty people in this game.
- Skill-based game. Skins and levels do not give you advantages in this game.
- There is always something new to learn from new strategies to learning nade spots, gun spray control, etc. Even after hundreds or thousands of hours, there is always something new to learn."

												At its core Global Offensive/Counter Strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken Microsoft mouses.

The emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around. It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty hasn't been able to reproduce. On the outside Counter Strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned FPS gamer.

The game is simply tactful; it’s brilliant when you’re alive and even when you’re dead the game is still fun to watch other players.

Global offensive is a competitive game and a casual one, although for casual gamers it's probably better to find community servers over Valve servers. There's a huge market place now for the items in CS:GO and not only that, there's third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these in-game items have created

You will also find on Twitch CS:GO is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions, if you need any convincing watch a stream, watch a competitive match and see for yourself.

This game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library. Overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself."

												Community is the sickest, so here I have examples of any type of players:

Silver haters. The matchmaking system are combine players in accordance with the skill group. People have found it fun to create a general idea of silvers as a garbage without brains and skill. For someone it is an accurate description, but not for all. Ranks are not for showing off.

Boosted ones. They are too good for this world, they are smart, handsome and incredible. But Gold Nova 2. And they think their peoblem is always with teams that not_so_good. Eventually they are ruining games with their conceit and lack of experience. 

Skin haters. People that consider it's their business to count other people's money. Also, they are confident high price skins owners are bad because... IT IS FUN TO MAKE A MEME ""GE INVENTORY (pic with sand dunes) /SILVER INVENTORY (pic with knieves). Ha-haaa, dem memes...

BOT lovers. Some people think the BOT will be better than the player that didn't clutch the round with 10 hp left and all enemy team alive.

Common idiots. Actually press f1.

I WILL FIGHT TILL THE LAST BREATH ones. For some reason they never surrender. A competitive game is played between the teams of 5 players. If one of them leaves the game prematurely, he receives a penalty, and the team devoid of player has the right to end the game in advance. Valve gave them this feature, but they prefer to waste time and lose because of the numerical superiority of the enemy team.

Tryhards. Goes without any words :>

Team players you can count on. People that will give you info AND call idiot, noob, retard etc. at the same time, when they're already died and whatch you. They don't know what morale is. And manners.

The community most valuable members. They want to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral. This is not about CS:GO only. If you have a negative review, they hint you correctly you're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, that can't handle the game, even though you have 100% fair achievements. If you want to take part in a discussion, but don't know some things, they won't explain it, they are likely say ""go away"" instead. 

Ultimate pro gamers. For example: you lost the round 1 by 1 with the enemy, because couldn't handle aim? Dead one pro will cheer you with the words ""omg what an aim noob"" or something like that. I don't know where they take such a weird ideas of omnipotence or invincibility... Everyone have equal abilities here.

Smurfs. People that find it fun to play with people that can't resist. Welp, as you see, nothing in this community is friendly.

Russians. Do you think I forgot?) Russian ones are odd. They always ask this question ""Русские есть?"". This questions is very mystical, because even if they get positive answer... they keep silence. So, do you want to met... or you just show off your nationality? I know russian language and I know what russian think of USA* (English-speaking people=Americans*), they are not silent about it. 

Thank you for your attention. 
Now you know what Counter-Strike: Global Offending is."

												Maybe the only FPS where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill. No bullsh*t perks or kill streaks, no auto-turrets, no air strikes. If you want to win in Counter-Strike, you have to learn the maps, play smart, and have fast reflexes. Since you work for each and every kill, it's much more satisfying than other current gen shooters."

												I spent 400 bucks for nothing but blues
I still cant aim right
I almost never played outside of Dust 2
I had so many sleepless nights
I hate every country and all living beings
I havent improved , many mistakes I did
I have heard so many screams
I've been always AWP'd when going mid 
I knifed so many chickens
I played in servers with awful ticks
I saw women outside of the kitchen 
Oh wait, its just a pervert dude with girl pics
I got fps lows at the worst time
Lag when I wanted none
Many brazilians who were edgy to the line
All my pride is gone
And no matter how many rounds I beat
How cool I am in the middle of the heat
How many matches I win
I will never be Global Elite

Buy it to your friends, family and children beach."

												I don't know what to say about this game, so here is a recipe for pancakes, 

Ingredients:

4tbsp plain flour (about 100g)
1 large free range egg
½ pint semi-skimmed milk + water (about 300ml - ¾ milk ¼ water)
Pinch of salt
Butter for frying
How to make pancakes:
Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture.

Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.

In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter.

Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps.

Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!

Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.

Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.

Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.

Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).

Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!"

												Community is ruining this game. I live in Russia and happen to play on russian servers. This is incredibly awful experience i must say. Russians are the cancer of this game. They are everywhere and ruin the community and the game for others. I wish CSGO would cost like 30-50$ on Steam and that would definitely help to cut the amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in it. I wish there was an option to choose who to play with but again that wouldn't help because russians are everywhere. It saddnes me because i fed up with screaming kids and chavos and im quitting CSGO because of it. I can't enjoy the game while i have to listen to angry rednecks on the mic or screaming kids for 40-60 minutes. Despite the outcome of the match i still feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they trashtalk 24\7 and rarely able to play. ♥♥♥♥ this game.

PS. I must notice that there is like 5% of cool russians that know how to play and are actually nice but alot(not all ) of them are just ashamed to be russian so the hide their identity from others. These guys are a huge minority and this is truly sad."

												Beautiful game. First bullet accuracy of rifles is completely perfect, as is the miniscule RNG factor which doesn't affect anything at all.
Dedicated servers with more than 10 people don't have hit registration or choke/latency issues in the slightest.
Community is filled with mentally stable, rational, humble players dedicated to having fun while improving, not merely ranking up and flaming enemies and/or teammates. 
VAC is literally flawless on this game, never before have I encounted someone who I think twice about being absolutely 100% legitimate.
CS:GO developers have truly pruned this game into the best FPS of all time with their consistent efforts into listening to the community, bringing regular updates, game balancing patches and exciting new operations into Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Also goes well while coming down from a weeklong amphetamine induced psychosis. Never before has yelling at a computer game been so thrilling!"

												I only got this game because everyone literally forced me to get it, so I got it, I played it. It was good in the beginning, until I started playing competitive, and why is that?
Well as I walked into my first competitive match, I got into a match with 4 Russians on my team, and enemy team consisted of 3 Russians and 2 Americans that only spoke Russian. When the game started I walked 4 steps towards mid and got instantly sniped through doors, and that was a teammate! My team lost half their players before we met the enemy...So after that game I came to the conclusion that all the Russians wanted was to ♥♥♥♥ my ♥♥♥♥♥.

Pros:
+Great maps, especially when they're filled with Russians!
+I got A+ in Russian after owning this game for a week.
+I can now insult my friends in Russian because they don't understand ♥♥♥♥!
+I finally fit in(This review is more about my life than the actual game)

Cons:
-Russians, duh
-Russians with guns!
-democracy!!!
-Screaming Russians
-Not enough Russians

I wonder how many dislikes I can get by saying this?"

												The spiritual successor to ""The Secret of Monkey Island™"" (titled cs:go) is one of my personal favourite point and click adventures of all time; wether it's the engaging puzzles or intricate story, this game is always sure to provide hours upon hours of family friendly fun. the game's premise is that you're either a ""CT"" or a ""Counter-Troublemaker"" who's job is to stop the ""T's"" or ""Troublemaker's"" shenanigans, such as graffiti, egging houses, or the such. All these are of course now animated, comparative to the simplicity of  ""The Secret of Monkey Island™"". All in all, a great game and tons of fun. But it's kind of a rough port, and i'd reccomend purchase on ps3.

												I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn.
Another night of Insomnia.  

I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon™ HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus.

I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind. 

My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze.

I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia.

Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning.

My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished.

Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn.

The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room.

_


Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people.

Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway.

Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before.

I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value.

I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came.

The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow.

My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade.

I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head.

I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.7×28mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak™ display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words ""NOT ON MY WATCH"" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks.

Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed.

A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen.

Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long-  wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk.

_


Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice.  I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG;  9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself ""I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that gun"" while typing out ""#TAZED ♥♥♥♥♥"" in all chat.

Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. ""get rekt"" ""u suck"" ""TIME to die, amirite""

Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round.

From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will.

The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes.

Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a ""REKT"" holographic sticker and renamed ""Clockwork Ass♥♥♥♥ing"". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it.

Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never.

Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet.

Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to ♥♥♥♥ with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you.

I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall.

I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn.
Another night of Insomnia."

												I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons.

Firstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun.

Secondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more?

CS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience.

If you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades.

Until Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.)

EDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins.

ADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches.

Though I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers.

At first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches. 

@Shadowdance You're welcome. You gave me the push to write this reply.

Cheers fellow comrades."

												Both the competitive and guilty pleasure in my entire Steam library, CS:GO has captured both these conflictive aspects of mine spectacularly, as I've enjoyed over hundreds of hours, playing this joyous game. From the teamwork, player rankings, campaigns, competitive gameplay, music, replay value and much more, this game is a king amongst most modern, multi-player FPS' games and still going strong even over just a measly three years.

Just like its predecessors, the player assumes the role of either a counter-terrorist or a terrorist, both with their own unique missions, depending on the campaign in general. The newly added campaigns, Deathmatch and Arms race is a great exclusive extra if you're just a casual player, whereas there's the competitive session for the more experienced, intense and determined players out there.

With every match starting, you're brought into ''Freeze time.'' where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal, just ready to be bought, either with the money you've earned by killing opponents, or indeed losing a match respectively, still giving the losing team a winning chance. While with your team, you could stick together as there are power in numbers, or go alone to face your opposing enemies. I wouldn't talk for every individual player out there, as I've seen power in experienced players. Trust me, I have witnessed a Russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents, all in the same vicinity...and yes, he was a rageful one, indeed.

I also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments. Definitely pushing the Source engine to its absolute limits but doesn't go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game; the gameplay. The gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect, as you can easily navigate, along with the controls are fast and (sometimes) responsive, on the other hand, the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times, since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious, numbered team. Just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming, as it does help much more.

The original music used is also a big step up, as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match, each time around. From the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time, or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion, the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is. And with an added bonus, with the Steam music player at its peak in popularity, the update with the musical kit useable in-game was a great move, as you can listen to classic music, as you slaughter your opponents joyfully.

I've also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the real-life history and origin in a very formal, informative and creative way. The statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out, either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun, sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to second-hand pistols, when reloading your main gun that takes precious time, along with how they flesh out damage with a great, controlled accuracy. As you can tell, this game serves many different ideas, strategies, preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other.

And yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple, yet fast updates. The homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest CS:GO news, such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe, or special deal offers on those elusive cases, if you're ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins. You can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back.

But my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to be...the community. Yes, a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional, but I'm not talking about those great people. I'm talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunning-kruger affect; where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players, in a much more biased fashion. It gets annoying pretty quickly, so I would usually block the most revolting swines who do this.

All in all, this game is a big, big, big recommendation from me and if you think I'm lying, just check top-selling games list at the start of the Steam page. There's a reason why this game is on the high ranking list, and that's due to its high and successful popularity."

IF YOU DON'T WANT TO VIEW ALL MY REVIEW: DON'T BUY THE GAME ! NOT RECOMMENDED !
                                              
10 CAUSES WHY THE GAME IS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE:

1.Skins are getting uglier and uglier over time .
2.WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT MORE SKINS !
3.The FPS DROPS in the game are getting more and more..(As user with a good PC configuration i can say that firstly in 2014 the game was running on 350-500 FPS ! On max settings ! Now my PC is trying to run the game at 180-250 fps..
4.Cheaters everywhere !
5.Griefers everywhere !
6.Game is super buggy and glitchy !
7.Sounds are NOW RIDICILOUSLY AWFUL ! WE (THE PLAYERS) NOT ONLY MISS THE OLD SOUNDS,BUT WE REALLY WANT THEM BACK !!!
8.GAMBLING SITES ARE CLOSED ONLY BECAUSE VALVE CANNOT MAKE MONEY ,BECAUSE OF THEM !
9.THE NUKE MAP IS AWFUL !!!
10.VALVE ARE NOT LISTENING TO THE PLAYERS AND ARE ONLY TRYING TO MAKE MONEY !

So Valve please fix these things ! If you guys want these things to get fixed LIKE  or COMMENT below ,so VALVE can see this and hope they will fix it.
I am not trying to get likes or somethin i just really want the game as it was before.
Happy Christmas to everyone ! :)"

												Pros :
- Great teamplay if you have friends
- Updates to keep upgrading and improving the game
- Not being call of duty

Cons:
- Toxic community that makes CoD community feel like scholars ( occassionally )
- Hackers dnt get banned all the time even if its crystal clear
- Vague ranking system that seems not fair most of the time.
- I was legendary eagle and fell from grace due to ranking system update, its like getting a good grade after studying so hard, only for the teacher to decide to curve down all the grades becoz all the class passed.. its not fair, make ranking up harder but dnt screw the players
- Revolver.. really ? .. seriously.. why ?
- Overwatch not tempting
- Playing solo sucks
- The Idea of the campaign sucked big ♥♥♥
- Almost 2k hours and I dnt feel the game is rewarding me for my dedicated service.. give me a medal or smthng people :P
- I can't eat while playing.. big problem


As of April 7-2016 I retired from this game, its addictive like drugs.. left me frustrated alot, too many griefers and an increase in the number of hackers.. the type of hackers that smokes mid on d2 and takes out 5 guys with an awp inside the smoke.. that type of hackers.. Im focusing on finishing many games i left unplayed becoz i simply hunger for great stories"

												I had a lot of fun some years back in the 2012-2014 reaching the rank of Supreme mostly playing with friends but also as solo. I came back this year to try the game again after some absence from the scene. 


WTF has happened? 

This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.

DON'T GET ME WRONG HERE
I have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.

Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.

Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.

There is huge but in all this:

Are you willing to pay a subscription?
If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.

This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates. And this scenario this year doesn't happen for the first time."

												This was once the best game on Steam, until they dropped the ball. They created a juggernaut through skin drops which led to gambling and conjured the dark seedy side of the net. When it grew too big for its britches they cut off the gambling leaving everything in disarray. The games neglect was all too evident. All that remained was the crippled gameplay itself and websites that sold lifetime cheats and a terrible ranking system. Many will swear by this game but the truth is that the game is tied to a lifestyle of cheating and you are competing to become the best cheater. You are not to speak of this side of the game it is a not so secret club with a single rule, don't talk about it. That is the awful truth of CSGO where even pros are caught using hacks and major competitions are won by showcasing your unknown glitch. If this sounds great to you then this game will be a favorite for a long long time. After all Delta Force released in 1998 and people are still cheating in it right now. That's just a cold hard truth that the community wants to hide from their non cheating prey.

For the rest of us we have departed in search of greener pastures and memories of what was, for a time, an amazing game. As the market for skins continues to drop due to a lack of betting skins on matches, the last of the fair players will lose hope as reality sets in. This game will not extinguish quickly as the the majority of players purchased lifetime cheats and have multiple accounts. This becomes apparent as you get better and more people turn cheats on against you. This is called toggling as they turn their cheats on and off just often enough to win crucial rounds. You will hear people talking about toggling all of the time and people complaining that they are too obvious and offering tips to better conceal their deeds. After all cheaters are just a big happy family around here. There is no strategy worth the effort to counter people seeing through walls. Who do you think is going to rank up you playing legit or a wallbanger? With that in mind who do you think is ranking up if hardly anyone is caught? It is obvious right? 

If Steam ressurects gambling you may witness a resurgence but it is the loss of truly skilled and talented players that are the real story. Pro players voiced their frustrations over bugs and glitches only to be ignored. Valve released spray paint cans as some type of absurd diversion to the state of the game itself. 

This games community is a toxic pile of lies. If you choose to doubt me and embark on your own journey I invite you to read the novel John Henry. That will be you my friend, with your trusty slam hammer, competing against a machine until you die from exhaustion. Such is the state of the game and until sites aren't selling lifetime cheat memberships with timers showing they have been undiscovered for years... wtf ever I'm done with this game. If you like scammers buy this and watch as you are bombarded with phishing scams. You can convince others that I am wrong but after 750 hours on this game I am not listening to it another second.

The real ranking system:

Cheaters on top
Scammers in the middle
Legit players at the bottom

At no point will competition change as you will play the exact same people on different accounts no matter what ranking you are. It's just a big joke."

												Pros: 
-It's a huge e-sport

-very well done maps

-it has it's own weapons system that's very unique and adds an incredibly high learning curve.

-It keeps a classic arcade feel to the game so it's easy to pick up

The game has seen worse times, but even still, it's terribly flawed.

Cons:
-Unless you're playing in a LAN, where everyone is in the same room, you're going to have tons of hit registration problems.

-Valve's 64 tick servers are great for lower ranks from Silver to Master Guardian. But once you get past that, you've probably accumulated some skill and an understanding of the game and how it works. Quite often, while playing a competitive matchmaking, you'll shoot at someones head, see blood, and absolutely nothing will happen in your favor. 
128 tick servers exist, but you need to go to a third party to use them, which seems pretty excessive just to play the game with a few less problems.

-The community is the most toxic, vile, absurd- you know what. Just get a dictionary and every single word that has a negative connotation will pretty much describe the community that plays this game. 

-Hackers EVERYWHERE. Hackers are insanely abundant and carry on without a care in the world. They don't worry about getting banned because they have no problem buying the game again, especially if it goes on sale, and just hacking all over again. This is probably the biggest reason Valve doesn't do anything to REALLY try and put a stop to it. But why would they? It makes them money when someone finally does it get banned so who cares about the legit players who try to enjoy the game for what it is, right?

-There are a certain number of bugs and exploits that are in the game, that haven't ever really been addressed. For example, a persistant sound bug that sounds like someone is running when in fact nobody is there. (I believe they have fixed the running audio glitch but there are many more issues yet to be addressed.)

-The developers put out updates, and just when you think it's something useful, like fixing a bug or exploit that's been making the game unfair, they just add more sounds! Or adjust sound levels! Pretty much nothing that matters to serious players. 

Conclusion:
The game at its core is a decent game. But you can't play it the way it's 'meant' to be played with just the game itself. For actually decent servers, and a SLIGHTLY more tolerable community, you need to sign up with a third party website that hosts their own servers so you can play the game. But those matches don't count for anything in the game itself, it's pretty much just a platfom to work around. 

If you're going to get the game just for a time killer and don't plan to take it serious then great. But otherwise, don't waste your money or your time.

I manage(d) four community competetive servers that are fairly popular, and I used to have a blast playing on them. But now whenever I go into the servers, it usually ends in me having to ban the ENTIRE lobby. I've quite literally yelled about how tired I was of babysitting because that's exactly what I had to do. I'm very accustomed to seeing hackers and cheaters from monitoring so many for so long with my time on the servers so when I play matchmaking matches the hacks are very easy to spot out. 'Professional' players have been banned for hacking before for crying out loud.

The first few hundred hours of my gameplay were pretty fun. The learning curve made it challenging and different and that's what I enjoyed. But the higher rank you get and the more serious you play, the more terrible everything becomes. I've made it to Supreme Master First Class, (Rank before Global Elite, highest rank in the game's ranking system.) and I can't say that I want to bother trying to get Global or playing anymore in general. At this point, every other match has a hacker or at the very least a griefer or extremely toxic person that wants to spoil your day. Whether a hacker is blatant or not, it becomes pretty apparent when someone's playing unfairly. 

All in all, there's no sportmanship or respect in a game that would do extremely well with both of those things, and the lack of feedback from developers in helping clean up the community or create better servers is very unsettling, especially for one of the most popular games on Steam.

But you don't have to believe me, play the game and see for yourself. But you've been warned."

CSGO is a competitive team based shooter with highly refined mechanics

The Good:    (+) Gunplay is based on skill. Knowing how to control the rifle is the difference of winning or losing a gunfight.
    (+) All weapons are balanced in the sense that they each have a time, situation, or role that they should be used in.
    (+) Movement is fluid and precise and if mastered, can give you a competitive advantage.
    (+) The competitive maps have been tweaked specifically for competitive play in mind.
    (+) Competitive isn't the only game mode. There are also community servers which host a variety of game types that are fun and interesting.
    (+) Game overall takes skill to do well. It's not so easy to learn, and very difficult to master. This makes it pretty addicting when you're trying to improve your skills in the game.
    (+) Chickens.

The Bad:Honestly, there's not really anything negative about the game in my opinion. But I'll just address the common complaints of CSGO.
    (-) CSGO is hard. Seems like every bullet misses when you're aiming right at the guy. (This is where you would take the time to learn the game, but otherwise a common complaint from people.
    (-) Hit-reg is messed up. I always see the blood splatter but it never counts as a hit. (This is just a problem with the default 64 ticks server. You can join other servers with 128 tick to get better hit-reg anyways. It's still better than the 10 or 30 tick rate that Battlefield and Call of Duty has though.)

Well that's all the good and bad I could think of for CSGO.

Ack4orge Rating:10/10
Perfect
With the perfect tweaks to the gunplay, maps, movement, and gun balance, it refines the already highly refined gameplay of the past Counter-Strikes that's been out since 1999, making this one of the best competitive team-based first-person shooters on the market."

												I didn't know what to write about in my review, so here's a recipe on how to play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive instead:

1 Overpriced branded gaming mouse (best results with Razer)
1 Overpriced branded gaming keyboard (best results with Razer)
1 Giant mouse pad 50cm+ (because who the ♥♥♥♥ uses the imperial system)
1 144hz monitor (note: anything lower than 144hz will NOT work)
1 1/4 cups milk
1 Prebuilt Gaming computer (preferably one with a overpowered cpu and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gpu *cough* ayy lmaolienware *cough*
3 cans of phresh memes

Steps:
1. Set your screen ratio to 4:3 and to the lowest resolution possible so you can play like a pro
2. Buy a P90 and spam the keys A and D when shooting at someone
3. Reach Gold Nova 1 to make fun of silvers
5. Call everyone who is less skilled than you a filthy casual and a silver
6. Tell everyone who is more skilled than you to stop toggling and to go on a VACation
7. Steal your mum/dad's wallet and buy a knife and say you unboxed it. Optional University/College funds
8. Give up and go play on some Surf/Zombie servers 
9. Realise there is no Step 4"

												Last Update
Goodbye, CS:GO. You really helped me a lot on English : ) and buried me with ""Silver II, the Nu:B"" on my tombstone.

--------------------------------------------
Update 17/02/2015
Hey my foreign friends. Have fun in the Chinese Lunar new year! May the goat or sheep bless you and have a safe and sound 2015.

Update 1/31/2015
400 hours and I'm still Silver 2.
-------------------------------------------
Last Update before Christmas:
Kids are lovely. ""Carry us harder,"" he screamed.

However,

I'm just a lucky silver 2 with swag-7 and pro90.

I tried my best to give him the Christmas present, but I failed.

So sad.

------------------------------------------
Update something about racism.

Well....as an Asian, I encountered lots of racism assaults during the gameplay. 

I would just simply mute the racist and report him after the match, cuz I play this game for fun and practicing English, not arguing with other players...

Fortunately, most people are friendly and are willing to learn new things about Asia. Don't regard all the jokes as racism. I also made some friends online, people from East Europe, State people and Canadians.

Hope the world can develop in peace and go hell terrorism! Yes, that refers to you, ISIS. Go hell.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prefer it to Rising Storm, because it has a crosshair.

Prefer it to Tomb Raider, because I don't have to aim by holding R-mouse.

Prefer it to Call of Duty, because I would know how I died.

Playing CS:GO is a good way to practice English. 

Not suitable for foreign youngsters, because I learned lots of four letter word from this game."

												Once upon a time on de_inferno there existed a single chicken on A site.  ""I must get to my family!"" said the father chicken.  Navagating through all the stained karambits and battle-scarred asiimovs will prove quite the challenge.  As the chicken creeps up the stairs into apartments he sees the glass shatter in the first room to his right.  He scatters down the hallway anxious of what will happen next.  There are 3 mysterious people wearing potato sacks on their head and must have applied way too much eye shadow.  He sneaks past them and makes it into the crawlspace.  ""I can't believe it! I may actually live to see my family on B site fishing in the koi pond.""  AWP shots are being exchanged down the middle of the battlefield and the chicken hears flowerpots shattering here and there.  As he gets to the exit of crawlspace he sees another potatosack creature hiding behinds a haystack and scuttles down into banana.  ""Who the hell drove a taxi down here?"" says the chicken.  He makes it down the dark ally and glances over to see the remains of his family.  They are but feathers floating in the burnt sushi in the pond after a thrown molotov.  ""I.. I.... I can't belive thi-BOOM-.""  A cheeky CT sits in his spawn with an AWP as he giggles in his chair after murdering the poor creature in cold blood.  Please, I beg of you, these chickens are endangered creatures and risk thier lives to venture through the city just to meet thier family again.."

												Ok, I think is time for me to write a honest review for this game

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the most broken and unfair games I've ever played...
but I still love it

Why? well let me tell ya

I've had some many feelings while playing this game that I've never had before like desperation with anger, rage,  happiness, sadness, adrenaline, etc.

This game became a part of my life, I've met most of my best friends in this game, one of the most important relationships I had was built in this game. I've met every kind of person, the one that rages every second, the leader bottom frag, the Canadian, the Mexican, the Australian, the adult with kids, the kid, the furry, very nice people, the most annoying people I've ever met in my whole life, the smurf, the carry, the bad team, the great team, the ''grill'' and the list goes on.

Valve makes changes without any previous advice to the players, and they make changes to the very keys of the game, like the rank system, a whole map, the gun recoil, the sounds of every gun, the whole sound system of the game, prices of some in-game items, and the community usually gets mad at it at first, but we get used to it anyways.

What do I mean with ''unfair'' and ''broken''?
Well, in matchmaking (prime or non-prime) you're gonna find a smurf, a hacker, a whole queue of griefers, derankers etc,
Valve tries to stop this, but I personally feel they're giving up which is really annoying.

Another example for broken will be the rank system, is so weird and unfair for some players, when you're Nova II sometimes the other team could be Nova master or Silver elite, or a weird mix of those ranks, it took me around 160Hrs to get out of Silver after the rank system update, even if I had good perfomance, no rank up for a loooong time

If you're thinking about buying this game, you should totally start with a friend, is more fun in general, but if you're a very first time player joining a competitive game, I can't promise that your team is gonna be the most patient in that game, usually some players demand people that already know all the tactics and recoils, without knowing that you gotta start somewhere, but if you find a group of people that is patient and most important of all if they help you to improve your game, you should stick with them and play together more often. But don't think you'll always play with them, trust what I'm telling you, most of these people meet others and move on, but if you have a long term friendship with someone like that, you're incredebly lucky. 

now Datsuke, all those things doesn't sound very appealing

Well, maybe in paper they don't, but after experiencing a good game, after experiencing clean headshots, long range noscopes, carrying a team, a grenade kill, seeing a hacker getting VAC banned mid-game, clutching the round, getting a kill through the smoke, being called a ''hacker'' for your skill, laughing with your teammates is the most satisfying things ever, winning a close competitive game knowing that you perfom well gives you a huge feeling of success making you play more and more. Besides, you meet very different people, you listen a new accent every day, you learn a new word or a internet term every day, you learn something new in general. Other thing I love about this game is that, learning, there's always something new to learn in every map, every gun, a new position, a new boost spot, a new flash, a new smoke, a new prefire spot. I have 1,400Hrs right now of play time, and I think I don't even know the half of the smokes in Mirage. 

So yea, this game is really good, most of the time, you're gonna see yourself ragging every now and then, but personally I think is worth it

												How Comp. in CS:GO works
> You're so happy, your entire team is made up of Russians, you know since they are Russian they must be good
> You're winning 13:0, so excited, going to get a 16:0
> Enemy team wins one round. Calm down, you'll get them next time!
> Enemy team wins
> Exit CS:GO
> Uninstall CS:GO

How Casual in CS:GO works
> Everyone on team dies from the ""hacker"" AWP that keeps killing you
> Last guy with 0 kills and 6 deaths is alive
> Know you're gonna lose this
> Last guy kills everyone on other team


How unboxing works
> Buy a few keys, open something decent
> Get cocky, unboxed 1 decent thing, you must be lucky!
> Unbox a worthless skin
> Take deep breaths, try again
> Get the exact same skin as before
> Cry as you steal your mothers credit card and spend $500 dollars on keys and crates
> Unbox nothing good
> Uninstall CS:GO and swear to never play it again, saying ""Idi Nahui"" from all the Russians to your screen

> Install a week later

CS:GO is the best game ever."

												I wasted so much time in this game,yes the game is good but the community is crap,I used to be DMG.
Let me describe what happened to me(and probably a lot of csgo players)
1.got into a match,got a team of 4 russians,they kicked me cause I didn't speak vodka language
2.got downranked for getting kicked
3.played a few matches in MGE hoping to get to DMG fast,won 5 games in a row and then lost 3 games in a row
4.got downranked for loosing 3 matches in a row
5.started up csgo once again,as mg2,got into a match,got gangbanged by some random turkish guys with walls(I even checked the replay)
6.I made this review and uninstalled the game
(I still think this is a great game,but the EU servers are filled with human waste and there is no point of even trying to have some fun while playing)"

You get back on the next day and go through the same roll of ♥♥♥♥ again and you do it with a smile.. at least when you start.

That my friends is a game that will carry on with you forever."

CSGO is a competitive team based shooter with highly refined mechanics

The Good:    (+) Gunplay is based on skill. Knowing how to control the rifle is the difference of winning or losing a gunfight.
    (+) All weapons are balanced in the sense that they each have a time, situation, or role that they should be used in.
    (+) Movement is fluid and precise and if mastered, can give you a competitive advantage.
    (+) The competitive maps have been tweaked specifically for competitive play in mind.
    (+) Competitive isn't the only game mode. There are also community servers which host a variety of game types that are fun and interesting.
    (+) Game overall takes skill to do well. It's not so easy to learn, and very difficult to master. This makes it pretty addicting when you're trying to improve your skills in the game.
    (+) Chickens.

The Bad:Honestly, there's not really anything negative about the game in my opinion. But I'll just address the common complaints of CSGO.
    (-) CSGO is hard. Seems like every bullet misses when you're aiming right at the guy. (This is where you would take the time to learn the game, but otherwise a common complaint from people.
    (-) Hit-reg is messed up. I always see the blood splatter but it never counts as a hit. (This is just a problem with the default 64 ticks server. You can join other servers with 128 tick to get better hit-reg anyways. It's still better than the 10 or 30 tick rate that Battlefield and Call of Duty has though.)

Well that's all the good and bad I could think of for CSGO.

Ack4orge Rating:10/10
Perfect
With the perfect tweaks to the gunplay, maps, movement, and gun balance, it refines the already highly refined gameplay of the past Counter-Strikes that's been out since 1999, making this one of the best competitive team-based first-person shooters on the market."

												Seems like Valve has completely forgotten about this game. After 2.5k hours + I can honestly say it is one of the best games I have ever played. However, now I'm at the top end of the game, you struggle to find a legit game where there isn't any cheaters. You have to go to third party websites which charge monthly to play without cheaters, and even then there is still the odd few. So if you're a casual gamer looking for a time wasting game this is for you, however if you're willing to invest thousands of hours into this game to try and reach the top I wouldn't recommend it until Valve sorts out their anti-cheat (Which will never happen).

Keep adding Stat-Trak music kits and gloves to a 64-tick broken game Valve."

												The game is a money pit filled with hackers. 
The rank system is a joke.
Overwatch is a joke.
VAC is a joke.
There is no anti-cheat system for this game.
It has a tired engine. (12+ yrs)
It's a game based off a skill game. Just when you master a skill or skills they just throw in another broke update
 and break more crap like changing the whole gun skill set (joke)

Adding the R8, A gun never in any Counter Strike, Is maybe all you need to know about the brain trust behind the game anymore. Best idea ever !  (Not)
I know lets add Flintlocks,Muzzleloaders,Catapult and Slingshots.

They will claim to fix things like broke spawns (Dust DM spawn) still broke !

DM (Deathmatch) has the Worst spawns of any game i have ever seen.
After one of the great updates you will have to play through weeks of people who have pings from another planet.
Random lag spikes or micro stutters, do to it's not optimized well.
Could it be a good game ? yes ! If they had someone who had a brain and played it and then fixed it and left it alone 
 other then adding the money making garbage (I know you only care if it's a cash cow).
Legit players suffer while hackers roam free. (I know you don't care cause you make more money) not banning people 
 hence people having so many accounts...

I have 1 account and proud of it.

I know people will hate on me and I don't care it's the truth.......

By the way i'd spend more money through Steam but after seeing what this game has turned out to be and the stupid taxes crap from selling the junk I get from game (not real money by the way, The real money has already been taxed) and the lack of caring about hackers.    "" I'll just save it"".

If your a legit player wanting to learn the game and enjoy the game you will be disappointed and penalized.
If you a hacker or a scammer you will love this game and be rewarded.....


If you look at most of the positive reviews they are from people who have close to no hours played.
If you look at the negative reviews they are from people who put a lot of time into the game.


(1/7/15 update)  They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...!


For all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours.
I've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players.
If it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do.
And yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore.......
As soon as my friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....!

""I never leave a friend or a man behind"" (In other words I don't bail on my friends)


After reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should.

If this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system ""Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money""  people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played !
This game would be great........
 There is a Mute/Block for thoses who don't want to know how many times your mom has had sex with a 12 yr old. 
But 90% of everyone you face has brand new account and has the reflexes of god and X-Ray vision of Superman. No one gets banned. Hackers will say ""I heard you"" or it's ""my smurf"". In any case if your Global and on another account and play as a global on a nova account then your a cheater and a scumbag.



The Facts and nothing but the facts........!

												Must buy if you love FPS games!

This game is all about personal progression, since it comes with a high learning curve, it's not about unlocking some stupid grip or scope for your gun. It's about you, that has to learn.

The game is updated almost once a week with new features and content, Match Making is great when you are playing with friends.

The real game for people that love to play competitively, with a team or just solo.
 
There are also casual game modes available for the people that don't like to play competitively, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, Hostage and Defusual missions which can be played on casual style, or mostly known as public or community servers. These modes are great to learn the game, and improve your play.


Pros.
◘ Match Making.
◘ Skill levels and ranks, play against players of your own skill level.
◘ Competitive scene, with ladders and tournaments.
◘ The CS feeling, transition from older CS games to CS:GO isn't that hard.
◘ Most old maps from CS, are in the game.
◘ No perks and other unnecessary clutter.
◘ Great spectator sport, easily to understand and interesting to watch!
◘ No pay to win model, all items are purely cosmetic.


Cons.
◘ Match Making 64 tick servers stability could be improved.
◘ Game could use some optimization here and there.
◘ Cheaters now and then, but that's online gaming for you.

If you are looking to improve your aim skills, try out these maps.

												This was once the best game on Steam, until they dropped the ball. They created a juggernaut through skin drops which led to gambling and conjured the dark seedy side of the net. When it grew too big for its britches they cut off the gambling leaving everything in disarray. The games neglect was all too evident. All that remained was the crippled gameplay itself and websites that sold lifetime cheats and a terrible ranking system. Many will swear by this game but the truth is that the game is tied to a lifestyle of cheating and you are competing to become the best cheater. You are not to speak of this side of the game it is a not so secret club with a single rule, don't talk about it. That is the awful truth of CSGO where even pros are caught using hacks and major competitions are won by showcasing your unknown glitch. If this sounds great to you then this game will be a favorite for a long long time. After all Delta Force released in 1998 and people are still cheating in it right now. That's just a cold hard truth that the community wants to hide from their non cheating prey.

For the rest of us we have departed in search of greener pastures and memories of what was, for a time, an amazing game. As the market for skins continues to drop due to a lack of betting skins on matches, the last of the fair players will lose hope as reality sets in. This game will not extinguish quickly as the the majority of players purchased lifetime cheats and have multiple accounts. This becomes apparent as you get better and more people turn cheats on against you. This is called toggling as they turn their cheats on and off just often enough to win crucial rounds. You will hear people talking about toggling all of the time and people complaining that they are too obvious and offering tips to better conceal their deeds. After all cheaters are just a big happy family around here. There is no strategy worth the effort to counter people seeing through walls. Who do you think is going to rank up you playing legit or a wallbanger? With that in mind who do you think is ranking up if hardly anyone is caught? It is obvious right? 

If Steam ressurects gambling you may witness a resurgence but it is the loss of truly skilled and talented players that are the real story. Pro players voiced their frustrations over bugs and glitches only to be ignored. Valve released spray paint cans as some type of absurd diversion to the state of the game itself. 

This games community is a toxic pile of lies. If you choose to doubt me and embark on your own journey I invite you to read the novel John Henry. That will be you my friend, with your trusty slam hammer, competing against a machine until you die from exhaustion. Such is the state of the game and until sites aren't selling lifetime cheat memberships with timers showing they have been undiscovered for years... wtf ever I'm done with this game. If you like scammers buy this and watch as you are bombarded with phishing scams. You can convince others that I am wrong but after 750 hours on this game I am not listening to it another second.

The real ranking system:

Cheaters on top
Scammers in the middle
Legit players at the bottom

At no point will competition change as you will play the exact same people on different accounts no matter what ranking you are. It's just a big joke."

												I can't rate it 10/10 because the tenth player never joins
I can't rate it 9/10 because out of the 10 players in a match, only 1 speaks english
I can't rate it 8/10 because only 2 people on your team know how to use a weapon that is not a P90
I can't rate it 7/10 because it doesnt matter how good you are, 3 people on your team will yell at you.
I can't rate it 6/10 because the rest of the 4 players on your team won't shut up when you are last one alive
I can't rate it 5/10 because the 5 players on the enemy team are either too good, or really ♥♥♥♥ing bad.
I can't rate it 4/10 because 4 people rushed B and none survived..
I can't rate it 3/10 because valve doesn't like anything that has to do with 3, and will take down this review
I can't rate it 2/10 because only 2 team mates know call outs, but half of the time in a different language.
I can't rate it 1/10 because that is my k/d ratio
I can't rate it 0/10 because 0 people in the discussion forums have any sort of common sense, yet they still correct each others grammar mistakes

So I rate it an 11 out of 10 because its a game I keep coming back to."

EDIT: it has been years and the devs do not update the game with iron sights or a sprint feature...

EDIT2: I have finally reached global elite but I see no option to reset my rank and start over. Is this happening to anyone else?

EDIT3: I cant set a loadout when i go into a game. I also cant see any perks. Glitch?

EDIT4: After 3000 hours i finally got my 100th awp kill, but did not unlock an attachment for the weapon. Do i need 150 kills? I just want extended mags honestly.

EDIT5: I decided to get some skins, but they are not adding any stat boosts to my guns.  Where is the microtransaction to add stats?"

												This review will probably trigger butthurts because it's going to focus on the positive things I have to say about the game, you have been warned. Global Offensive (CSGO) is the latest addition to the Counter-Strike franchise and it's also the best-selling one so far. I believe that there are four reasons for it's main success. 

The first reason is primarily because it greats new players well to an environment already filled with veterans. A great example is the games matchmaking system for competitive players which places you with others that are the same skill level. It seems to work very well from my experience, but it's definitely more comfortable to play with friends (just like any other team-based multiplayer game).

The second reason is how well they managed to implement new weapons and features to the game without destroying it's original charm. It's still the same game from 1999 but with slightly more diversity and variation which enhances the experience. The physics of the game adds more depth overall and allows you to throw coordinated smokes and other grenades which adds another layer of gameplay. 

The third reason is that watching professional teams and matches is engaging and fun. The built-in tools for spectating like for example x-ray makes it very easy to understand, even for someone that doesn't play the game. And yes, you will often find e-sport fans that prefer watching rather than playing because of the viewer satisfaction you get.

The fourth reason (and this is a big one) is the ability to customize your items appearance, thanks to a community driven workshop and marketplace. A vast majority of the community is busy buying and selling skins and other cosmetics because it can actually become profitable in the long-run, and uses real money.

You will get weekly or monthly updates which usually add, change or fix features, and sometimes an operation which introduces items and maps made partly by the developers, but more importantly by the community. Even if the game is heavily criticized by most, I still see it's charm for being what it is and I recommend this to anyone that likes team-based shooters.

TL;DR 

Game matches your skill with others, it has new weapons and features compare to the older releases while still retaining it's originial charm, watching a proffesional match is fun and there's a marketplace with virtual items that you can buy/sell/trade for real money.

If you want tips and tricks, I have a YouTube channel where I focus on tutorials:

												This game has been planned perfectly. 

Gabe's plan has worked perfectly.

I have unboxed around 3,400 cases so far and gotten 12 knives.
I have spent around $16,000 on this game so far and still play like ♥♥♥♥.
I have played over 300 competitive matches and am still a Silver.
Every matchmaking team I get is a team of Russians who like saying ""♥♥♥♥♥"" and have a grudge against Obama and have a microphone that sounds like a cat trying to gargle shards of glass.

I will keep on unboxing cases, playing like a handicapped person, stay on Silver and keep buying expensive skins that apparently are supposed to make me better but don't. 

Because after all, Gabe is love, Gabe is life."

												I didn't know what to write about in my review, so here's a recipe on how to play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive instead:

1 Overpriced branded gaming mouse (best results with Razer)
1 Overpriced branded gaming keyboard (best results with Razer)
1 Giant mouse pad 50cm+ (because who the ♥♥♥♥ uses the imperial system)
1 144hz monitor (note: anything lower than 144hz will NOT work)
1 1/4 cups milk
1 Prebuilt Gaming computer (preferably one with a overpowered cpu and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gpu *cough* ayy lmaolienware *cough*
3 cans of phresh memes

Steps:
1. Set your screen ratio to 4:3 and to the lowest resolution possible so you can play like a pro
2. Buy a P90 and spam the keys A and D when shooting at someone
3. Reach Gold Nova 1 to make fun of silvers
5. Call everyone who is less skilled than you a filthy casual and a silver
6. Tell everyone who is more skilled than you to stop toggling and to go on a VACation
7. Steal your mum/dad's wallet and buy a knife and say you unboxed it. Optional University/College funds
8. Give up and go play on some Surf/Zombie servers 
9. Realise there is no Step 4"

												I came to this game for my fetish of chickens.  When playing the  game,  I realised that not every map has chickens on it, so I slowly got angrier with the game... The lack of chickens boiled my blood. CSGO made me angry, Until, I found my dream love, Deathmatch. A Chicken on any map, right then.. I'd kick the bots, and chase  the chickens around for hours. Ah, It was so pleasurable, How I would do it for hours on end. The chickens are perfect.  I play this game for hours on end, and the chickens never disapointment me now,  Oh Chickens, how you are my one true love. I can't focus at school anymore..  I only think about chickens, on the way home from school there is a KFC, I walk past it every day, I think of chickens, One time, I literally stopped, and took a fap to one of the  chickens. Ah,  It was so good. 
Chickens
I love them
Oh Chickens

												I don't know what to say about this game, so here is a recipe for pancakes, 

Ingredients:

4tbsp plain flour (about 100g)
1 large free range egg
½ pint semi-skimmed milk + water (about 300ml - ¾ milk ¼ water)
Pinch of salt
Butter for frying
How to make pancakes:
Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture.

Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.

In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter.

Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps.

Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!

Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.

Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.

Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.

Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).

Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!"

												Main Review 
This review is carefully worded explanation on my 'departure' from CS:GO and why in its current state, I would not recommend the game. This is somewhat lengthy, so it is really down to you whether or not you actually decide to read it all. 

So, where do I begin? Well, after reaching the second highest matchmaking rank (Supreme Master First Class) in October 2015 and continuing to play CS:GO from there on throughout 2016, I can say I've had a lot of experience with the game. In that time, I've clocked 1.3k hours and have seen a lot of changes. It's funny really, when I consider the very beginning. For my very first MM rank, I successfully achieved Silver 1. That day I was so excited, only to find out it was the lowest rank there is. Yeah, that sort of sucked. That's not something that deterred me though, because back then, I found enjoyment out of the game and saw a lot of potential that made me want to fight to the top. 

So, what exactly happened which took that enjoyment away? During 2016, I continued to play competitive CS, that being through regular MM, Faceit or even some ESEA. The difference from 2015-2016, is that in 2016, I began to often take breaks. These 'breaks' often came as a result of several angry occasions where I was confronted by the issues surrounding CS. Those issues are mostly the obvious ones everyone knows about, such as the increasing amount of cheaters, lack of necessary updates, hit registration, community etc.

The issues are something I wish to look more deeply into. Alongside hit registration, there is the problem of accuracy as a whole. The fact that you can have an AWP positioned on a players head and somehow 'miss' the shot, yet a player can running headshot you with a pistol is just insane. Further speaking about cheaters, there is the fact nothing is done to truly stop them. The developers of the game are greedy and they know how cheaters can be of benefit to them. When the time comes for a cheater to finally get banned, they can just go pay to get the game once more on another account. Within an hour or so of being banned, they are straight back. That's not the only instance of them being greedy. Take the graffiti update as an example. Instead of focusing on the game breaking issues, they add paints. Now, this brought a lot a nostalgia. Of course though, the first paint you recieve is awful and you have to go purchase more in order to have something that looks good. The limited use feature that prevents you having a graffiti spray for more than 50 uses just further proves of how hungry they are for money. A last point I wish to mention, is that I cannot forget about the unbelievably toxic community. I do respect this one is difficult to control though. 

Even despite all these game problems, I always managed to return to CS:GO. The reasons for this, as follows, were boredom, the fact that I was not too bad of a player or after I watched a Pro/YouTuber perform really well. These factors gave me the naive idea that I could once again gain enjoyment out of the game. That idea was soon shattered every time, when I was reminded of the state of the game and how it hasn't improved on any of the given issues. Huge attention comes to the game through the eSports scene or the regular community, however nothing changes. 

In order to put an end to the cycle I got myself in of leaving and returning, I promised to quit CS:GO for good in order to enjoy other games and activities outside gaming. I certainly had a fun time in playing CS:GO, however the increasing issues, lack of attention towards issues and the fact the communities voice is not heard, has currently killed the game for me. Who knows where things will go in the future with this game? I hope things may look up. 

Side note - I find it very amusing that so many of the positive reviews are full of content that is negative about the game. 

TL;DR - Quit CS:GO because of cheaters, greedy developers, toxic community, accuracy issues, lack of motivation etc.

Small Update - 12/12/16 
In an attempt to avoid any comments calling me 'hypocritical', although I will still most likely receive them, I am adding this update. Just now, I have reinstalled CS, this now being a month down the line since having it uninstalled. Whilst I have got the game back again, this review is still relevant as my views about the game have not really changed. The simple reason for me getting this game once more, is the fact I have been requested by many to play. Through requests, I have made the choice to maybe play with some friends here and there if they need the extra player. Chances are my enjoyment on the game will still be low and I do not intend to play this game regularly."

												Let me preface this just a bit.

I love Counter-Strike. I've met so many cool people over the years I've played, had so many laughs and good times, it's been a blast. However, I'd say about 95% of that was purely through casual. 

So after 500+ hours in the game, I decided to try and get into the competitive scene. I got a few buddies together and we were gradually progressing through the silver ranks (I know call me bad, ♥♥♥♥, etc.) and we were having good fun. We'd win 3, lose 1, but the point was that it was fun.

However, as we got higher and higher up, it stopped being fun. The reason? Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ poor matchmaking and security from Valve's end. I can understand one bad game or 2, but it got to the point where it was consitently terrible. At this point I had stopped queing with less than a full lobby. Me and a couple friends would get qued up with people with 900 ping who were basically worse than bots, they'd leave, and then its a 3v5 for the entire match. Experiences like this, are not fun, at all. 

The worst part though, is the amount of painfully obvious hackers in this game. VAC is the poorest ♥♥♥♥ing excuse for an anti-cheat system I've ever seen. One hacker will basically carry an entire team, and 9/10 times the enemy team won't have the integrity to kick the blatant hacker, because he'll carry them to the next rank. The most you can do is report them, but with how cheap this game is, it's no problem for people to make another account and rinse-repeat. 

Valve makes more than enough money on this game to justify having a better anti-cheat system. It is honestly one of the saddest examples of a company not giving a ♥♥♥♥ about their community that I can think of in the gaming industry. Say what you want about EA being a money hungry ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company that hates their fans, I guarantee you that you won't run into as many hackers on official Dice Battlefield servers than you will an official CSGO server. That's just sad. 

Again, I love this game. If you want to play casual or community or what have you, you'll probably have a great time learning the quirks of the game, learning the maps, and engaging with the goofy ♥♥♥ community I've come to love/hate. However, the competitive scene is pure cancer. I do hope that Valve reads these, even though I highly doubt it, because I truly want what's best for this game. 

Tks for reading.

												I spent 400 bucks for nothing but blues
I still cant aim right
I almost never played outside of Dust 2
I had so many sleepless nights
I hate every country and all living beings
I havent improved , many mistakes I did
I have heard so many screams
I've been always AWP'd when going mid 
I knifed so many chickens
I played in servers with awful ticks
I saw women outside of the kitchen 
Oh wait, its just a pervert dude with girl pics
I got fps lows at the worst time
Lag when I wanted none
Many brazilians who were edgy to the line
All my pride is gone
And no matter how many rounds I beat
How cool I am in the middle of the heat
How many matches I win
I will never be Global Elite

Buy it to your friends, family and children beach."

												Valve is not what it used to be. All Valve cares about is money. One case we don't need here, another one there. Valve has gone downhill, and I do not recommend this game. Money greedy devs, terrible community that will always flame you. I get that the skins are cosmetic. But instead of fixing the game and/or making it better, they make another case no one wants, operations are overdue (but it could be because Valve or the CS:GO Team is possibly making single-player stuff, and if they are, it better be good). I do not recommend this game unless you can handle the toxic community and money ♥♥♥♥♥ devs."

												If you want the most frustrating experience of your entire life , you should start playing CS:GO , don't get me wrong  the ideea and the graphics are good , but , the ♥♥♥♥ing developers dosen't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about the community , how it is possible for smaller companies , indie developers and soo on , to listen to the needs of the players , but a ♥♥♥♥ing 3.5 billion $ company can't , because they don;t give a shiit, about us ,that's why ,  they only care about the ♥♥♥♥ing money , oo we have 64 tick rate servers , a lot of lag , and problems with the servers but , we are ♥♥♥♥ing updating the sounds 3 times in like 4-5 months , and it's ♥♥♥♥ing unreal what's happening , for exemple look at Esea they are taking 1 Month @ $6.95 but at least you are playing on 128 tick rate servers , how , it is possible for them but for ♥♥♥♥ing Valve not ? i have a lot of questions , i'm very disappointed , and i hate to say it , but the community is leaving you , it's the same story as  Dota 2 , they can't listen to the simple and important needs of the players that play the games , that pay and invest  a loot of money , it's sad ...Sorry for the long post , and sorry for my english too , Have a nice day/ night everyone"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

												I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn.
Another night of Insomnia.  

I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon™ HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus.

I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind. 

My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze.

I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia.

Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning.

My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished.

Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn.

The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room.

_


Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people.

Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway.

Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before.

I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value.

I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came.

The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow.

My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade.

I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head.

I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.7×28mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak™ display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words ""NOT ON MY WATCH"" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks.

Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed.

A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen.

Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long-  wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk.

_


Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice.  I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG;  9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself ""I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that gun"" while typing out ""#TAZED ♥♥♥♥♥"" in all chat.

Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. ""get rekt"" ""u suck"" ""TIME to die, amirite""

Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round.

From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will.

The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes.

Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a ""REKT"" holographic sticker and renamed ""Clockwork Ass♥♥♥♥ing"". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it.

Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never.

Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet.

Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to ♥♥♥♥ with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you.

I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall.

I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn.
Another night of Insomnia."

												You want buy this game ? 
I'm gonna show you somes tips for playing :
- Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test. 
- The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. 
- When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. 
- Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. 
- You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. 
- Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. 
- VAC is a good anti cheat. 
- Skins make you better at the game. 
- When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. 
- Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. 
- Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. 
- If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. 
- When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! 
- Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 
50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. 
- State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. 
- Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) 
- If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. 
- Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot.
- If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. 
- The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. 
- Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. 
- You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip! 
What the ♥♥♥♥ is strategy?"

Comment written after 1600 hours played this game...
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO VIEW ALL MY REVIEW: DON'T BUY THE GAME ! NOT RECOMMENDED !
                                              
10 CAUSES WHY THE GAME IS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE:

1.Skins are getting uglier and uglier over time .
2.WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT MORE SKINS !
3.The FPS DROPS in the game are getting more and more..(As user with a good PC configuration i can say that firstly in 2014 the game was running on 350-500 FPS ! On max settings ! Now my PC is trying to run the game at 180-250 fps..
4.Cheaters everywhere !
5.Griefers everywhere !
6.Game is super buggy and glitchy !
7.Sounds are NOW RIDICILOUSLY AWFUL ! WE (THE PLAYERS) NOT ONLY MISS THE OLD SOUNDS,BUT WE REALLY WANT THEM BACK !!!
8.GAMBLING SITES ARE CLOSED ONLY BECAUSE VALVE CANNOT MAKE MONEY ,BECAUSE OF THEM !
9.THE NUKE MAP IS AWFUL !!!
10.VALVE ARE NOT LISTENING TO THE PLAYERS AND ARE ONLY TRYING TO MAKE MONEY !

So Valve please fix these things ! If you guys want these things to get fixed LIKE  or COMMENT below ,so VALVE can see this and hope they will fix it.
I am not trying to get likes or somethin i just really want the game as it was before.
Happy Christmas to everyone ! :)"

												Community is the sickest, so here I have examples of any type of players:

Silver haters. The matchmaking system are combine players in accordance with the skill group. People have found it fun to create a general idea of silvers as a garbage without brains and skill. For someone it is an accurate description, but not for all. Ranks are not for showing off.

Boosted ones. They are too good for this world, they are smart, handsome and incredible. But Gold Nova 2. And they think their peoblem is always with teams that not_so_good. Eventually they are ruining games with their conceit and lack of experience. 

Skin haters. People that consider it's their business to count other people's money. Also, they are confident high price skins owners are bad because... IT IS FUN TO MAKE A MEME ""GE INVENTORY (pic with sand dunes) /SILVER INVENTORY (pic with knieves). Ha-haaa, dem memes...

BOT lovers. Some people think the BOT will be better than the player that didn't clutch the round with 10 hp left and all enemy team alive.

Common idiots. Actually press f1.

I WILL FIGHT TILL THE LAST BREATH ones. For some reason they never surrender. A competitive game is played between the teams of 5 players. If one of them leaves the game prematurely, he receives a penalty, and the team devoid of player has the right to end the game in advance. Valve gave them this feature, but they prefer to waste time and lose because of the numerical superiority of the enemy team.

Tryhards. Goes without any words :>

Team players you can count on. People that will give you info AND call idiot, noob, retard etc. at the same time, when they're already died and whatch you. They don't know what morale is. And manners.

The community most valuable members. They want to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral. This is not about CS:GO only. If you have a negative review, they hint you correctly you're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, that can't handle the game, even though you have 100% fair achievements. If you want to take part in a discussion, but don't know some things, they won't explain it, they are likely say ""go away"" instead. 

Ultimate pro gamers. For example: you lost the round 1 by 1 with the enemy, because couldn't handle aim? Dead one pro will cheer you with the words ""omg what an aim noob"" or something like that. I don't know where they take such a weird ideas of omnipotence or invincibility... Everyone have equal abilities here.

Smurfs. People that find it fun to play with people that can't resist. Welp, as you see, nothing in this community is friendly.

Russians. Do you think I forgot?) Russian ones are odd. They always ask this question ""Русские есть?"". This questions is very mystical, because even if they get positive answer... they keep silence. So, do you want to met... or you just show off your nationality? I know russian language and I know what russian think of USA* (English-speaking people=Americans*), they are not silent about it. 

Thank you for your attention. 
Now you know what Counter-Strike: Global Offending is."

												It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory.

You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own.

Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fu­ck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP.

You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b.

Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods.

You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'.

												Who needs Gloves? Who needs 10 different cases? Valve is just a money hungry company trying to take money from people that hold this game alive. We need 128 Tick servers, We need new Anit-Cheatsoftware. We need better Steam Support and not thos freking gloves, knifes, skins. I myself will stop putting anymore money in this game, and so should you. Stop playing on official mm servers, go to esea, cevo, faceit, esl. 
sincerly, 
a dedicated player who loves the game"

BOT Seth will find you.
BOT Seth will see you through walls.
BOT Seth will shoot you through walls.
You cannot run.
You cannot hide.
You cannot win.
BOT Seth will kill you. And if you kill him, he will come back. 

Your only way to escape the curse is to leave and hope he is not in your next round.

												CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.

In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.

The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.

Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.

There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO."

												I used to recommend this game but I can't anymore. CS:GO is broken in a number of important ways right now: 

Pistols desperately need balance. 
Netcode and servers are horrible.
VAC essentially only catches the dumbest hackers. 
Overwatch more or less an admission that VAC doesn't work well but is also useless. 
Movement speed and run-and-gun gameplay style completely at odds with theme of tactical shooter. 
Tapping often offers little reward for risk in current spray meta (exception being AK at distance).
Jumping accuracy? ... Really? Why encourage jumping in a tactical shooter? SWEET REPLAYS!!!
R8 revolver... feels like an April fool's joke that never ended and now is just sort of a troll gun.
Non-Prime matchmaking a huge deterrent to new players - testing ground for hackers now. 
Prime matchmaking seems like an awkward fix to broken VAC and honestly still plenty of walls/etc.
Smokes still frequently glitch allowing players on one side to see through them.

I won't list toxic community as a negative of the game because there's nothing the developer can do about that. For all of you who want to cite Riot Games' efforts to improve player behaviour ask yourself this one question: have their efforts worked? No. League of Legends has the most toxic player environment I've experienced even compared to CS:GO or Dota2. Competitive games bring out the worst in a lot of people. That's a people problem not a developer problem. 

Anyway, in its current form I would not say that spending the considerable time to become skilled at this game is worth it as you will constantly be let down by wonky mechanics, bad servers, and the inescapable reality that there is a constant ebb and flow of hackers in competitive that make any sense of true competition feel absent. 

All in all, CSGO will have you asking yourself: am I having fun or is this actually adding negativity and stress to my life? The answer will vary from game to game but in the long run I think most people play this game out of habit rather than having a consistently positive experience."

												In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in. 

When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body. 

The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money.

Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend.

In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a ""Hostage Rescue Kit"", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders. 

Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up."

												Let me preface this just a bit.

I love Counter-Strike. I've met so many cool people over the years I've played, had so many laughs and good times, it's been a blast. However, I'd say about 95% of that was purely through casual. 

So after 500+ hours in the game, I decided to try and get into the competitive scene. I got a few buddies together and we were gradually progressing through the silver ranks (I know call me bad, ♥♥♥♥, etc.) and we were having good fun. We'd win 3, lose 1, but the point was that it was fun.

However, as we got higher and higher up, it stopped being fun. The reason? Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ poor matchmaking and security from Valve's end. I can understand one bad game or 2, but it got to the point where it was consitently terrible. At this point I had stopped queing with less than a full lobby. Me and a couple friends would get qued up with people with 900 ping who were basically worse than bots, they'd leave, and then its a 3v5 for the entire match. Experiences like this, are not fun, at all. 

The worst part though, is the amount of painfully obvious hackers in this game. VAC is the poorest ♥♥♥♥ing excuse for an anti-cheat system I've ever seen. One hacker will basically carry an entire team, and 9/10 times the enemy team won't have the integrity to kick the blatant hacker, because he'll carry them to the next rank. The most you can do is report them, but with how cheap this game is, it's no problem for people to make another account and rinse-repeat. 

Valve makes more than enough money on this game to justify having a better anti-cheat system. It is honestly one of the saddest examples of a company not giving a ♥♥♥♥ about their community that I can think of in the gaming industry. Say what you want about EA being a money hungry ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company that hates their fans, I guarantee you that you won't run into as many hackers on official Dice Battlefield servers than you will an official CSGO server. That's just sad. 

Again, I love this game. If you want to play casual or community or what have you, you'll probably have a great time learning the quirks of the game, learning the maps, and engaging with the goofy ♥♥♥ community I've come to love/hate. However, the competitive scene is pure cancer. I do hope that Valve reads these, even though I highly doubt it, because I truly want what's best for this game. 

Tks for reading.
-Sen"

												The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? ""Oh im just smurfing.."" You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being ""smurfing"" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY."

												I came to this game for my fetish of chickens.  When playing the  game,  I realised that not every map has chickens on it, so I slowly got angrier with the game... The lack of chickens boiled my blood. CSGO made me angry, Until, I found my dream love, Deathmatch. A Chicken on any map, right then.. I'd kick the bots, and chase  the chickens around for hours. Ah, It was so pleasurable, How I would do it for hours on end. The chickens are perfect.  I play this game for hours on end, and the chickens never disapointment me now,  Oh Chickens, how you are my one true love. I can't focus at school anymore..  I only think about chickens, on the way home from school there is a KFC, I walk past it every day, I think of chickens, One time, I literally stopped, and took a fap to one of the  chickens. Ah,  It was so good. 
Chickens
I love them

												Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues."

												Pros :
- Great teamplay if you have friends
- Updates to keep upgrading and improving the game
- Not being call of duty

Cons:
- Toxic community that makes CoD community feel like scholars ( occassionally )
- Hackers dnt get banned all the time even if its crystal clear
- Vague ranking system that seems not fair most of the time.
- I was legendary eagle and fell from grace due to ranking system update, its like getting a good grade after studying so hard, only for the teacher to decide to curve down all the grades becoz all the class passed.. its not fair, make ranking up harder but dnt screw the players
- Revolver.. really ? .. seriously.. why ?
- Overwatch not tempting
- Playing solo sucks
- The Idea of the campaign sucked big ♥♥♥
- Almost 2k hours and I dnt feel the game is rewarding me for my dedicated service.. give me a medal or smthng people :P
- I can't eat while playing.. big problem


As of April 7-2016 I retired from this game, its addictive like drugs.. left me frustrated alot, too many griefers and an increase in the number of hackers.. the type of hackers that smokes mid on d2 and takes out 5 guys with an awp inside the smoke.. that type of hackers.. Im focusing on finishing many games i left unplayed becoz i simply hunger for great stories"

												The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? ""Oh im just smurfing.."" You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being ""smurfing"" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY."

												Last Update
Goodbye, CS:GO. You really helped me a lot on English : ) and buried me with ""Silver II, the Nu:B"" on my tombstone.

--------------------------------------------
Update 17/02/2015
Hey my foreign friends. Have fun in the Chinese Lunar new year! May the goat or sheep bless you and have a safe and sound 2015.

Update 1/31/2015
400 hours and I'm still Silver 2.
-------------------------------------------
Last Update before Christmas:
Kids are lovely. ""Carry us harder,"" he screamed.

However,

I'm just a lucky silver 2 with swag-7 and pro90.

I tried my best to give him the Christmas present, but I failed.

So sad.

------------------------------------------
Update something about racism.

Well....as an Asian, I encountered lots of racism assaults during the gameplay. 

I would just simply mute the racist and report him after the match, cuz I play this game for fun and practicing English, not arguing with other players...

Fortunately, most people are friendly and are willing to learn new things about Asia. Don't regard all the jokes as racism. I also made some friends online, people from East Europe, State people and Canadians.

Hope the world can develop in peace and go hell terrorism! Yes, that refers to you, ISIS. Go hell.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prefer it to Rising Storm, because it has a crosshair.

Prefer it to Tomb Raider, because I don't have to aim by holding R-mouse.

Prefer it to Call of Duty, because I would know how I died.

Playing CS:GO is a good way to practice English. 

Not suitable for foreign youngsters, because I learned lots of four letter word from this game."

												I can both say yes and no to recommend this game.

Counter-Strike, can be good with friends but if you try to play a lot of random games to climb the ranks you will encounter the second most toxic gaming community ever. You get every kind of stereotype on here from the kid who slept with your mother to some guy calling everyone a b*tch N*gga. 

With well over 2000 hours I can not recommend CS:GO in its current condition. Why is that?

-Servers. The servers are horrible. 64 tick is not enough to play on. You will often encounter bullets that do no damage yet there is blood on the walls behind them. Their performance is lack luster and lots of servers are doing a stutter/stop as of lately or the registration is just... Non-existant.

-Hackers. They are still running rampant in CSGO. ""Prime"" accounts are still subject to them. It seems as if VAC is not working at all. You will encounter a LOT of them from Silver to MGE. (There are smurfs but you can tell them apart from hackers very easily. I enjoy playing smurfs as I see it as a chance to see what I need to work on to get better.)

-Toxic community. This game relies on three very major things. 1. Aim 2. Communication 3. Listening. There are very seldom times that you will come across a team that is willing to Communicate and Listen. From my experience (MGE or lower for the majority) A lot of people do not communicate because they are talking too much and when you ask them to hush for the rest of the game and to type, they throw hissy fits as if their mother just denied them a cookie. If you try to communicate with people and call stuff, and they blame you for their death becuase you're trying to communicate where the enemies are. ""One B"" - Teammate dies - ""OMG WHY DID YOU SAY HE WAS BE WHEN CLEARLY THEY ARE A!""  Everyone ALWAYS tries to blame others instead of understanding that it was just good timing on their end. 

-Gambling addictions with opening cases. Opening cases can be fun at times. However, the absolutely horrible prices for keys makes it a very expensive risk if you get a simple item that is only worth $0.02 on the CM. A lot of people waste their money here. 


NOW FOR THE GOOD

-Meeting awesome new people. I have met quite a few people on here. Some of the best people I have ever had the chance to encounter. It was awesome! We still enjoy kicking back and having a few beers. 

-Gaming Tournaments. TONS of LAN parties play CSGO or CS1.6 and it's an absolute amazing time. Everyone gets super serious but also come out of it with smiles, win or lose. 

-Hand + Eye coordination improvement. My hand and eye coordination used to be utterly horrible. However, MAAAAAAAANY years ago, when I first got CS1.5 my hand and eye coordination improved drastically over the time. 


Would I recommend this game? Yes and no

Yes - Having fun with friends is great!
No - Everything stated that was bad. And it grows the more and more you play."

												Most cancerous and stressful game I've ever played

I have nothing against this game, I find it fun at times but I believe the title I choose above suits the game overall very well.

List of pro/con of this game:

Cons:
- There are a bunch of ragers in this game that rages whenever a round is lost, or you don't follow their command.
- There are a lot of salty and trash talkers in this game. Some teammates call you names from r*ta*d to f4g and whatever curse words you can think of.
- Sometimes teammates gang up to bully one teammate specifically because the teammate is ""ret4rd3d"" or ""bad"" player.


Pros:
- Fun if you're into competitive gaming. But be sure to be thick-skinned as I listed above, many ragers and salty people in this game.
- Skill-based game. Skins and levels do not give you advantages in this game.
- There is always something new to learn from new strategies to learning nade spots, gun spray control, etc. Even after hundreds or thousands of hours, there is always something new to learn."

												In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in. 

When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body. 

The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money.

Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend.

In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a ""Hostage Rescue Kit"", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders. 

Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up."

												How Comp. in CS:GO works
> You're so happy, your entire team is made up of Russians, you know since they are Russian they must be good
> You're winning 13:0, so excited, going to get a 16:0
> Enemy team wins one round. Calm down, you'll get them next time!
> Enemy team wins
> Exit CS:GO
> Uninstall CS:GO

How Casual in CS:GO works
> Everyone on team dies from the ""hacker"" AWP that keeps killing you
> Last guy with 0 kills and 6 deaths is alive
> Know you're gonna lose this
> Last guy kills everyone on other team


How unboxing works
> Buy a few keys, open something decent
> Get cocky, unboxed 1 decent thing, you must be lucky!
> Unbox a worthless skin
> Take deep breaths, try again
> Get the exact same skin as before
> Cry as you steal your mothers credit card and spend $500 dollars on keys and crates
> Unbox nothing good
> Uninstall CS:GO and swear to never play it again, saying ""Idi Nahui"" from all the Russians to your screen

> Install a week later

CS:GO is the best game ever."

												Once upon a time on de_inferno there existed a single chicken on A site.  ""I must get to my family!"" said the father chicken.  Navagating through all the stained karambits and battle-scarred asiimovs will prove quite the challenge.  As the chicken creeps up the stairs into apartments he sees the glass shatter in the first room to his right.  He scatters down the hallway anxious of what will happen next.  There are 3 mysterious people wearing potato sacks on their head and must have applied way too much eye shadow.  He sneaks past them and makes it into the crawlspace.  ""I can't believe it! I may actually live to see my family on B site fishing in the koi pond.""  AWP shots are being exchanged down the middle of the battlefield and the chicken hears flowerpots shattering here and there.  As he gets to the exit of crawlspace he sees another potatosack creature hiding behinds a haystack and scuttles down into banana.  ""Who the hell drove a taxi down here?"" says the chicken.  He makes it down the dark ally and glances over to see the remains of his family.  They are but feathers floating in the burnt sushi in the pond after a thrown molotov.  ""I.. I.... I can't belive thi-BOOM-.""  A cheeky CT sits in his spawn with an AWP as he giggles in his chair after murdering the poor creature in cold blood.  Please, I beg of you, these chickens are endangered creatures and risk thier lives to venture through the city just to meet thier family again.."

												Hello and welcome, new player. 
Allow me to reveal some of the likely outcomes of you purchasing this game:

The 'Cannon Fodder' (40% of all players) - Never really good enough to make it past Nova 3, constantly flaming, talking sh it, changing their names and pictures to things increasingly racist, blaming hackers, smurfs, lag and weapon choice of oponents for just what is a mixture of adderall exhausted reflexes and having a shi tty gaming rig from 2002, frame dropping on source games. 
Can be easily identified by it's trademark defence mechanism, when being called out for being bad the Cannon Fodder will attempt to convince it's team it has been 'Trolling' all along.

Habitat: Dust2

The 'Enthusiasts' (30% of all players) - A wide range of Skillsets from Nova Master to around Legendary Eagle, these players can perform consistantly and at least show a basic level of human decency,  most of them will give an unenthusastic hand job for $2.49USD because they feel they are 'due for a knife' or because 'my friend told me he had a feeling' Will one day be doing unspreakable things for a japenese businessman on a glass coffee table to pay off gambling debts that can be traced directly back to a greedy cu nt and his case racket.

Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache

The 'C unts' (15% of all players) - A curious breed, come in two distinct flavours 'Hacker' and i mean legit hacker, not hacker because he saw your shadow in bedroom on dust2 and prefired you, you fuc king mook, These are players who either used to or almost fit into the 'Enthusiast Category' and were turned into soulless, spineless dic kbags who cannot win on skill or merit. The other flavour, less cancerous but just as annoying 'Smurfs' people who play at levels far beneath there skill to boost their friends, ruin other peoples day for the joy of being a cu nt or to boost their dwindling ego that is one Sylvia Plath poem away from a stomach full of painkillers in the bathtub.

Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache, Train, Overpass, Inferno, Cobblestone, Office, Assault, Any Operation Maps

The 'Pros' (15% of all players) - Professional Esports player OR someone who has played enough CS (usually in excess of 1500 hours - 9 weeks to us humans) to get to a level where they know every smoke, every flash, every angle, every strat on every map and to you i say kudos, kudos on mastering a video game to the point you know it as well as your mothers disappointed face when she looks at you knowing that while normal people are studying, working or contributing to society in someway, you were hunched over your keyboard for the 7th straight hour of the day, mouth breathing in pleasure as that voice says 'Counter Terrorists Win'

Habitat: Mothers basement

11/10 would play again."

												You can set the water on fire.
You can survive gunshots to the head.
You can tank a grenade from point-blank and still survive.
You can chase chickens.
Chickens can(t) chase you.
You can only kill a fish if you throw a nade in the water. Shooting them with guns of any caliber will not harm them at all (Why no fish scales-made armor?! )
You can fall from 20 meters and still run perfectly fine after that.
You can get shot in your arm and still be 100% accurate. 
You can lose all of your money(real money,for skins) and not get anything good.
Digital knives actually cost more than real knives.
You can lose your mind.
You can't swim.
Chickens.

												I used to recommend this game but I can't anymore. CS:GO is broken in a number of important ways right now: 

Pistols desperately need balance. 
Netcode and servers are horrible.
VAC essentially only catches the dumbest hackers. 
Overwatch more or less an admission that VAC doesn't work well but is also useless. 
Movement speed and run-and-gun gameplay style completely at odds with theme of tactical shooter. 
Tapping often offers little reward for risk in current spray meta (exception being AK at distance).
Jumping accuracy? ... Really? Why encourage jumping in a tactical shooter? SWEET REPLAYS!!!
R8 revolver... feels like an April fool's joke that never ended and now is just sort of a troll gun.
Non-Prime matchmaking a huge deterrent to new players - testing ground for hackers now. 
Prime matchmaking seems like an awkward fix to broken VAC and honestly still plenty of walls/etc.
Smokes still frequently glitch allowing players on one side to see through them.

I won't list toxic community as a negative of the game because there's nothing the developer can do about that. For all of you who want to cite Riot Games' efforts to improve player behaviour ask yourself this one question: have their efforts worked? No. League of Legends has the most toxic player environment I've experienced even compared to CS:GO or Dota2. Competitive games bring out the worst in a lot of people. That's a people problem not a developer problem. 

Anyway, in its current form I would not say that spending the considerable time to become skilled at this game is worth it as you will constantly be let down by wonky mechanics, bad servers, and the inescapable reality that there is a constant ebb and flow of hackers in competitive that make any sense of true competition feel absent. 

All in all, CSGO will have you asking yourself: am I having fun or is this actually adding negativity and stress to my life? The answer will vary from game to game but in the long run I think most people play this game out of habit rather than having a consistently positive experience."

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

												PLEASE NOTE THIS REVIEW IS TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY, NOT FULLY TOWARDS THE GAMEPLAY
REMEMBER THIS REVIEW IS A PART OF MY EXPERIENCE, SOME OF THE THINGS I SAY HERE ARE FACTS, AND SOME ARE MY OPINIONS
Who the fu** are you to judge CS:GO?
Mr_Oren, And from my 420+ (xd) hours in the game I think I can write a review and be an hero after this review.
I don't recommend this game not because of it's gameplay, rather, it's Community.
You see, the community is SO dumb.

Reasons for my statement:
1) Unjustified Kicks (resulting in ban)The last time I played the game (about a week ago) I got banned for a week for doing accidental freindly damage, it was anyways the last round of us losing (10:15) for us, and yet they (The players, not Steam) kicked me at the END OF THAT ROUND, which got me banned for a week (for getting kicked of too many games).
And YES I DO UNDERSTAND you don't get kicked by the algorithm (even though I did not) and get banned for 30 minutes, then 2 hours, etc
Stop stating that.


2) People leaving in middle of competitiveI cannot tell how many times happend to me that in a middle of a game, people just left our team! and left us to lose.
Now, I understand if people have to do things in real life, real life > CSGO after all, but at least make sure you have an hour or so before you start a game to make sure you won't ruin an experience for someone else.

2.5) ExampleHell, one game the thing happend to the enemy team, but rather than one guy, 3 people left from their team, I felt kinda sorry for them.

3) Use of specific weaponsThe community also seems to think that using ""p90"" or any of the SMGs is bad, or ""silver"", even though it's complete BS.

""Either you live enough to be called a hacker, or you die and be called a noob""

4) Game searchAnother issue I have with CS:GO is the fact that games are not checking for people from your country, how many times it happend to you to play a game with 4 people that are spanish? you're DEAD.
My point with this is that I think the game should determine what country you are from, and play with people from that country.

5) SmurfsAlso smurfs are a problem, a HUGE UNFAIR problem, and if you say ""It'll make you better to fight against a smurf!"".. I don't know what you smoked, but that's clearly BS.

6) GameplayThe gameplay itself IS fun, it's VERY fun to play, but just the Community's ruining the game for me.
Another issue (That is mine) is that I'm so addicted to this game.. I just can't leave it alone, I keep trying to stop playing and I come back, hopefully now I won't come back with my 420 hours in the game.

7) Unjustified kicks [p2]Another problem in the community is that people vote to kick others, just because they're ""noobs"", which is so BS.

Also Hitboxes are SH**, people with ping higher than 200 should not be even playing (or be moved to a different server)

8) ""You have sh** K/D ratio! you're not allowed to have an opinion!""Now for the thing I hate the MOST about the Community, is people using the K/D (Kill / Death) ratio to determine whether you can have a fu****** opinion or not!
As an example:
Me: Man not good idea to rush it
EnemyOnOtherTeam: 5/10 ez
Just STOP.

More Points* I will not download third party software to enjoy the game, I think it's stupid that I need to download third party software to actually enjoy the game and play with less toxic players.

* Some people say ""Oi mate, simply play with friends, will resolve your problem"", I disagree, since many things happend even with your enemy team like reason 8.
Besides that, what if I don't want to play with friends / I don't have Steam friends that own the game?

Honorable Mentions*All the people who downvoted this review just because they love the game and I dont.
*All the people who make ""reviews"" with a joke and get like 96% positive, or a moron that leaves the game idle with IdleMaster for 10K hours and then uses it is a joke.

*Steam:

You will experience it. I experienced it. All will experience it.
You will meet BOT Seth.
You will try to fight back. It won't matter.
BOT Seth will find you.
BOT Seth will see you through walls.
BOT Seth will shoot you through walls.
You cannot run.
You cannot hide.
You cannot win.
BOT Seth will kill you. And if you kill him, he will come back. 

Your only way to escape the curse is to leave and hope he is not in your next round. 
Because if he is,
you will be brutalized by his m4."

												Maybe the only FPS where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill. No bullsh*t perks or kill streaks, no auto-turrets, no air strikes. If you want to win in Counter-Strike, you have to learn the maps, play smart, and have fast reflexes. Since you work for each and every kill, it's much more satisfying than other current gen shooters."

												Main Review 
This review is carefully worded explanation on my 'departure' from CS:GO and why in its current state, I would not recommend the game. This is somewhat lengthy, so it is really down to you whether or not you actually decide to read it all. 

So, where do I begin? Well, after reaching the second highest matchmaking rank (Supreme Master First Class) in October 2015 and continuing to play CS:GO from there on throughout 2016, I can say I've had a lot of experience with the game. In that time, I've clocked 1.3k hours and have seen a lot of changes. It's funny really, when I consider the very beginning. For my very first MM rank, I successfully achieved Silver 1. That day I was so excited, only to find out it was the lowest rank there is. Yeah, that sort of sucked. That's not something that deterred me though, because back then, I found enjoyment out of the game and saw a lot of potential that made me want to fight to the top. 

So, what exactly happened which took that enjoyment away? During 2016, I continued to play competitive CS, that being through regular MM, Faceit or even some ESEA. The difference from 2015-2016, is that in 2016, I began to often take breaks. These 'breaks' often came as a result of several angry occasions where I was confronted by the issues surrounding CS. Those issues are mostly the obvious ones everyone knows about, such as the increasing amount of cheaters, lack of necessary updates, hit registration, community etc.

The issues are something I wish to look more deeply into. Alongside hit registration, there is the problem of accuracy as a whole. The fact that you can have an AWP positioned on a players head and somehow 'miss' the shot, yet a player can running headshot you with a pistol is just insane. Further speaking about cheaters, there is the fact nothing is done to truly stop them. The developers of the game are greedy and they know how cheaters can be of benefit to them. When the time comes for a cheater to finally get banned, they can just go pay to get the game once more on another account. Within an hour or so of being banned, they are straight back. That's not the only instance of them being greedy. Take the graffiti update as an example. Instead of focusing on the game breaking issues, they add paints. Now, this brought a lot a nostalgia. Of course though, the first paint you recieve is awful and you have to go purchase more in order to have something that looks good. The limited use feature that prevents you having a graffiti spray for more than 50 uses just further proves of how hungry they are for money. A last point I wish to mention, is that I cannot forget about the unbelievably toxic community. I do respect this one is difficult to control though. 

Even despite all these game problems, I always managed to return to CS:GO. The reasons for this, as follows, were boredom, the fact that I was not too bad of a player or after I watched a Pro/YouTuber perform really well. These factors gave me the naive idea that I could once again gain enjoyment out of the game. That idea was soon shattered every time, when I was reminded of the state of the game and how it hasn't improved on any of the given issues. Huge attention comes to the game through the eSports scene or the regular community, however nothing changes. 

In order to put an end to the cycle I got myself in of leaving and returning, I promised to quit CS:GO for good in order to enjoy other games and activities outside gaming. I certainly had a fun time in playing CS:GO, however the increasing issues, lack of attention towards issues and the fact the communities voice is not heard, has currently killed the game for me. Who knows where things will go in the future with this game? I hope things may look up. 

Side note - I find it very amusing that so many of the positive reviews are full of content that is negative about the game. 

TL;DR - Quit CS:GO because of cheaters, greedy developers, toxic community, accuracy issues, lack of motivation etc.

Small Update - 12/12/16 
In an attempt to avoid any comments calling me 'hypocritical', although I will still most likely receive them, I am adding this update. Just now, I have reinstalled CS, this now being a month down the line since having it uninstalled. Whilst I have got the game back again, this review is still relevant as my views about the game have not really changed. The simple reason for me getting this game once more, is the fact I have been requested by many to play. Through requests, I have made the choice to maybe play with some friends here and there if they need the extra player. Chances are my enjoyment on the game will still be low and I do not intend to play this game regularly."

												You can set the water on fire.
You can survive gunshots to the head.
You can tank a grenade from point-blank and still survive.
You can chase chickens.
Chickens can(t) chase you.
You can only kill a fish if you throw a nade in the water. Shooting them with guns of any caliber will not harm them at all (Why no fish scales-made armor?! )
You can fall from 20 meters and still run perfectly fine after that.
You can get shot in your arm and still be 100% accurate. 
You can lose all of your money(real money,for skins) and not get anything good.
Digital knives actually cost more than real knives.
You can lose your mind.
You can't swim.
Chickens.

												Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has 5 games inside of it.

 Deathmatch 
     If you are new you have to play this game. even people with 500+ hours might play this game. In deathmatch you are          able to learn how to use the weapons and how to improve your aim. That is why there is a possibility to turn of random weapons to you can choose only 1. PLEASE if you have 100- hours play deathmatch. (Dont use SCAR-20 to mutch.. people will hate you!)

 Demolition 
     In this game you have to kill people to get new weapons. Here you will learn how to plant a bomb. and how to use maps. you will learn you have to look back and look everywhere so you wont be killed. Also it is a good way to use multiple weapons. Not like deathmatch 1 weapon youre good with. 

 Arms Race 
     This game is hard. You need to kill as mutch people as you can. There are 16 levels. every level is a new weapon. kill 2 people to go level up. the first one who is at level 16 gets a knife. If he kills someone with the knife he wins. the maps are small and there are a lot of people. here you learn how to use every weapon (every weapon shoots different) (this will help you in Casual and more important  Competitive.)

 Casual 
     This looks like  Competitive. You have team mates and you have to win. sometimes its 5 vs 5 6 vs 6 8 vs 8 10 vs 10.  They maked Casual easier. Them damage is turned of. and you wont get a Cooldown. If you want to play this: in the beginning this will be hard. and you wont get mutch kills. if you play more it will get better. 
You choose 1 side and you will stay the whole game that side

  Competitive 
      This mode is for players with atleast 300+ hours ( I Thinks.. and a lot of players think that 2). Everybody plays this serious. Cause here you play for ranks. team damage is turned on. Its the same as casual. Kill enemy and plant the bomb. 15 round as Counter-Strike and 15 rounds As terrorist. the team who wins 16 rounds wins the game.

What I also like about this game is the face that everyday over 100000 people are playing. Every mode are people. you meet every day new people and sometimes new friends. 

every week you get 3 drops. ( most of the time 2 cases and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon worth 3 cents. sometimes a weapon with is worth more).  if you recieved the 3 drops you have to wait till monday then they will reset it. ( drops are random)
Also there are cases you can open. this is addicted like hell. In a case there are weapons skins. some are worth nothing others are worth 50+ euro.. if you are very lucky 100 euro/dollar or MORE! 

EVERY ONE WANTS A KNIFE skin.

weapon skins are useable in game. you can buy them are you can open cases. ( if you dont have mutch money buy the weapons.. not the cases ;) ).

last thing. Operations and championsships. 

ever couple months there will be an operation. that means. you have to pay 5 euro/dollar. and you get: 
5 New maps. Lots of Missions. New weapon skins. That is cool cause this will make sure the game will stay fun.

Also every couple months there are contest between the best players of csgo. you can watch them live! thats cool!

I give this game a 10 out of 10."

												At its core Global Offensive/Counter Strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken Microsoft mouses.

The emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around. It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty hasn't been able to reproduce. On the outside Counter Strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned FPS gamer.

The game is simply tactful; it’s brilliant when you’re alive and even when you’re dead the game is still fun to watch other players.

Global offensive is a competitive game and a casual one, although for casual gamers it's probably better to find community servers over Valve servers. There's a huge market place now for the items in CS:GO and not only that, there's third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these in-game items have created

You will also find on Twitch CS:GO is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions, if you need any convincing watch a stream, watch a competitive match and see for yourself.

This game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library. Overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself."

												You want buy this game ? 
I'm gonna show you somes tips for playing :
- Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test. 
- The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. 
- When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. 
- Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. 
- You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. 
- Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. 
- VAC is a good anti cheat. 
- Skins make you better at the game. 
- When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. 
- Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. 
- Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. 
- If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. 
- When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! 
- Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 
50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. 
- State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. 
- Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) 
- If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. 
- Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot.
- If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. 
- The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. 
- Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. 
- You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip! 
What the ♥♥♥♥ is strategy?"

												The game is a money pit filled with hackers. 
The rank system is a joke.
Overwatch is a joke.
VAC is a joke.
There is no anti-cheat system for this game.
It has a tired engine. (12+ yrs)
It's a game based off a skill game. Just when you master a skill or skills they just throw in another broke update
 and break more crap like changing the whole gun skill set (joke)

Adding the R8, A gun never in any Counter Strike, Is maybe all you need to know about the brain trust behind the game anymore. Best idea ever !  (Not)
I know lets add Flintlocks,Muzzleloaders,Catapult and Slingshots.

They will claim to fix things like broke spawns (Dust DM spawn) still broke !

DM (Deathmatch) has the Worst spawns of any game i have ever seen.
After one of the great updates you will have to play through weeks of people who have pings from another planet.
Random lag spikes or micro stutters, do to it's not optimized well.
Could it be a good game ? yes ! If they had someone who had a brain and played it and then fixed it and left it alone 
 other then adding the money making garbage (I know you only care if it's a cash cow).
Legit players suffer while hackers roam free. (I know you don't care cause you make more money) not banning people 
 hence people having so many accounts...

I have 1 account and proud of it.

I know people will hate on me and I don't care it's the truth.......

By the way i'd spend more money through Steam but after seeing what this game has turned out to be and the stupid taxes crap from selling the junk I get from game (not real money by the way, The real money has already been taxed) and the lack of caring about hackers.    "" I'll just save it"".

If your a legit player wanting to learn the game and enjoy the game you will be disappointed and penalized.
If you a hacker or a scammer you will love this game and be rewarded.....


If you look at most of the positive reviews they are from people who have close to no hours played.
If you look at the negative reviews they are from people who put a lot of time into the game.


(1/7/15 update)  They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...!


For all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours.
I've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players.
If it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do.
And yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore.......
As soon as my friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....!

""I never leave a friend or a man behind"" (In other words I don't bail on my friends)


After reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should.

If this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system ""Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money""  people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played !
This game would be great........
 There is a Mute/Block for thoses who don't want to know how many times your mom has had sex with a 12 yr old. 
But 90% of everyone you face has brand new account and has the reflexes of god and X-Ray vision of Superman. No one gets banned. Hackers will say ""I heard you"" or it's ""my smurf"". In any case if your Global and on another account and play as a global on a nova account then your a cheater and a scumbag.



The Facts and nothing but the facts........!


                                             Oh did i mention the game is a joke !"

												Ok, I think is time for me to write a honest review for this game

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the most broken and unfair games I've ever played...
but I still love it

Why? well let me tell ya

I've had some many feelings while playing this game that I've never had before like desperation with anger, rage,  happiness, sadness, adrenaline, etc.

This game became a part of my life, I've met most of my best friends in this game, one of the most important relationships I had was built in this game. I've met every kind of person, the one that rages every second, the leader bottom frag, the Canadian, the Mexican, the Australian, the adult with kids, the kid, the furry, very nice people, the most annoying people I've ever met in my whole life, the smurf, the carry, the bad team, the great team, the ''grill'' and the list goes on.

Valve makes changes without any previous advice to the players, and they make changes to the very keys of the game, like the rank system, a whole map, the gun recoil, the sounds of every gun, the whole sound system of the game, prices of some in-game items, and the community usually gets mad at it at first, but we get used to it anyways.

What do I mean with ''unfair'' and ''broken''?
Well, in matchmaking (prime or non-prime) you're gonna find a smurf, a hacker, a whole queue of griefers, derankers etc,
Valve tries to stop this, but I personally feel they're giving up which is really annoying.

Another example for broken will be the rank system, is so weird and unfair for some players, when you're Nova II sometimes the other team could be Nova master or Silver elite, or a weird mix of those ranks, it took me around 160Hrs to get out of Silver after the rank system update, even if I had good perfomance, no rank up for a loooong time

If you're thinking about buying this game, you should totally start with a friend, is more fun in general, but if you're a very first time player joining a competitive game, I can't promise that your team is gonna be the most patient in that game, usually some players demand people that already know all the tactics and recoils, without knowing that you gotta start somewhere, but if you find a group of people that is patient and most important of all if they help you to improve your game, you should stick with them and play together more often. But don't think you'll always play with them, trust what I'm telling you, most of these people meet others and move on, but if you have a long term friendship with someone like that, you're incredebly lucky. 

now Datsuke, all those things doesn't sound very appealing

Well, maybe in paper they don't, but after experiencing a good game, after experiencing clean headshots, long range noscopes, carrying a team, a grenade kill, seeing a hacker getting VAC banned mid-game, clutching the round, getting a kill through the smoke, being called a ''hacker'' for your skill, laughing with your teammates is the most satisfying things ever, winning a close competitive game knowing that you perfom well gives you a huge feeling of success making you play more and more. Besides, you meet very different people, you listen a new accent every day, you learn a new word or a internet term every day, you learn something new in general. Other thing I love about this game is that, learning, there's always something new to learn in every map, every gun, a new position, a new boost spot, a new flash, a new smoke, a new prefire spot. I have 1,400Hrs right now of play time, and I think I don't even know the half of the smokes in Mirage. 

So yea, this game is really good, most of the time, you're gonna see yourself ragging every now and then, but personally I think is worth it

												When I was young, tragedy struck my neighborhood when a bomb went off in a local park. I lost my dear uncle in that accident. Along with my pet cat, two hamsters, one very courageous gold fish, my tickle-me elmo doll, and all of my foil Yu-Gi-Oh cards. It was the first time I experienced tragedy and despair, feelings that cut so deep I vowed to exact revenge upon whoever did this.
I trained every day, running 25 miles a week, lifting weights in 15 pound increments, taking protein supplements as well as spending the majority of my weekends at the firing range. I enlisted in the military, only to be turned down because I was ""only a kid.""
Then, I discovered Counter-Strike;Global Offensive. A perfect simulation of the events I wanted to prevent and take action upon, I was hooked immediately. I threw away my running sneakers for wool socks and sweatpants, as well as a swiveling chair. I put down my weights and protein supplements for Taco Bell and Instant Noodles. I stopped visiting the fire range and instead purchased a Razer gaming mouse.

Worth.
My uncle's still dead though."

Há quase 12 anos um mod de Half-Life surgia na rede desencadeando uma nova mania. Lan houses ficavam entupidas de jogadores que passavam horas jogando Counter-Strike. Quem nunca aqui virou a noite nos chamados corujões? Mais de uma década depois, CS está de volta na versão Global Offensive. E o game, por mais que seja uma cara nova pra um velho conhecido, já me deixou com vontade de chamar os amigos pra virar a noite jogando mais uma vez.

CS: Global Offensive não muda muita coisa em relação ao CS: Source ou o Counter-Strike 1.6 que todos devem conhecer. Ainda usando a Source Engine, mas dessa vez com os gráficos atualizados. Mais bonito e com uma interface atualizada, o game não tem nenhuma novidade. As armas são quase todas as mesmas e os modos de jogo se resumem aos mapas DE, de Defuse, aonde os terroristas devem plantar uma bomba, e CS, de resgatar os reféns.
Logo de cara ao jogar, me deparo com velhos conhecidos. Mapas clássicos como DE_Dust, DE_Aztec, CS_Italy e DE_Inferno ganharam uma cara nova. Todos mais realistas, mas sem perder os layouts e as formas de jogar conhecidas. A portinha na Aztec por exemplo continua sendo um lugar muito perigoso.

Fora os modos clássicos, uma arma nova chamou atenção. Chamada de Zeus, é um taser de um único tiro. Pra que matar na faca se você pode descarregar alguns milhares de volts no CT mais próximo? Outras duas novidades foram as granadas. A granada decoy é a mais barata da lista e não faz nada, senão enganar o inimigo de que alguma coisa pode explodir bem próximo. Já o Molotov é uma bomba que ao explodir deixa uma área do chão em chamas, causando dano a todos os jogadores que pisarem por ali. Bem útil para corredores pequenos e portas.

Também foram adicionados dois modos de jogo bem parecidos. O Arms Race é uma corrida em que ganha o primeiro jogador a matar um adversário com cada arma do jogo. Sem times, é um estilo de jogo nos moldes de um Deathmatch. Já Demolition é outro modo parecido em que os jogadores começam com as melhores armas do jogo e a cada sucesso ao matar um adversário, ele vai recebendo armas progressivamente mais fracas até o desafio final com a faquinha.

Outra novidade é com relação aos bots. Além de mais inteligentes agora enquanto você espera o fim de uma partida, você pode assumir o controle de um dos bots. Bom pra quem quer entrar na ação rapidamente e não quer ficar esperando o jogo acabar. Muito útil naquelas partidas online em que o time adversário inteiro resolve campear. Os menus também foram simplificados pra compra de armas. Agora ao invés de 8 categorias diminuíram para 6: pistolas, SMGs (submetralhadoras), rifles, heavy (armas pesadas como shotguns e metralhadoras), gear (equipamento) e granadas.

O sistema de matchmaking facilita bastante a procura de servidores. Em nenhum momento tive que esperar mais do que alguns segundos para encontrar um servidor de baixa latência dentro do modo de jogo que procurava.

Pra quem procura um jogo novo, CS Global Offensive pode decepcionar um pouco, mas, pra quem está buscando algo familiar e passar boas horas jogando um upgrade do velho conhecido, CS:GO pode ser uma bela escolha. O game está disponível por US$ 14,99 (aprox. R$ 31) na Steam para PC e Mac, como também para Xbox 360 e PS3 na Live e PSN respectivamente.

Almost 12 years ago a Half-Life mod appeared in the net triggering a new mania. Lan houses were clogged with players who spent hours playing Counter-Strike. Who never here turned the night in the so-called owls? More than a decade later, CS is back in the Global Offensive version. And the game, no matter how new it is to an old acquaintance, has already made me want to call friends to spend the night playing one more time.

CS: Global Offensive does not change much about CS: Source or Counter-Strike 1.6 that everyone should know about. Still using the Source Engine, but this time with the updated graphics. More beautiful and with an updated interface, the game has nothing new. The weapons are almost all the same and the modes of play boil down to Defuse's DE maps, where terrorists must plant a bomb, and CS, to rescue the hostages.
As soon as I play, I come across old acquaintances. Classic maps like DE_Dust, DE_Aztec, CS_Italy and DE_Inferno have gained a new face. All more realistic, but without losing the layouts and known ways of playing. The door in the Aztec for example remains a very dangerous place.

Apart from the classic modes, a new weapon caught attention. Called of Zeus, it is a taser of a single shot. Why kill on the knife if you can unload a few thousand volts at the nearest CT? Two other novelties were the grenades. The decoy grenade is the cheapest on the list and does nothing but fool the enemy that something can explode very close. Molotov is a bomb that explodes leaving an area of ​​the ground burning, causing damage to all players who step there. Very useful for small hallways and doors.

Two very good game modes have also been added. The Arms Race is a race in which the first player wins to kill an opponent with each weapon of the game. Without teams, it's a style of play in the shape of a Deathmatch. Demolition is another similar way in which players start with the best guns in the game and with each success by killing an opponent, it gets progressively weaker weapons until the final challenge with the knife.

Another novelty is with regard to bots. In addition to being smarter now as you wait for the end of a match, you can take control of one of the bots. Good for those who want to get into the action quickly and do not want to be waiting for the game to end. Very useful in those online matches in which the entire opposing team decides to win. The menus were also simplified to buy weapons. Now instead of 8 categories decreased to 6: pistols, SMGs (rifles), rifles, heavy (shotguns and machine guns), gear (equipment) and grenades.

The matchmaking system makes it much easier to find servers. At no point did I have to wait more than a few seconds to find a low-latency server within the game mode I was looking for.

For those looking for a new game, CS Global Offensive may disappoint a bit, but for those who are looking for something familiar and spending good hours playing an old-fashioned upgrade, CS: GO can be a beautiful choice. The game is available for $ 14.99 on Steam for PC and Mac, as well as for Xbox 360 and PS3 on Live and PSN respectively."

												Dear Counter-Strike Players,
After a long period playing this game (~1000h) I think I have the advantage to write a better review than my last!


First I want to say thank you Valve for making a nice game like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive!


BUT:
There are some things Valve has to change really fast!


1. Cheating:
There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it!

2. DDOS-ing:
I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure!

3. Smurfing:
Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this!

4. Patches:
Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem!

5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver):
Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***!

6. Community:
The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly.


Over all:
Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again! And I know that Valve can't fix the community, but I hope the community will get better!


PS: I'm from Germany, so there are maybe some spelling mistakes!"

												PLEASE NOTE THIS REVIEW IS TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY, NOT FULLY TOWARDS THE GAMEPLAY
REMEMBER THIS REVIEW IS A PART OF MY EXPERIENCE, SOME OF THE THINGS I SAY HERE ARE FACTS, AND SOME ARE MY OPINIONS
Who the fu** are you to judge CS:GO?
Mr_Oren, And from my 420+ (xd) hours in the game I think I can write a review and be an hero after this review.
I don't recommend this game not because of it's gameplay, rather, it's Community.
You see, the community is SO dumb.

Reasons for my statement:
1) Unjustified Kicks (resulting in ban)The last time I played the game (about a week ago) I got banned for a week for doing accidental freindly damage, it was anyways the last round of us losing (10:15) for us, and yet they (The players, not Steam) kicked me at the END OF THAT ROUND, which got me banned for a week (for getting kicked of too many games).
And YES I DO UNDERSTAND you don't get kicked by the algorithm (even though I did not) and get banned for 30 minutes, then 2 hours, etc
Stop stating that.


2) People leaving in middle of competitiveI cannot tell how many times happend to me that in a middle of a game, people just left our team! and left us to lose.
Now, I understand if people have to do things in real life, real life > CSGO after all, but at least make sure you have an hour or so before you start a game to make sure you won't ruin an experience for someone else.

2.5) ExampleHell, one game the thing happend to the enemy team, but rather than one guy, 3 people left from their team, I felt kinda sorry for them.

3) Use of specific weaponsThe community also seems to think that using ""p90"" or any of the SMGs is bad, or ""silver"", even though it's complete BS.

""Either you live enough to be called a hacker, or you die and be called a noob""

4) Game searchAnother issue I have with CS:GO is the fact that games are not checking for people from your country, how many times it happend to you to play a game with 4 people that are spanish? you're DEAD.
My point with this is that I think the game should determine what country you are from, and play with people from that country.

5) SmurfsAlso smurfs are a problem, a HUGE UNFAIR problem, and if you say ""It'll make you better to fight against a smurf!"".. I don't know what you smoked, but that's clearly BS.

6) GameplayThe gameplay itself IS fun, it's VERY fun to play, but just the Community's ruining the game for me.
Another issue (That is mine) is that I'm so addicted to this game.. I just can't leave it alone, I keep trying to stop playing and I come back, hopefully now I won't come back with my 420 hours in the game.

7) Unjustified kicks [p2]Another problem in the community is that people vote to kick others, just because they're ""noobs"", which is so BS.

Also Hitboxes are SH**, people with ping higher than 200 should not be even playing (or be moved to a different server)

8) ""You have sh** K/D ratio! you're not allowed to have an opinion!""Now for the thing I hate the MOST about the Community, is people using the K/D (Kill / Death) ratio to determine whether you can have a fu****** opinion or not!
As an example:
Me: Man not good idea to rush it
EnemyOnOtherTeam: 5/10 ez
Just STOP.

More Points* I will not download third party software to enjoy the game, I think it's stupid that I need to download third party software to actually enjoy the game and play with less toxic players.

* Some people say ""Oi mate, simply play with friends, will resolve your problem"", I disagree, since many things happend even with your enemy team like reason 8.

Honorable Mentions*All the people who downvoted this review just because they love the game and I dont.
*All the people who make ""reviews"" with a joke and get like 96% positive, or a moron that leaves the game idle with IdleMaster for 10K hours and then uses it is a joke.

												I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. 

The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. 
With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. 

I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell."

												Counter Strike: Global Offensive, the remake of the classic CS games and not to our surprise, the devs did a good job. One of the lovely things about it, that of had not been kept I seriously doubt the game would be as popular as it is currently, it keeps the mechanics from the classic CS and CS:S and adds a few of it's own, that the original CS and CS:S games could have done with. CS’s weak point was always the graphics, the original games were based of the HL1 engine, which I am sure all you are aware is reasonably old, although it’s added a new range of updated maps, including two operations. The most recent being Operation Bravo in which a number of maps were added to the game as DLC. And once again, Valve have decided to take the generous approach to this, an example is that if the lobby leader has the Operation Bravo pass, and no one else does, everyone can play Op. Bravo, good job Valve, you did it again. What was missing/wrong with this game has been fixed by Valve, which is fantastic. Items have been added, you can have gun camos which is an nifty feature, although many think it's turning into TF2, which is a valid point, but Valve need there money, if you take a look at the price of the game, it’s not exactly the same as COD (ew) which has a hefty price tag of £40 ($60 I think) and CSGO managed to do fine at £12, which I think is $15 in the US.


Sadly I did not play the original CS, I have however obviously seen gameplay, and watched friends play it. I have played a small amount of CS:S and compared it to CSGO, which was considerably easy, some of the main differences are simply that the problems that those games have/had have been completely eradicated from CSGO which is brilliant. Such as small things that could be exploited in competitive games, such as the saving mechanic. In CS if you die, you lose all your weapons, they will be dumped on the ground for another enemy to come along and pickup, players if they knew they were going to use they would hide away from the enemies, so they would be able to keep there gun for the next around, the problem with this is that they would still get money from doing this, and therefore be exploiting the system in some peoples opinion, it was recently fixed that instead of getting money if you lose and you’re still alive you simply gain $0.

The CSGO match making system is an exceptional feature, the ability to play against players that are at the same skill level is much better than being forced to browse through thousands of servers in attempt to find one that suits you with a enemy team you can play against, and it is a fun game for both teams instead of one team getting obliterated by the other. Matchmaking works by waiting till you have 10 wins or 9 wins and a draw on your account before being rewarded with a competitive rank. Here are all the current ranks available in game.

Many people seem to think that this is like COD, you simply rank up from playing the game, no this is not true. You rank up as your skill improved, if you play well for a few weeks, and you finally get the Gold Nova you’ve been wanting for ages, and then you proceed to play awfully for a long time there is a very likely chance you will be deranked sadly, it’s for the best, you will be matched against players who are around the same skill level.

Recently a feature that allowed you to watch your recent games has been implemented into the game, this is in now way “ground breaking” it’s been done by other games before, but they have there issues, although I have not got round to actually trying out this feature I have been told that it appears to be working considerably well. The watch feature is great for those who enjoy re watching those moments of which they pulled of that beautiful AWP shot, or got that 5-kill ace.

I would like to say in this final paragraph, of the 250 hours+ I have played of this game I have seriously enjoyed (almost) every moment of it, sure there are some hackers, but you have to make sure to report them and they will be dealt with. All the factors about this game are good, but as all games go by, they have there problems, sure if CSGO has improved graphics that would be nice, and if *breathes in heavily* VALVE WOULD ADD 128 TICK MATCH MAKING SERVERS… this has caused some annoyance for me in match making, if you don’t understand what’s so bad about 64 tick, I suggest you watch this video:

Anyway, I highly suggest you buy this game, apart from my small rant at the end, and game is fine, good game mechanics, graphics are sort of good, I supposed most of the maps are well balanced, there are a few that I suggest you shouldn’t play though. The game has a small price tag, which I am sure will attract you to it even more, especially when it’s on sale at 75% of!

Hope you enjoyed reading my game review of Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and that this assisted you in making the decision of whether to buy the game or not.

I would appreciate it if you left a comment about what you thought about this, was is a bad review? Why was that, whats wrong with it?"

The community of this game is rude, cruel, and out to ruin your day. They will ridicule you for your every mistake, loose your games intentionally, and try to break you down. The problem with the community is not everyone, but is a large enough population to effect you."

												Community is ruining this game. I live in Russia and happen to play on russian servers. This is incredibly awful experience i must say. Russians are the cancer of this game. They are everywhere and ruin the community and the game for others. I wish CSGO would cost like 30-50$ on Steam and that would definitely help to cut the amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in it. I wish there was an option to choose who to play with but again that wouldn't help because russians are everywhere. It saddnes me because i fed up with screaming kids and chavos and im quitting CSGO because of it. I can't enjoy the game while i have to listen to angry rednecks on the mic or screaming kids for 40-60 minutes. Despite the outcome of the match i still feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they trashtalk 24\7 and rarely able to play. ♥♥♥♥ this game.

PS. I must notice that there is like 5% of cool russians that know how to play and are actually nice but alot(not all ) of them are just ashamed to be russian so the hide their identity from others. These guys are a huge minority and this is truly sad."
