								The game is full with bugs and glitches, but it worth its price. The game so much amazing. I played it from the start of season 1 up to season 3. In every update, the game is getting better and better. I recommend this game for all the gamerz the i know. You will never be disappointed from this game. The game is awesome. All you need to do is to learn how to play the game and understand it. It has special and diffifcult aiming which isn't like any game. Aiming is hard for everyone and this is why it it amazing for me. You will look to improve your self everyday and you will see that you are aiming better from time to time. You have many options to do in the game. I give 9/10 vote for the game. I really like it.

Training mode up to now is very bad. You need to read and watch twitch, youtube ,etc... to know how to aim with each weapon in the game, because all the weapons are different in aiming. There is no training mode that you can train your self with guns aiming to bots or any objects with different difficulites. Also, There is no instruction for the beginners about what they should do in game and how they craft everything.

Wishing that daybreak give more care about the game glitches and bugs to fix them.

Regards,
Hyp"

								Had over 200 hours in BR before the split. Afterwards the game still has plenty of bugs, bad third person shooting (which they recently made worse), and no new content. All they seem to release is new crates that cost more money."

								This game is a disgrace to the PC community. We are now paying double for a PRE-ALPHA version of a game mode that was already included in the main game: H1Z1. This is very clearly a cash grab. When you start developing a game, you don't decide to split it up and double up costs due to your company's own lack and misuse of budget. You are punishing the players and the community for a mistake in your own development. When you create a game and promise to keep it fresh and updated at least until release you keep the game running and keep the features coming. Both of which are not happening in this case due to a shady / money hungry development team. If you promise F2P in the future for your buggy PRE-ALPHA game and decide to go back on that promise PLUS go one further and make your incoming player base pay double for the same game we had prior to this split, you don't deserve the playerbase. For all players, new and old, we now have to buy skins for both ""games"" which are basically the same game and inventory format. Comparing this to CSGO, it is like having to buy skins for each game mode they offer, Casual/Deathmatch/Competitive etc. It is honestly ridiculous. Daybreak and everyone involved with developing / publishing this game, Get your heads out of your own asses."

								H1Z1 was meant ot be a single game where you could choose either pure pve or pve + pvp as most games, In the early access they stated that it will become free to play eventually, needless to say, they did not keep their word, not only they split the main game into two seperate modes (games), pve and pvp but also put the same hefty price tag for their ""new"" offspring. Greed got the upper hand it seems...  As if the skins weren`t enough already!"

								I think half of my playtime hours is the game not responding

UPDATE: Can't even play now since apparently my account doesn't exsist anymore, good job DayBreak

 Poorly managing their game  I can't believe I've wasted so many hours and so much time with this game and its company. ""Early Access"" has become just an excuse to poorly design their games and leave them to die while they work on their next one. It's disgusting how much money they make by making new games, then not managing them. You can't even make a base. And you know what? Once I open the game now, I get an error that states my account is no longer registered, yet when I try to create a new one the email address is already used. Even if I were to try to fix this, I don't feel like supporting DayBreak or their merchandise.

 Broken/Crashing Alright, even the biggest H1Z1 fanboys will admit, without a doubt, that this game is BROKEN. Let's face it. The biggest challenge to this game is getting it to work properly. ""But hey, it's just Early Access! So it's okay!"" Nah not really. Especially when this company is makin' the big bucks. Do you know how long this game has been out? How many players there are? If Daybreak cared, they would please their consumers, but no, they continue to gain profit off their terrible game design.

 To anyone who wants, or plans to buy this game, please don't."

								15 pounds / 20 dollers for a 'MODE' that all other games offer as a free mod or server so what's special about this i hear you  ask...

There must be guns and features that are not in any of the other modes yes?... nope.. Still 2 rifles and 4 pistols.

Must be really good servers and great performance yes?... Nope. Expect 5 minutes waiting times and 2 man BR's where you get into a game without your partner.

If you want to play a game that offers BR, KOTH, Survival/Dayz then buy Arma 3. One time purchase (except some extra DLC content in form of the upcoming Nexus DLC - Massive TANOI map) and allows mods that offer a much better experience than this. 

Daybreak idea --> Copy A3/Dayz but make it more runable (Good idea) --> Make it Free To Play (Another good Idea) --> Actually Lets not make it free to play (erm ok?) --> I see people like BR so lets make more money by splitting it into two games (No.)

Don't Buy this until its been released or fixed or things worthy of being added are added.

I'm not angry im dissapointed."

								Great game 10/10.... until you play for a while and realize there is no incentive to keep playing. If you play solo and go at it as a lone wolf you will have a fun time and can bet on your performance to get dope prizes. The issue is when you want to play with your friends and enjoy the teamwork aspect of the game there is no incentive for performance. So even if you spend 30+ minutes and end up winning the game you recieve nothing not a crate or anything. How do you expect someone to keep playing a game with nothing to show for it? It is a very upsetting flaw and disappoints many =("

								King of the Kill is like drugs, you're told that drugs are bad and you know they're bad but you do them anyway. H1Z1 is exactly that, a bad game that is so satisfying and fun at the same time it just keeps bringing you back in for more. If they stop making crates and focus on the games many bugs and glitches. This game has the potential to be one of the best PvP oriented ""Hunger Games"" style games out there. But with many companys money hungry for any profit they can get. Daybreak has not focused on improving the game but somehow making the game worse with each little patch. 

Overall Score: 7.5/10

Pros: Good Pvp, fun with friends, satisfying gameplay
 
Cons: Lots of bugs and glitches, terrible car mechanics, stupid chinese people, money hungry company, stupid skins and cases."

								As Much as I loved this game since Release I can't recommend this game because they've just dragged out everything for ingame skins/Cosmetics and small bug fixes that take them forever to patch they nerfed the AK-47 which is beyond useless now and It's just overall a Garbage game with a Garbage Community and you shouldn't feed more money to Daybreak.

I've played at least 100 Hours of BR to have a decent say in how improvement has come along overtime and they're just not doing anything to improve gameplay instead they're just going for easy money with Ingame Skins and Market Transactions. 

In my Opinion since the game split they've lost so much Multiplayer Traffic, I do hope they work hard so that maybe one day I can reinstall the game but for now The Culling is overal some fresher content to play so I do recommend that.

								I've Played enough for most... Wins All the time. But lets be honest. This game is absolute trash. Daybreak refuses to fix their issues... Like I dont know.. REGION BLOCK! I have Extremly Good internet. This game is so lop sided with people that have high ping dancing and glitching all over the map taking shots at you behind pillars, two tapping behind rocks, and of course the famous RUNNING THROUGH WALLS. This Game has gotten so much WORSE over the time that daybreak has gotten its grips on it. The only consitant thing about the H1Z1 KOTK servers are that they are inconsistant. Shots don't connect, they fly through peoples faces point blank even getting giant blood splatters and people still end up with 100 health easy pz. This game has so much potential.. Sometimes the game runs smooth and your shots connect. But thats like 1 out of 10 games played.

Word of advice... Don't buy this game. It will only ♥♥♥♥ you off with how terrible the Devs are at coding... RUN! RUN NOW"

								Lets see here, if you were to ask me if I think that you should buy this game I'd put it quite simply like this. If you are looking for an experience in which not what you see is what you get, then you need to look no further than this specimen we see here that acummulates all of the negative aspects a game should not hold over time based on the lack of leadership and moderation in itself, with these values it also embodies what we all hate, faggarinos, and that is quite literally the largest problem that is visible throughout the community itself, which correlates to the high level of dissatisfaction that everyone, including leprechauns, has to deal with on a mental and metaphysical level every single second this atrocious lump of mucus is alive.

								graphics 6/10
sounds 8/10
gameplay 7/10
     
(first of all, Im not a native speaker of english so there might be some grammar mistakes, hope u ignore them and understand me. :)

Im not gonna talk about the game much, this article is mostly about a spesific problem that I and many people  have. 

Its fun exept having a stupid spawn system, weird physics, many bugs which is pretty normal for such a new game in alpha so not really a big problem for now.

But there are many simple and small bugs that would be really easy to fix them for Developers - Creators of the game like the Steering wheels of vehicles not steering, door-jump bug, and many small things that i cant remember atm. 

A big part of this game is skins, almost everybody like them and have different nice skins, but we all  have to wear our skins every single time on waiting lobby before match, I think it would be really easy for Daybreak squad to make an option to Set skins as custom outfit on main menu or something like that so we wouldn't lose time on every begginning of a match. 

But the biggest reason of the game making me cancer is the developers of the game that they dont care about players, There are thousands of players who has the  ''Overlay not displaying with shift+TAB'' issue but %90 of them can't solve it properly and creators of game never publish an official solution or a patch to fix it. The thing that I cant understand its we all know such a greedy - stingy company is DayBreak, But many people can't buy keys-cases because of the shift+TAB problem, But they are insisting to not solve this damn issue and let people have fun. Its annoying A.F. When people text me from steam, I cant answer without pressing ALT+TAB, I cant buy keys-cases in no way, when my friends invite me to lobby i need to ALT+TAB again. 

I bought this game approximetly 1 year ago, trying to fix it since last summer, spent around 6-7 hours to fix and haven't done a progress at all.

								The game would be far better if the bugs that have existed for months were actually fixed. With every ""patch"" they release more problems seem to occur as a result. Bump into a rock at idle speed in a vehicle with full health and it blows up, get shot in the chest with armor that doesn't get damaged, ridiculous drop shotting that they will never fix, terrible desyncing issues, jumping through walls on office buildings, roof exploits, hits that don't register. But they add a new reticle which wasn't necessary, change the fire rate of the AK, and a few other things that really didn't matter, very disappointing. It has so much potential to be a great game but the development team seems to have no intention of fixing actual problems with the game."

								Im so diasapointed with Daybreak right now. 

They hype this uptade, lot of things gonna get fixed. what happends? its even more ♥♥♥♥ then before. im glad that i bought it in early Alpha so i dont have to pay 40€ for both games when i payed 20€ for both.

King of the kill (or whatever)... its even more laggy now than before. items doesnt even spawn some games, som games 50 people fall to their death because you chrashland. 

Daybreak, a tip for you. kick everyone that works with the game and hire new people, that actually now what they are doing. and stop being such a money sucker. 

Its been nearly a year! and you havent even fixed the ♥♥♥♥ing scoreboard yet. took you nearly one year to understand that both of the helmets sucked. that the AK was to op. that ATV was bugged and you died sometimes when you used it. 

do i recommend this game? sorry, but after this huge fail of an uptade. NO!!!"

								I idled for five minutes in the login in screen to tell you to not buy this game. 

I played H1Z1 prior to the split in games, and it wasn't worth the $20 then, and that's when it included survival and BR.  The game runs like garbage, and now the devs are going against their promise for the game to eventually free to play, and rather splitting their games in hopes of getting more money.

It's a disgusting business practice, and I urge you to not support it."

								Before telling you why the game is a no go, I have to say that I enjoy playing it with my friends its a lot a fun, we have a lot of PVP action and funny moments, but this game is glitchy as ♥♥♥♥. I will be naming the pros and cons just so you can make a decision for yourself.(*In my opinion* If you don't have any friends to play with don't buy it...)

PROS:

-The PVP is quite good and comparing to other BR games, its the best out there,
-If you have friends it can be an emerging experience and a lot of fun.
-The gun mechanics are somewhat cool.
-The variety of items in the game, even though there are barely some, have some use and you will most likely like them.
-Car mechanics are somewhat decent.
-A lot of places to loot.

CONS: (Im starting from the glitches that happen from the loading screen untill we are on the arena)
-When entering the game if you have a bad connection so many glitches will happen, like not having a parachute, landing under the map, landing and then 2 seconds into the game dying to the environment, etc...
-Sometimes while trying to enter a car you will receive a message saying ''Something is in the way'' and you won't be able to enter.
-Jumping from a 2 feet rock will make you lose HP.
-Some players either are hacking or have an amazing aim, you will see this since they hit you from over 100 meters, every single shot and this is annoying because if you stop to shoot at them you miss every shot when on the other hand they hit every single one.
-When you shoot at someone, and you are sure you tagged him, after he kills you, sometimes you will see his HP at 0 but he will still be running and jumping.
-Entered a jip, waited for my friend he entered aswell, turned on the engine pressed W to go foward and died to ''Disconnect''.
-The bombs dropped from the plane are bad since the day I bought this game which was over a year now, if they drop on top you you probably won't die unless you have like 10 HP.
-There is a rank system which im not even sure if you play against your own rank. (I was on the worst one Silver V and saw guys that would hit someone 100 meters away and 2 tap them).
-There is a level system which every 5 levels you get an unlocked case and you can open them to get some clothes, we should get cases every level because on the higher ones it becomes a grind to level up.
-When you finish in the top 10 you get nothing, you only win something if you bet on yourself free coins which after finishing in top 15 (I think) gets you skulls to unlock the limited clothes they have on the skull shop, and it only has like 10 cosmetics.

***SIDE NOTE***

The developers of this game are the worst, they only care about your money. After buying the game from SONY they decided to split the game (H1Z1: Just Survive and H1Z1: King of the Kill) this was the most stupid business stunt I have ever seen in my life (Since now Just Survive has pretty much no interest to them). They did this to have a team working on Just Survive and another team working on KOTK, LOL, since Just Survive is getting little to no updates I don't think they are putting much effort into it. KOTK is pretty much a carnival party at this point, all you see is players dressed up in a huge amount of colors that make them look like ♥♥♥♥ing clowns. The KOTK game became a pay-2-dress and everytime they update the game we only see cases, little tweaks to guns and no major/game breaking glitches getting fixed. You pay 20$ (or 10$ on sale) to play a game that its main focus is who looks the prettiest. Or pay 20$ (or 10$ on sale) for Just Survive to play a game that has basically no updates and the dev team doesn't really care about. In my opinion you shouldn't buy the game but after what you read you make your own decision."

								Let me tell you about this game.
This game gets huge amounts of hate for a lot of various reasons.

What people dont remember is that this is a game still in testing and isn't a full game.

The game definately has its issues and bugs which i know the devs are working on, but this game has huge potential.

If top streamers and players stopped playing it as a completed game and treated it as a game still in testing, it would get much less hate.

That being said i still talk smack about this game in anger too, but i also understand they will eventually fix the issues in the game, unlike in csgo's case were valve wont fix the game and ONLY care about money.

Yes this game has crates and stuff, but they are still releasing updates that fix bugs and stuff more often than games like Dayz.

I still recommend this game despite the issues everyone craps on DayBreak about.

								Lets start from the beginning.
Before the game split at Z1 it was amazing.The game felt amazing and i played it so much everyday.Nothing was more fun than this game.Fights were longer and better and in general the game was more fun.When the game split the game started getting some updates which i had nothing against until that day when they announced Z2.I tought it will be alright but then we got this.
We got a unoptimized map with tons of useless props n ♥♥♥♥.The combat became really poor.People who have way less skill are able to 2tap you because 2tapping is all about luck.People with computers that run this game on 300 fps have a bigger advantage and will ♥♥♥♥ on you 90% of the time.Hipfire is completely broken and so is the shotgun.Every fight people will go and hide behind rocks where you cant even see their bodys or heads and you will start getting shot from nowhere.People who are betting are sitting on the edge and people who look for kills wait for that 1 fight and then come behind you and ♥♥♥♥ you.The combat changed to much and the game is not what it used to be.The devs are working on skins and not on the game which is even more sad,every patch they ruin something and i have no idea how.I still play it and will play it but i really think a game with such potential shouldnt be falling like this and it makes me sad that after almost 800 hours of playing this game having amazing fights and wins the game keeps going downhill and not up.And this twitch ♥♥♥♥ is getting out of hand.FIX THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME AND STOP MAKING SKINS."

								The piece of crap devs that promised a free to play game(once finished), only pay early/beta access. Suddenly they've seen that Battle Royale mode or ""Hunger Games"" mode was very popular and decided to split the game in two, both with high price tag. Zombie survival and Battle Royale, now I would be 80% ok with this if this game was finished, well develop, well optimized, not broken piece of garbage, yes Battle Royale is fun, but it would be even better if it were not so broken and undeveloped. I hope devs go bankrupt because companies like this, money grabbing, garbage game making companies are cancer for gaming world. STEAM SHOULD BAN EARLY ACCESS GAMES OR HAVE PUNISHMENTS FOR COMPANIES/DEVS WHO ABANDON GAMES OR DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS!"

								This game is ""decent"" when it works, but the developers aka Daybreak are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and are inept at patching a game, it's pathetic. Shotgun damage seems more RNG than anything, but ""supposedly"" it works beatifully when connected by LAN.... yea great, let's all ♥♥♥♥ing have a LAN party like it's the year 2000. ""Spectate Mode"" was supposed to be release w/ Z2(new map and UI), but after multiple patches and supposed ""fixes"" it still doesn't work. Not to even mention the ♥♥♥♥ing car physics.

Let me recommend to you the new and already at the same level if not better in some ways Battle Royale game to play. It is PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, currently in Closed Beta testing and guess what.... THEY ALREADY HAVE A WORKING SPECTATE MODE. Oh and when you run people over... THEY ACTUALLY DIE!? I didn't know that was possible to do, I just thought that it was really hard to program in those kinds of physics... well apparently if you work at Daybreak.

So to reiterate, KotK is made by high-school graduates who are just chasing after money and invest more into advertising than into development, while PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds..... is in Closed Beta for <1 year and already at the same level as KotK. Oh right I should also mention that KotK is still in Pre-Relase/ Alpha for how many years???? 

If anyone from Daybreak reads this and has anything.... anything to dispute about this, go ahead and try. As you can see from my hours I have plenty of experience in KotK, was Royalty II top 200 players in Pre-season 1, and after that??? When I saw the direction this game was taking and how useless your patches were and how Daybreak was allocating their resources?? Yeah go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves, money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥s."

								My friend gifted me this game, they haven't added any guns to balance out the ak-47, which they nerfed into making it useless against shotguns and close quarters combat in general, instead of just adding smg's to the game to balance out the weapon. Long ago they announced that after beta the game will be free, and now they cut the game into 2 games in order to milk this planetside 2 engine, don't get your hopes up with this, the bullet detection and the non-existent anti-cheat makes this game unplayable if you don't have someone to play with, and this game gets boring really fast, wait in lobby, people saying china number 1, spawn with parachute, land, get killed by someone who already has everything they could ever need, repeat"

I didn't know that was possible to do, I just thought that it was really hard to program in those kinds of physics... well apparently if you work at Daybreak.

So to reiterate, KotK is made by high-school graduates who are just chasing after money and invest more into advertising than into development, while PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds..... is in Closed Beta for <1 year and already at the same level as KotK. Oh right I should also mention that KotK is still in Pre-Relase/ Alpha for how many years???? 

If anyone from Daybreak reads this and has anything.... anything to dispute about this, go ahead and try. As you can see from my hours I have plenty of experience in KotK, was Royalty II top 200 players in Pre-season 1, and after that??? When I saw the direction this game was taking and how useless your patches were and how Daybreak was allocating their resources?? Yeah go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves, money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥s."

								Game flickers like crazy in any settings above medium, in fact it is knwon that anything above medium is broken yet developpers let the settings high and ultra available to pretend it is there but in reality it just fools the user.
Edit: in fact manually setting LightingQuality to 0 and make UserOptions.ini read only is a manual fix.

You even have parachute control key mappings hardcoded in the game, you can change most of your key mappings but not for the parachute, the most important thing in the gameplay...

In game there is a lot of lag even on the server of your region, to pick up an item you have to repeat the operation like 3 times without even moving a bit in order for your command to get registered by the server. Just to pick up a gun on the ground it can take 5 seconds being a sitting duck.
Edit: and very-very often commands like the use of medkit are not taken into account which means death if you don't double check if the healing icon appear on the lower right of the screen.

I could also talk of the game physics that are so crap that they're hillarous.

Also the recoil of the guns is not like in any clever game, here recoil never resets so it means that you have to constantly reaim for all bullets fired and for people with a standard monitor it is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because of remanency.
Those crap dev could try to play Half-Life 1 which is 20 years old and done it correcly on release.

Edit : last game i got killed by an obvious cheater, so there is decomplexed cheating.

Finally this game is just promises that might never be delivered."

								It really is not worth the money at this point but is still a ton of fun. 

Its fun and addictive until you start questioning things, then it becomes monotonous, tedius and just plain rage inducing.
These 'things' include, but are not limited to, hackers, lack of content, bullets not registering, sniper shotguns and more hackers. Yeah this game really could do without the hackers! 

Either way it is good fun and I'm having a blast, just don't question things and you'll love it. (IMHO though, it probably isn't worth your money in this current state)."

								Literally the worst game devs of any video game ever. Instead of working on the game breaking bugs and glitches, all they care about is cash cow-ing their broken game with in-game apparel and streamer-focused events. I've had this game long before it split into two (which by the was was the ♥♥♥♥♥iest decision anyone could have ever made for any video game) and somehow the game has gotten worse since then."

								Look, honestly this game is fun, but man it's buggy as hell. The best part of this game is playing with friends and when you get into groups of 5, you'll often find that 1 of you crashes upon starting up. This game has been out for a long time and they still haven't fixed it. There are plenty of other bugs too. A lot of the time my game will even crash while starting up.

But the real reason I'm writing this review is because they saw that their game became successful and decided to split it into 2 games charging the original $20 for each game totalling $40 now. HELL NO! WTH! You can't just up the price of a game like that! It's been out for at least a year and now you are doubling the price. Are you serious?! This was supposed to be a F2P game upon release and usually the longer games are out the less they cost, but you are one of the few companies to go the other way. Way to trash your companies name for some extra dough, which probably isn't even going to be that much. And the worst part is, your game is still just about as glitchy as when you started."

								I'm writing this review because i was just in a game with a friend, everything froze for me for 8 seconds and when it worked again the car had exploded and killed us both. The game before that we had to start again, because he got kicked, the game before that we got oneshotted by obvious hackers, the game before that 15 people spawned near me and i had a reload bug.

I think you get what I mean, the concept is awesome and the late game is thrilling, but the developer decides to push 25 skin crates and twitch events instead of fixing the most broken game I've played for a long time.

In a good, skillbased multiplayer game, you control the outcome of a fight and you are to blame for your loss. In h1z1 it's not your fault 75% of times."

								Steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ made by the most incompetent developer team in the world. They legitimately can´t fix ANYTHING in this game without causing something else to break. You wait a month, two for the next patch just to find out that the majority of the issues aren´t addressed, some bugs are months and months and months old. Servers are some of the worst in the industry, de-sync is at least a full second in this game and after most of your deaths you'll be left with legit question marks above your head on how did you just die?!?! Skill gap in this game is very little because of how random it is and inconsistent. You can Two tap one guy and then a minute later witness majority of your bullets do nothing to the next guy and end up dead, get a frame skip where your game legit freezes for a split second or get crazy lag/de-sync where you peak back behind the corner but the guy still gets a shot or two or ♥♥♥♥ing two taps your ♥♥♥ even though you got behind cover. Hit registration is just awful and the guns in general are inconsistant, especially shot gun. Sometimes you one shot kill someone full health 10 feet away and the next time you stick your shotgun into the guys mouth, deepthroating him to no effect, not even a gag. Basically, you're rolling a dice in every gun fight. 

TL:DR. This game is garbage and i hope DayBreak sells it to some big time Publisher that will pass it to a competent dev team to piece it together. Then i hope that the whole staff of DayBreak studios buys themselves tickets to a cruise and hits an iceberg, causing the ship to sink."

								This game had something great going when it was owned by SOE.. Once daybreak took over, you saw the shift from a company trying to create a quality product with great graphics to a company that only cares about the money its getting out and literally cares nothing about the game itself... there is yet to be a single patch to this game that been game changing since daybreak took over...

Lets talk about the split.

With the split of the games, the reasoning behind it as Daybreak put, ""So we could have different teams working on the different games with different agendas....""
SO FAR EVERY UPDATE AND CRATE RELEASED HAS BEEN FOR BOTH GAMES, WITHOUT ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL FOR EACH GAME....

Dont waste money on this game,  I don't recomment it to anyone."

								Defeat your enemies with a variety of Weapons, such as lag spikes, glitchy car physics, Inaccurate reticles, amazingly innaccurate shotgun hit registration, frame drops while shooting and random ping interruptions locking your weapons..
It is in early access but a game can only be so faulty untill something has to give..

Untill i can i can play this game prpoerly without being disconnected or dying from a range of bullsh*t reasons. i wont be giving this game any more of my time. This game can stil have a good future, all the devs need to do is listen to dr.disrespect! (Slick Daddy Club ftw)
The concept of the game itself is so unique, and the reason so many people play this is becuase there arent many alternatives. Lets hope that the market can get crammed with these battle-royale style titles and then find out who is left at the top...
Thankfully PUBG will be able to become to top BR game. So im very excited for that.
Survivalists: Play DayZ or Arma 3: Edict for hardcore survival experiences.
Battle Royale Lovers: Player Unknown's Battlegrounds :D or Arma 3 Battle Royale.
I would write an extended review, but it really isnt worth my time at its current state.
If you dont think this game is worth a try, then Definetely dont get Just survive. its a watered down unsupported surivial version of this game. guess which one the devs are updating more..
Now if youll excuse me im going to wait for this game to be done. and grow a very long beard at the same time.

The game is in early Access so there is going to bugs and its not game breaking the bugs are maybe your car blows up for no reason or your shots don't register but that doesn't happen every game. And for people complaining about, get better at the game. I've won many games when my shots wern't registering and if I lost I play another one. The game is a super fun game. I REALLY RECCOMEND IT."

								 The honest and legit way on how to ALMOST win a game in H1Z1. (AFTER UPDATE)!	 
1. Begin by launching up the game. You will probably be forced to restart the launcher a couple of times, but it has always been like that so don't worry.

2. After 35 restarts, press the SOLO button and wait 25 minutes to get into your game. 

3. When finally inside the pre-game arena, make sure to scream as loud as you can and insult other players as much as possible. Perhaps let them know what size your weiner is?

4. You will then be entering the game. Unfortunately you will be stuck on the loading screen, so restart the game again. But once again, it's normal. Don't freak out.

5. When you finally get into the game after another hour of start up time, you will spawn without a parachute and fall to the ground. Happily you spawned next to a little camp and you found all the best loot. (No backpack, no helmet, T-shirts, golves and that ugly little pistol with the red ammo that no one uses.)

6. With your loot you will hide by the trees and act like you ARE the tree, until a little noob with an AR, 5 laminated armours and a sniper rifle, casually walk past you. 

7. 2-tap him with your pistol and spam C to T-bag him. 

8. With your new loot, kill 30 people and record it to later on let everybody on youtube know that your are better than StormenTV.

9. You are now starting to get sweaty and nervous because of the final 1v1 situation. Just as you are going to shoot your enemy with your sniper, you get a warning sign saying that your weapons will be locked due to bad internet connection. 

10. Freak out, run out to your router and make sure that it's running fine.

11. After finding out that nothing was wrong with your internet, run back to your computer and take a look at your screen.

12. ** 2nd Place. 30 kills. **

13. Get T-Bagged by the player who killed you while he brags about how good he is and how he had sexual intercourse with your granny last night.

14. It should now be midnight, go to sleep. Repeat next day.

								Since the split, the game 9/10 times crashes on startup for me. when start up works, i spend 10 minutes waiting for a game in a lobby. While wating the game either crashes or places me into a completely random game, disregarding the party i queued with in the lobby.The one time I made it all the way into a game with my friends, my framerate was severally more unstable then it was before the update splitting the game. The frames stuttered like my 1200$ pc was actually a 200$ laptop. This game is now broken and i will be opting out of the new updated version that brought two seperate games.

I LOVE survival games and everytime i play it has my heart racing. I am giving a legitament review and not complaining that they split 2 games.  The game all in all is great, The idea of it, the skill you need, and you dont need a friend to play it for it to be fun. I highly recommend if you love survival and if you are willing to look past it's problems because it's not the only game with problems."

								This game had something great going when it was owned by SOE.. Once daybreak took over, you saw the shift from a company trying to create a quality product with great graphics to a company that only cares about the money its getting out and literally cares nothing about the game itself... there is yet to be a single patch to this game that been game changing since daybreak took over...

Lets talk about the split.

With the split of the games, the reasoning behind it as Daybreak put, ""So we could have different teams working on the different games with different agendas....""
SO FAR EVERY UPDATE AND CRATE RELEASED HAS BEEN FOR BOTH GAMES, WITHOUT ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL FOR EACH GAME....

Dont waste money on this game,  I don't recomment it to anyone."

								In it's current state The game has several bugs and problems that were never fixed from it's Alpha/Beta phase. The game still feels Like it's in alpha. This is before considering the problem it had yesterday with server overload which should have been expected but wasnt. 

My problems so far:
Game randomly lags despite having a computer that can run it no problem
Random disconnections
Inconsistant frames 
Textures not loading
Not being able to leave game normally and having to force close.

there's probably more problems but I've just listed the ones on the top of my head.
I honestly feel like the game ran better before it became a ""full release"" or whatever you wanna call this.
I hope the devs fix their game. I'm kind of glad i didnt pay full price for this and got it back when H1Z1 was a single game with 2 modes"

Microtransactions and to take a $20 game and split it in to two $20 games.

 nice idea, bad developer. 
As I started playing this game, it was a combination of ""Just Survive"" and ""King of the Kill"". They have splitted it now, but I can´t see any changes. The atmosphere is just super awesome in this game. You get really nervous when you are plundering a gas station and someone parks his car outside the house and you here steps coming.
Coming to the bis Minus of this game:
The gameplay and controls of this game are horrible. The standards are ok so I gave it 5 / 10 but in combat you feel like you have never touched a keyboard and mouse, and the game is pretty new.

I really enjoy the Battle Royal - Mode, but when it comes to a fight, the game ruines his own potential"

								The piece of crap devs that promised a free to play game(once finished), only pay early/beta access. Suddenly they've seen that Battle Royale mode or ""Hunger Games"" mode was very popular and decided to split the game in two, both with high price tag. Zombie survival and Battle Royale, now I would be 80% ok with this if this game was finished, well develop, well optimized, not broken piece of garbage, yes Battle Royale is fun, but it would be even better if it were not so broken and undeveloped. I hope devs go bankrupt because companies like this, money grabbing, garbage game making companies are cancer for gaming world. STEAM SHOULD BAN EARLY ACCESS GAMES OR HAVE PUNISHMENTS FOR COMPANIES/DEVS WHO ABANDON GAMES OR DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS!"

								Alright, I've spent well over 300 hours in this game, but that doesn't make it a good game. In all honesty, it's garbage. Now what's really good about King of the Kill is concept. I love what they're trying to do, it's fun to parachute down, loot up on guns, and duel out to be the last man standing. Also a beautiful map. BUT, the bugs in this game are insane, there's just way too many bugs in this game. Daybreak doesn't do their job on fixing a game that has so much potential! You can run into a bathroom to grab a medkit, and somehow get stuck between the toilet and the shower and then you have to log out because you can't move. You can run your car over the tiniest bump and you're gonna flip and blow up. I watched Dr. Disrespect get rammed by a quad for about 30 ft. When he was driving a jeep, that just shouldn't happen. SHOTGUNS are broken. You're 10 ft. From your opponent, shoot him dead in the chest no body armor, and he doesn't die and you get dicked over and say ""REALLY DAYBREAK"". And the game is insanely graphically demanding. Better throw $500 into your Graphics card so you can get 60 fps, and since they made it so you can't remove shadows your fps just drops and it's so hard to play, and I have a beefy gpu. Oh god, and Chinese players. DAYBREAK! THEY'RE ALL THE WAY IN CHINA PLAYING ON NA SERVERS, THEY LAG ♥♥♥♥ AND MAKE IT DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO LAND A SHOT ON THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE RUBBER BANDING SO HARD, FIX THIS GAME PLEASE!"

								Since the split, the game 9/10 times crashes on startup for me. when start up works, i spend 10 minutes waiting for a game in a lobby. While wating the game either crashes or places me into a completely random game, disregarding the party i queued with in the lobby.The one time I made it all the way into a game with my friends, my framerate was severally more unstable then it was before the update splitting the game. The frames stuttered like my 1200$ pc was actually a 200$ laptop. This game is now broken and i will be opting out of the new updated version that brought two seperate games. I wish i could refund, as i did not buy H1Z1 Kotk or H1Z1 Just survive. I bought H1z1, a survival/battle royal game that was working its way to F2P and availability on Xbox, PS4, and PC.

								Let me tell you about this game.
This game gets huge amounts of hate for a lot of various reasons.

What people dont remember is that this is a game still in testing and isn't a full game.

The game definately has its issues and bugs which i know the devs are working on, but this game has huge potential.

If top streamers and players stopped playing it as a completed game and treated it as a game still in testing, it would get much less hate.

That being said i still talk smack about this game in anger too, but i also understand they will eventually fix the issues in the game, unlike in csgo's case were valve wont fix the game and ONLY care about money.

Yes this game has crates and stuff, but they are still releasing updates that fix bugs and stuff more often than games like Dayz.

I still recommend this game despite the issues everyone craps on DayBreak about.

Long ago they announced that after beta the game will be free, and now they cut the game into 2 games in order to milk this planetside 2 engine, don't get your hopes up with this, the bullet detection and the non-existent anti-cheat makes this game unplayable if you don't have someone to play with, and this game gets boring really fast, wait in lobby, people saying china number 1, spawn with parachute, land, get killed by someone who already has everything they could ever need, repeat"

								The updates and fixes come slowly and don't solve the main problems of the game. You can get glitched in doors and objects extremely easily still. Spawns are absolute garbage more than half the time. All the weaponry is centered in towns and is way too abundant. Queue times are garbage as well. For being out in 'alpha' for as long as it has, their first priority was micro transactions, not actually fixing the game itself."

								The BR part of this game was just fine before the split. havent played the survival part since launch but they have kind of messed up the BR part after the split, long que times and less wep spawns.
Not even gonna talk about the game being the same price even though its half the game.

								I had +220 hours on H1Z1 before it was split. 

I will tell you what: The concept of BR was good. It was quick, full of people, very competitive, always gave you that rush. It was good for alpha, but then you started to notice something. 
- The map sucks. Its like if you had spent 2 hours on far cry 2 editor. No details at all. Same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vegetation brush everywhere. 
- 3 main weapons: shotgun, ar15 and ak47. So poor.
- Queues to play. Such long queues. Was it that expensive to buy more servers? Oh wait...thats what the next point kicks right in.
- Developers only care about money. For real. Updates only had small fixes like ""ak now is a bit less powerful"" or ""car speed reduced"" and all the rest was about 100 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ skins for which you have to buy keys and crates. Its such a rip off. Its an alpha game, for ♥♥♥♥s sake, and they charge you like millions for skins. Winning battle royale only gives you horrible loot which is absolutely worthless, because, of course, they do not want you to get cool content by winning and proving yourself to be good, no, they want you to spend more moneyz in their alpha game which will never be completed except for the fantastic crate&key system. They even have their in-game money. Why? So they can control the price of keys. It would be fatal for them if people could sell keys or crates.
Its so disgusting to see that as soon as they get some fame, they instantly forget about the game and start looking for all kinds of ideas to rip you off. It bothered me so hard that my ingame name in DayZ SA is ""H1Z1Sucks"".
Seriously, only buy this game if all you care is about BUYING content that otherwise you would get for free. In addition (but last) their ♥♥♥♥in brilliant bussinessmen came up with the idea of splitting the game in two, so that instead of having one alpha game with two game modes, they had 2 broken alpha games for each 20€. And the worst is, they tried to make us believe it was because ""they wanted to focus more"". 

Oh, and as I write I remember another thing, the ""Green Battle royal"" or whatever it was called. They realised people only played for the BR mode, so they thought ""Hey, could we charge them for playing BR mode? Oh yea we can, but lets disguise it as a new mode with extra luxury weapon skins"". Then you win the br green and you check your AR15 skin and realise they only put 30 seconds in sprayin some green ♥♥♥♥♥♥ brush over the model. ♥♥♥♥in brilliant."

								pros:
fun game when it works like it should

cons:
micro-transactions in alpha
constant crashes & freezes
server lag
badly optimized

The last 3 I mentioned are things you would expect with a game that is in alpha, but given its extremely slow progress over the years, a release with a fully functional game feels very unlikely and therefore I'm going to assume it will always have these issues.

Do not buy unless you are fine with playing a game that will probably never be fixed."

								Let me tell you about this game.
This game gets huge amounts of hate for a lot of various reasons.

What people dont remember is that this is a game still in testing and isn't a full game.

The game definately has its issues and bugs which i know the devs are working on, but this game has huge potential.

If top streamers and players stopped playing it as a completed game and treated it as a game still in testing, it would get much less hate.

That being said i still talk smack about this game in anger too, but i also understand they will eventually fix the issues in the game, unlike in csgo's case were valve wont fix the game and ONLY care about money.

Yes this game has crates and stuff, but they are still releasing updates that fix bugs and stuff more often than games like Dayz.

I still recommend this game despite the issues everyone craps on DayBreak about.

								If this game played like the preview i would have payed $60, but this was always supposed to be a completely free game with optional cosmetic microtransactions. The only reason it is still preorder is because they promised free on release. This game could be so much better, like in the trailer, if you could charge a guy with an axe and have a chance against a gun. I think a machete or axe takes less than 20 hits to kill someone. That should be the risk and reward charging a gun. Right now its all open areas dominated by shotguns and rifles (too common). They should make areas as if they are making a map for any other pvp game, or at least take out the endless forests you spend forever running through only to get killed and respawn right back in the middle.

Right now the game looks like it could be great but these morons cant seem to stop focusing on making us buy skins. There seems to be no hope for this game at all."

								At the first time there were tickets that should give you an access to play Battle Royale, this obviously didn't make any money for developers, so they decided to split a 20€ Early Access game to two 20€ games (now you actually have to pay 40€ to get ""both"" of their games in Early Access. They promised that the game is going to be F2P at some point, but instead of that, they decided to make even bigger moneygrab. Once I thought that Early Access games are here because the devs want to get feedback from the community, to make a better game, to track bugs and so on. But that's obviously not true anymore. Early Access games are here to steal your money - at least Daybreak is.

If you want to play a real Battle Royale, go and grab Arma III, after all - Battle Royale was developed mainly for it, this game only stole it."

								Honestly I saw a lot of potential in this game but it quickly became apparent that it's just a money grab. Game mechanics have hardly changed since day one, items are being taken out of the game instead of being fixed because it's so buggy your pc would crash sometimes if you threw a molotov. I don't expect this game to survive long enough for it to even go into beta, since it has been alpha early access for more than a year now, and the only things that get added are items and cases so you'll spend more money outside of the €20 you spent on the original game.

It's actually very disappointing how bad the game is, because the idea is great and I still like to play it with friends, but the bugs, glitches and crashes really grinds my gears until the point where I don't want to play it anymore.

I'm really hoping this game will crash and burn soon, as it deserves."

								DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME!

The cash grabbers dared to split up a game into two. They charge you 20 bucks for this piece of work, average waiting time on servers to play on is 5+ minutes. 

The game has been out for over a year now. What have they produced? Less than even the DayZ SA devs in that same amount of time, which is rather sad considering they have to compensate for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ engine. A couple of pistols and a few rifles? 3 whole cars to choose from? Great. 

If you're asking yourself why I have this, I bought the game on release last year, thinking it might be worthwile. To be honest, there hasn't been a zombie survival game actually worth playing the last couple of years.

If you want to play BR, go play it on ArmA 3, where it's supposed to be played. Hell, even CS:GO's Hunger Games are more fun than this monstrosity.

Daybreak said they would improve gameplay experience. They promise but dont deliver. when they divided H1Z1 into 2 seperate game modes. They make you pay $20 each which makes no sense as in why they're so money hungry. They couldve simply kept it the way it is and improved on it. But instead they leave a under developed game and seperate it into 2 seperate games in order to Make it ""better"" for players. That was a poor decision daybreak. I would rather have the old H1Z1 that was already bad instead of having this 2 $20 games that shouldve only been $20 for both experiences of survival and battle royale. Dont buy this game unless it goes back to the wait it used to be.... the better version. Very disappointed. (And whats King of the Kill? rip of off the name king of the hill)"

								Ever since the game was seperated, my frame rate turned into garbage. Even if I try to fix it in game or useroptions, nothing seems to work. Also the game crashes way more. Also a lot more people like Bobby Shmurda are cheating.

Apparently God plays this game too. He took away my character's soul while running."

								So anyone in the dark, this used to be a game mode in H1Z1 and is now it's own stand alone game. The split was unnecessary and it reflects a poor quick cash grab on Daybreak's part. Even within their devblog updates, they fail to give any legitimate reason why they should sell 2 products for double the price and change nothing (aside from taking away Green Dawn). There are similar Battle Royale style games that are sold with plenty of other Survival games that are just as comparable, and don't encompass an entirety of a $20 purchase, but are instead an added feature or game mode, as this used to be. Get Rust or DayZ, which offer this and many other game modes, and what I would consider a more tight experience. As an alpha game, this is just dizzying and not worth the money, and it's not even a complete experience. Having already owned H1Z1, I still play it, and it's an enjoyable game, but it's not worth it, and a company that would try to pull something like this is not worth your cash. Sorry Daybreak; ya goofed!"

								The updates and fixes come slowly and don't solve the main problems of the game. You can get glitched in doors and objects extremely easily still. Spawns are absolute garbage more than half the time. All the weaponry is centered in towns and is way too abundant. Queue times are garbage as well. For being out in 'alpha' for as long as it has, their first priority was micro transactions, not actually fixing the game itself."

								H1Z1: King of the Kill is a rushed, poor excuse for a game. The core mechanics show some potential yet the game is riddled with bugs, glitches and just random acts of programming (E.G Death to Doors and Fences).

If the developers actually worked on the core gameplay, instead of pumping out useless cosmetic items, you would probably have a better game.

If your tossing up on buying this game, save your money, look elsewhere. This ♥♥♥♥ stain isnt worthy of my toilet."

								King of the Kill ist das verbugteste Spiel was ich jemals gezockt habe. Und die Entwickler machen immer so weiter. Neues Update raushauen was wirklich immer hunderte Bugs aufweist. Egal raus damit. Sollen die Spieler sich doch mit den Bugs rumärgern. Und das ist regelmäßig so, obwohl ein Test Server existiert, wo die ganzen Bugs nach dem Testen eigentlich ausgemerzt sein sollten.

Hauptsache ist, dass es bei jedem Update eine neue Kiste gibt, die man an die Spieler verscheuern kann. Darin befindet sich allerdings nicht etwas was wertvoll sein kann, wie bei CS:GO, sondern nur irgendein Plunder, den man nichtmal mehr im Steam-Market verkaufen kann.

Das Prinzip von KOTK ist klasse, wenn da nicht diese miserablen Entwickler von Daybreak wären. Ich warte ja noch auf ein konkurrenzfähiges Spiel. Bisher sind alle anderen Battle Royale Ableger allerdings total laggy (Arma3, Ark) oder es passt irgendwas anderes nicht (The Culling -> nur schlecht umgesetzter Nahkampf).

								Do Not Buy This Game! This gamemaker is 100% focused on money. After 35 tweets, 10 e-mails and several attempts trying to contact them otherwise, I still got no respond. Not even a read confirmation. I record all my gameplay and uploaded several video`s for daybreaker where it clearly shows a hacker. No response... Now my account has been stolen and they expect me to re-buy the game. Which costs 40$ for both games nowadays. 
The game is ruled by hackers and no fun at all if I look back at the time I spent on this game. I was always busy trying to capture hackers. 
Do Not Purchase This Game! It`s endless frustration because of hackers!"

								I probably have about 250+ hours in the original H1Z1. Mostly BR but some survival as well. This game is garbage. Hot steaming garbage. The bugs and blatant balancing issues that have been in this game since launch are still here and probably won't change. They cut the already ♥♥♥♥ content in half and have the balls to ask for more money for BOTH games. I've given it time and yet nothing changes. Hey, do you want to float in the air in the start of a BR for 45 seconds? Only to land to be gunned down by someone with loot already? Good! Now enjoy queueing again. Want to get shot through walls because the netcode is so ♥♥♥♥ that your movement means nothing? Want someone to drive at you in a vehicle going 90 mph only to jump out 5 feet from you and have their model lag behind so you can't remotely get a shot? Want to get gang ♥♥♥♥ed in solo BR? Want to spawn in random forests with one ♥♥♥♥ing building so you can spend 20 minutes walking to the safe zone, just to get slaughtered by someone who actually got loot? The list goes on. Don't worry though, those will never get fixed, but hey, at least they can add more crates!!!! These devs want money, nothing more, nothing less. Until they get their heads on straight, this game will always be a terribly optimized, buggy, unbalanced, turd."

Doing really well, get a jeep get fully geared up, I get up the mountain after outrunning another jeep trying to kill me.. Only to get shot through the wall by a hacker. Its been over a year longer than that and these guys still ahve not got their ♥♥♥♥ together. THE GAME IS FULL OF HACKERS! Why play a survival game thats full of hackers, their are many games out there that are successful at getting these people out so I know its not impossible.. But you guys are pathetic glad I never wasted a cent buying your stupid skins ethier. Go ahead get the top ten in a BR, how about even 2nd or 1st place... Guess what? You ge the same stupid ♥♥♥♥ing shirt over and over... This game is done, im gonna let it burn and im not supporting anything this company puts out anymore!

								This half ♥♥♥♥♥ game is yet another example of how greedy game devs release half a product and then split into 2 seperate products that are incomplete and buggy as ♥♥♥♥, then keep it in alpha stage so they have an excuse for it.
the idea of the game is good, but the game devs just want your money and dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about game quality

								Literally the worst game devs of any video game ever. Instead of working on the game breaking bugs and glitches, all they care about is cash cow-ing their broken game with in-game apparel and streamer-focused events. I've had this game long before it split into two (which by the was was the ♥♥♥♥♥iest decision anyone could have ever made for any video game) and somehow the game has gotten worse since then."

								 The honest and legit way on how to ALMOST win a game in H1Z1. (AFTER UPDATE)!	 
1. Begin by launching up the game. You will probably be forced to restart the launcher a couple of times, but it has always been like that so don't worry.

2. After 35 restarts, press the SOLO button and wait 25 minutes to get into your game. 

3. When finally inside the pre-game arena, make sure to scream as loud as you can and insult other players as much as possible. Perhaps let them know what size your weiner is?

4. You will then be entering the game. Unfortunately you will be stuck on the loading screen, so restart the game again. But once again, it's normal. Don't freak out.

5. When you finally get into the game after another hour of start up time, you will spawn without a parachute and fall to the ground. Happily you spawned next to a little camp and you found all the best loot. (No backpack, no helmet, T-shirts, golves and that ugly little pistol with the red ammo that no one uses.)

6. With your loot you will hide by the trees and act like you ARE the tree, until a little noob with an AR, 5 laminated armours and a sniper rifle, casually walk past you. 

7. 2-tap him with your pistol and spam C to T-bag him. 

8. With your new loot, kill 30 people and record it to later on let everybody on youtube know that your are better than StormenTV.

9. You are now starting to get sweaty and nervous because of the final 1v1 situation. Just as you are going to shoot your enemy with your sniper, you get a warning sign saying that your weapons will be locked due to bad internet connection. 

10. Freak out, run out to your router and make sure that it's running fine.

11. After finding out that nothing was wrong with your internet, run back to your computer and take a look at your screen.

12. ** 2nd Place. 30 kills. **

13. Get T-Bagged by the player who killed you while he brags about how good he is and how he had sexual intercourse with your granny last night.

14. It should now be midnight, go to sleep. Repeat next day.

								I idled for five minutes in the login in screen to tell you to not buy this game. 

I played H1Z1 prior to the split in games, and it wasn't worth the $20 then, and that's when it included survival and BR.  The game runs like garbage, and now the devs are going against their promise for the game to eventually free to play, and rather splitting their games in hopes of getting more money.

It's a disgusting business practice, and I urge you to not support it."

								Bought the game, downloaded it, tried to play it with 2 friends.
Launched the game, tried to make an account, saw I couldn't select any country other than the US. I thought ""Huh, that's strange. Oh well, we'll see what happens.""
Couldn't even create an account - ""We're sorry, but you are unable to sign up for a Daybreak Account at this time.""
Tried this for about 30 minutes then gave up, played Overwatch, had a good time with a game that actually lets you play it after you buy it.

EDIT: Apart from this whole thing at the start, it's an alright game once you get into it. Worth buying if you like games like this, just look it up on youtube."

								♥♥♥♥ing monkeys can make better game. They can not fix shotgun for 2 years, they can't fix mouse disappear when you shift+tab in loading screen, it's in game since the new IU and map came out, they cant fix desync problems also problem that lasts 2 years, they said they fixed car boost bug - not true, they said they fixed crouch spamming - not true as well, they can not fix infinite loading screens, they can not fix hitreg, they are probably using 16 tick servers, also there was a vote for option to turn off shadows when z2 came out, 90% of votes were for yes, still not in game and many, many more... They don't communicate with people that play the game, when there is a bug they are acting like they don't see it even tho many reddit posts are being created, they don't care about us or bugs, all they care about is new crates to make money. Also the Z2 is ♥♥♥♥ gay map and I don't like it."

								Just some handy advice for the company that's making this game ( don't make another game after this). You guys just got lucky with this. It ""HAD"" something.

Money whoring out all of your customers isn't the way to treat the ones that were intrested in your ♥♥♥♥ing game. Instead of making some ♥♥♥♥ing cases you guys should've made more weapons, more fun and more cars. Alpha = moneywhoring until no one cares anymore and drop the game...

G ♥♥♥♥ing G losers.

*New update came out called ""fagnition""
Another freaking reason to not buy this game, good idea for a gamemode yeah but ♥♥♥♥ over the shotguns and make them shoot across the map without an easy to control recoil... nice

You plebs can keep on recommending and I'll never care I'm just trying to warn the people reading this to NEVER buy anything from this company because it's terrible... They had a chance and they had to come out with 1 update of 1.1gb of pure horse ♥♥♥♥.

Like come on? Think about it, you're having a stroll, some weird ♥♥♥ shows up with a shotgun 50 metres away and he one taps you with a shotgun... Very nice...

I just have one question for you developpers out there, are you TESTING your updates?!"

								Thank you Daybreak for giving me another opportunity to give a bad review. 

Seriously though, from day 1 H1Z1 has hardly improved. There has been some 'stuff' added but they spend all their time on releasing [crates] skins for the kids. How about improving the combat mechanics and give us a game that is about PvZ and not PvK (players vs. kids). 

H1Z1: King of the Kill. The best copy/paste game of all time."

								This game has potential, it has had potential for the entire 18 months it has been in early access. It's a shame then that the absolute pirates at Daybreak Game Company cannot work through the issues this game has. Updates to the game mechanics and interface have been consistently laced with flaws and are mainly there to placate the player base and allow Daybreak to sell more crates and keys. You would think with over 1 million early access sales and their ever consistent crate updates that Daybreak might be able to employ some competent developers."

								The fact of the matter is this is a awesome concept and scratches the right itch I had as a competitive gamer, however, Day Break Games seem to value gimick releases over actually fixing the game they have. This game has been in Early Access for years now and it still plagued by Blocker level bugs that just never get fixed. 

Please, vote with your dollar by spend it elsewhere. As much as I would love to see this game succeed, I cannot recommend you purchase it at this time. I firmly believe the money will not go to support this title and just be wasted by the Studio Heads who on Glassdoor are portrated as unquailified and not concerned with making great games but making a dollar."

								So anyone in the dark, this used to be a game mode in H1Z1 and is now it's own stand alone game. The split was unnecessary and it reflects a poor quick cash grab on Daybreak's part. Even within their devblog updates, they fail to give any legitimate reason why they should sell 2 products for double the price and change nothing (aside from taking away Green Dawn). There are similar Battle Royale style games that are sold with plenty of other Survival games that are just as comparable, and don't encompass an entirety of a $20 purchase, but are instead an added feature or game mode, as this used to be. Get Rust or DayZ, which offer this and many other game modes, and what I would consider a more tight experience. As an alpha game, this is just dizzying and not worth the money, and it's not even a complete experience. Having already owned H1Z1, I still play it, and it's an enjoyable game, but it's not worth it, and a company that would try to pull something like this is not worth your cash. Sorry Daybreak; ya goofed!"

								Well,H1Z1 KOTK is a nice game.People might call the Devs Money Grabbers because they splitted H1Z1 into H1Z1 King of the Kill and H1Z1 Just Survive.Everyone whines about his 200+ Hours they spent in this Game before the split.You get both Games when u bought the Game before the split,pretty fair in my opinion.The Game itself is pretty nice optimised,sure there are still some bugs and other things that should be fixed,nothing big at all.The BR Mode didnt change at all,just a the new Air Drop System,Scrappy yard and the new Z2 Map.I liked the previous Z1 Map more but thats a matter of taste (or tactic :P).The only thing im missing are SMGs since we have 4 pistol calibers but the only thing Devs release are new crates with more skins.People also cry about Cheaters in this Game and Just Survive.Battleye is one of the worst Anti-Cheat Programs every made (besides Punkbuster) but for some reason its doing a pretty good job in H1Z1."

								This game is very fun when it's fun (20% of the time?)... However, the other 80% of the time, you'll want to rip your hair out, break your peripherals, and curse the developers. Vast majority of deaths are inexplicable -- for instance, you may shoot someone point blank with a shotgun only for that person to do the same to you and you are the only to die. When the death screen comes up, that person still has 70+ hp often regardless of whether or not they had armour. I could go on and on. Development is a disgrace. This game is a minimum of two years out from being a releasable game because the developers rarely update the game. When they do, they often improve one thing but degrade or break one or two other aspects. Is it worth 20 dollars? Yeah. Will you hate yourself for playing? Definitely. Note to new gamers: this game is not friendly to beginners. At all. Isn't even friendly to veterans like myself with 15+ wins."

								As someone who likes the game enough to say yeah it's a great game, the dev's really cucked themselves by splitting the game in two and not only making them both separate purchases but also making it so they are both £15 which is disgusting not going to lie.

Plus, look at all those negative reviews...All because you got greedy. To reinforce what I previously stated you literally cucked yourselves."

								Game has A LOT of problems. View distance on 3rd and 1st person is literaly broken. Bullet drop is incredibly miscoded/broken. There are servers in North America, but West only. There's a lot of lags and misconception.

Good game concept, but this game is still the story of Early Access game that will give them money in the end and you will never have a good service as much as the price you pay for it. 

My personnal opinion: Don't buy until full release. Do not encourage Early Access games such as this one."

								Lets see here, if you were to ask me if I think that you should buy this game I'd put it quite simply like this. If you are looking for an experience in which not what you see is what you get, then you need to look no further than this specimen we see here that acummulates all of the negative aspects a game should not hold over time based on the lack of leadership and moderation in itself, with these values it also embodies what we all hate, faggarinos, and that is quite literally the largest problem that is visible throughout the community itself, which correlates to the high level of dissatisfaction that everyone, including leprechauns, has to deal with on a mental and metaphysical level every single second this atrocious lump of mucus is alive.

								Having played a lot of Battle Royal in H1Z1 (before they split the game), I can say this game mode is pretty fun. But, it is just ONE game mode. So, ask yourself if it is worth buying a 20€ game for just ONE gamemode, a gamemode previously part of another game!?

-----

Daybreak claims that they will be adding more gamemodes, but that's yet to be seen. We don't know what gamemodes or how many will be added. Reading the early acces page they claim to add additional gamemodes and game rules. Judging the history of this game/development, I would not be supprised if they only add slight variations of the ONE gamemode Battle Royal.

Before the split, there already where 3 variants of this game mode, you had one without zombies, one with zombies and one with special rewards for winning! This last mode was behind a cash wall and you need to buy tickets for real hard cash to join this mode.

Technicly they could say they have 3 gamemodes. Then you have the same game with team of 2, or team of 5 players. So there you have it, 5 gamemodes! :P

We have to wait and see what the new gamemodes are, if any are added!

Ask yourself, knowing this, is ONE gamemode still worth 20€?

-----

Let's inform you some more, because this game has a rocky history with many claims that never became reality!

They ones claimed to NEVER add pay2win mechanics to this game, then airdrops where added to survival mode that gave you food, water, weapons and ammo! Airdrops are behind a paywall from real hard cash! Though they changed the way this works but still ...

They claimed this game would become free2play ones released. Guess what, it's 20€ with additional supply crates and cosmatic microtransactions! Even payed gamemodes like the Battle Royal variant (Green Dawn) and airdrops for ingame loot.

Again, ask yourself, is this game worth 20€, with possible new gamemodes behind cash wall, with micro transactions and many broken promises?

Then the worst part, the recent split of H1Z1 into two games. 

This game, King of the Kill, was part of the original H1Z1. You had survival servers and Battle Royal servers! Now you have the survival game, 20€ and the battle royal game for another 20€! And what would happen if say a new gamemode is added to King of the Kill, which becomes very popular, will they split agian? Who knows!?

This split would not be the worst of things, if they cut the price in half. Would be fair since they cut the game in half but nope, now you pay 2x20€ for something that ones was 1x20€, for something that ones was promised to be free2play!

Also, remember you now need to pay double for microtransactions. Getting a new piece of clothing from a microtransaction was universal availible for all servers and gamemodes. Now, if you want that same piece of clothing be prepared to buy the same item twice!!!

Knowing all of this, ask yourself is ONE gamemode worth 20€?

-----

With this out of the way you might want to know if this ONE gamemode is fun and yes, I said I have lots of fun with this gamemode. So let's get into that!

You spawn with around 150 other players on a large open map. Everyone drops down from the sky with a parasute. It's now time to land as fast as you can, so you can be the first to loot weapons, ammo, backpacks and more. So you can be the first to blast others in the face.

After a few minutes a savezone is drawn on your map, because toxic fog will be released and slowly drive you towards the savezone. This mechanic is fun and usefull to drive the remaining players towards the same spot.

Though there is only ONE map it's big enough to be fun for a long time. Mainly because a lot of things are random. Not the map itself but your spawn location is random, weapon spawns are random and the savezones are random. One match ends in an urban location and another on top of the mountains.

All seems good, but there is also a lot wrong with the game and it's mechanics!

Spawning for example! You don't spawn at the same time as your enemies. It depends on your loading time, internet connection and random bad luck (sometimes the game takes 2 or 3 times longer to load). This means people with faster hardware and internet connection land faster, getting guns fasters and thus have an increased change to win!

Next problem is that hitbox detection and netcode are so random. With a bit of bad luck you can shoot somebody in the head for multiple times without them dieing. While other times you one hit kill them.

Same with the shotgun, it's spread pattern is random. So you can almost get sniped from long distance with a shotgun while other times you can't hit/kill somebody at close range! And it's all luck, or badluck depending how it ends!

On top of that there aren't many weapons and in the end it comes down to AR15 for long range, shotgun for close range. Perhaps the AK47 (though it got nerved) or if you are lucky the hunting rifle (sniper that only drops from airdrops). All the other weapons are just useless compared to the above, so bows, crossbows and pistols are ignored! You only use them if they are the first weapon you can find early game.

-----

Eventhough this gamemode is a lot of fun, even with all it's flaws, I can't recommend it to anyone! Specially knowing that this ONE gamemode was part of another game!

Perhaps if they fix the core issues (spawning, hitbox detection, etc) and add more gamemodes AND lower the price to 10€ or less, then and only then it might become worth it!

For now, it's a big NO NO. Not recommended!"

								At the first time there were tickets that should give you an access to play Battle Royale, this obviously didn't make any money for developers, so they decided to split a 20€ Early Access game to two 20€ games (now you actually have to pay 40€ to get ""both"" of their games in Early Access. They promised that the game is going to be F2P at some point, but instead of that, they decided to make even bigger moneygrab. Once I thought that Early Access games are here because the devs want to get feedback from the community, to make a better game, to track bugs and so on. But that's obviously not true anymore. Early Access games are here to steal your money - at least Daybreak is.

If you want to play a real Battle Royale, go and grab Arma III, after all - Battle Royale was developed mainly for it, this game only stole it."

								Its been out for a year now and theres still no new weapons or content in the game. You either find an AR15, Shotgun, AK47 a pistol, helmet, body armour, bow, moltov, grenade, flash, or one of 3 pistols. Thats literally the spawn options. In ARMA 3 you get all of the A3 weapons (50+) and more with mods, even in rust you get more of an option and the games not even supposed to support battle royal.

I understood this when H1Z1: just survive and king of the kill were one game as the zombies and the survival were the main priority as thats what the game was but now they have made it into a standalone I expect to see much more, so far the only thing ive noticed is the hit markers and bug fixes."

								When I first got this game a few months back, I was having a blast. While the game was glitchy and a bit overpriced, I was happy to give support to a game that was trying to get some community help, and would eventually sell a FREE product. A couple of weeks ago, the game slpit into 2 parts, BR and Survival. I personally only played the survival once and I didn't really have that jolly of a time, and I primarily played BR. However, while I now own both parts of the game because I was grandfathered in and recieved both seperate games, I find it absolutely ridiculous and unfair for them to split into 2 games, charging consumers more for games that are buggy, terribly optimized, and in some cases unplayable. I believe that Daybreak has not hired any new developers, so what was the point of splitting the games into 2 if the same exact people are working on the 2 seperate parts? I would be a little bit more understanding if they hired 100 more developers and we got concrete evidence that there will be changes that benefit the performance of the game but so far that is not the case. This game made a HUGE MISTAKE breaking into 2 parts, and unless they recombine the two games, I do not recommend getting either version of the game. Hopefully Daybreak will learn their lesson and stop being greedy idiots who make a money grabbing game."

								I cant really tell you what the big hype for this game is. I think the big thing that gets me is the constant bugs. Bugs from getting stuck on the ground when landing, going underneath the map, getting stuck in the cars, and fences.The game is great if you take away from the bugs but it does need a lot of work.The biggiest problem i have is a2 shotgun rounds point blank in the head doesnt kill someone with no helmet, but an ar15 going after someone with a helmet can kill me with 4shots with full health. The game logic doesnt add up and from playing this game last year to now, this was still a major problem they had. After a year of this being a standalone, i really cant see the big issues being fixed. But besides the bugs the combat is really fun when the bugs arnt happeming. You will always be surrounded by people keeping your guard up most of the time.

Pros
Driver cars
Lots of ppl to fight off
Gotta lead your shots
Plenty of guns
random bombs will drop on you
Lots of buildings to enter

Cons
The gas moves to slow needs to be sped up
Bugs ruin the game
couple of cheaters (every online game has em)
Shotguns dont work most of the time"

								If you live in ANZ I implore you, do not buy this game. Purely because most of the time the ques take hours to get a game not only that but you have to be on a certain time. 

Your only other option is to play on other regions but if your connection isnt the best it can be (a new mechanism daybreak introduced to stop others from other regions) from the lobby you get locked from switching weapons or drawing them, melee hitting etc so when you drop in you can't do much. 

You can Drive, pick up and drop items but can't use them, you can prox chat open doors that's about it so unless you have a group that has a free slot and you want to act as a walking piece of loot container I would not recommend the game what so ever. 

It had alot of promise but there's all talk and no action to fix issues that have been around like described above since the game split from H1Z1 to King of the Kill and Just survive as two different entities.

If you're from another other region you'll most likely find it good but for my reasons and many others from ANZ I would not recommend this game."

								Its a great game to be honest. Haven't really met any hackers, I've seen multiple people get banned (there is a small notofication in the middle of then screen if someone gets banned). The updates actually makes a difference, some good some bad. And we have a new map coming out soon. I hope..

That being said I can understand why some people got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of when they split the game in two. But so far if you asked me, it has been a good thing. Atleast for KoTK. Can speak for the other one because I don't play it."

								Okay I'm gonna start this off with the fact that for the most part, King of The Kill can be a very fun game to play with friends. Killing others is satisfying and the gunplay has a learning curve that may take a while to get used to (it took me about 2 months). I personally feel like i got my 20 dollars worth. However, this game has more issues tan you can count. The main issue is that the developers are greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who just want yor money and don't really seem to care about anything but your money. This game was intended to be free to play after it was finished, but just recently they made the content that was oroginally $20 to $40. Instead of giving us updates with bug fixes and more content that will make the game more complete, the devs decided that they would spend the majority of their time just harvesting our money via case openings. The developers priorities are ♥♥♥♥ing embarrasing, sorry for the language. A few months ago they removed molotov cocktails since they had some sort of bug going on with them. They haven't been put back in the game, and im assuming the devs just figured we'd forget about them because the update after they removed, they decided we didnt want fixed game mechanics, instead we wanted new undies. That's right, they released an update after removing the molotovs thats main purpose was to add a few new character skins, and change the color of their underwear. I honestly can't understand their thought process when they first started the game it had such promise, but now they've smeared ♥♥♥♥ all over those promises and made themselves possibly the worst developers of all time. Buy this game if you like killing people and simply that. If you expect the game to be more than justs uing the same guns and cars every game, you will be dissapointed. The game lacks content severly, but it is damn fun to kill someone who's been trash talking you (which will happen pretty much every game since the community is just a bunvh of edgy children)

If I were to give this game the rating it truely deserves it would be a 1/10."

								This game doesn't even make sense anymore now when it has been splitted in 2. 
First of all, it has way too many bugs. Like falling through the ground. 
And second of all, I don't recommend you to buy it until it is free. WITHOUT BUGS.
Third of all, They changed the game completely. Looting is ♥♥♥♥, and the connection to the server is also ♥♥♥♥. The looting is completely different. Way to hard to find good weapons and way too laggy."

								Do not purchase this game.  Do not support unethical price gouging.
The developer has a long history of releasing buggy, unoptimized, and overall terrible games ripe with microtransactions, and this one is no different.  They LIED about it going free to play, and then split their game in half, doubling the total price before it's even out of Alpha. This is not okay! 

This change is nothing but a dirty cash grab.  Daybreak as a company has a track record of failure and will do anything to try to get out of the red, and this is a prime example.

They haven't released a quality game in over 15 years.  With all due respect to their employees and their livelihoods, this company should have been abolished years ago.  It has been driven into the ground repeatedly by poor management, and compounded by lousy investments from both Sony and Columbus Nova.  

No one talks about it, but there is no guarantee this game will even be available to play in months, let alone years. In 2014 Daybreak (then SOE) reportedly lost Sony $60 million, and now just one year after being sold off, this is the kind of gouging they're trying to pull on customers.  Not enough red flags for you? They've had multiple huge layoffs over the years,  at times completely devestating their customer support and quality assurance teams.

If your battle royale itch needs scratching, I'd recommend Rust or ARK. Both games have survival and BR modes, both are backed by more committed developers that aren't just there to separate your money from your wallet."

								Don't support these devs. Game is not 'early access,' as they say. It's a full release and includes crates, microtransactions and they split the game to make more money. Battle royale is decent but not worth paying for if you have Rust, Arma 3, etc...

Was really greedy of them to make skins not marketable. Forces you to open crates to get skins instead of getting them free.

								Okay so let me just start off by saying just don't buy this game. Biggest waste of 20 bucks there is. Bought this game a long time ago before the two h1z1's separated and you know I played from time to time. And so the separation came and I forgot my password like some of us do as well right? Yeah so I feel like playing this game for the first time in a month but I'm locked out of my account. All cool I try to reset my password but in order to do this I need to provide a secret question that I CANT RECALL MAKING. So I decided to write to the support of H1Z1 in order to get my account back and so I see some pages that they have on getting your account back and stuff and I see :

Real name:
Daybreak Username:
Name on Credit Card:
The last 4 digits of the Credit Card used on the account:
Current answer to your Security Question:

And thats the information I cant provide since I don't know the answer to my secret question but Hey theres another option -

If you do not have all of the above information, please prepare as much of the following information as you can:

The full billing address:
E-mail address:
 
And I'm like alright let me do that then and so I do then I wait 2 days for a response which is pretty ridicolous. Okay all good they reply but their response is that I need to provide the answer to my security question before we keep going with the recovery of the account which as I already said I didn't make therefore I don't know the answer to. And I say so in the reply but they keep on insisting on the security question which I don't know and the guy said that if I don't answer he will close the support ticket and so he did. Overall decent game, terrible fu*king support not worth it once you lose your account it's gone cause the people that are suppoused to help don't do anything to help :)"

								Around 170 hours so far and I can clearly say that this game is so bad on so many levels , the hit reg , pvp, loot in the map, glicthes, and bugs . everywhere .....

every single person is gonna move to another battle royale game when another company makes a better version of it

Edited 1 : So many new tweaks and fixes , the game is definitely improving , still needs alot of work tho"

								This is a fun game, but i cant recommend it because the devs put more effort into money whoring skins hen they do making the game playable. Then they release a giant update making the game completly different before they even bothered to fix the game in the first place. If you're reading this day break (which you arent because you're too busy jerking off to the amount of microtransaction cash you're raking in when your player base is getting frustrated) then you need to fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game. STOP RELEASING SKINS AND FIX YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!"

								Steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ made by the most incompetent developer team in the world. They legitimately can´t fix ANYTHING in this game without causing something else to break. You wait a month, two for the next patch just to find out that the majority of the issues aren´t addressed, some bugs are months and months and months old. Servers are some of the worst in the industry, de-sync is at least a full second in this game and after most of your deaths you'll be left with legit question marks above your head on how did you just die?!?! Skill gap in this game is very little because of how random it is and inconsistent. You can Two tap one guy and then a minute later witness majority of your bullets do nothing to the next guy and end up dead, get a frame skip where your game legit freezes for a split second or get crazy lag/de-sync where you peak back behind the corner but the guy still gets a shot or two or ♥♥♥♥ing two taps your ♥♥♥ even though you got behind cover. Hit registration is just awful and the guns in general are inconsistant, especially shot gun. Sometimes you one shot kill someone full health 10 feet away and the next time you stick your shotgun into the guys mouth, deepthroating him to no effect, not even a gag. Basically, you're rolling a dice in every gun fight. 

TL:DR. This game is garbage and i hope DayBreak sells it to some big time Publisher that will pass it to a competent dev team to piece it together. Then i hope that the whole staff of DayBreak studios buys themselves tickets to a cruise and hits an iceberg, causing the ship to sink."

Now its expecting me to wait 15 minutes for that. Or 3 minutes just for a solo queue. Thats dumb. They made the game worse. As of 2/19/2016 dont get this game. Very dumb.

								Do Not Buy This Game! This gamemaker is 100% focused on money. After 35 tweets, 10 e-mails and several attempts trying to contact them otherwise, I still got no respond. Not even a read confirmation. I record all my gameplay and uploaded several video`s for daybreaker where it clearly shows a hacker. No response... Now my account has been stolen and they expect me to re-buy the game. Which costs 40$ for both games nowadays. 
The game is ruled by hackers and no fun at all if I look back at the time I spent on this game. I was always busy trying to capture hackers. 
Do Not Purchase This Game! It`s endless frustration because of hackers!"

								Let me tell you about this game.
This game gets huge amounts of hate for a lot of various reasons.

What people dont remember is that this is a game still in testing and isn't a full game.

The game definately has its issues and bugs which i know the devs are working on, but this game has huge potential.

If top streamers and players stopped playing it as a completed game and treated it as a game still in testing, it would get much less hate.

That being said i still talk smack about this game in anger too, but i also understand they will eventually fix the issues in the game, unlike in csgo's case were valve wont fix the game and ONLY care about money.

Yes this game has crates and stuff, but they are still releasing updates that fix bugs and stuff more often than games like Dayz.

I still recommend this game despite the issues everyone craps on DayBreak about.

								The game has some good points but a quick run down of the bad points:

Enjoy your 5-10+ mins waiting time if you want to play 2's or 5's as a solo player.
If you alt tab out of the game while in a que, the game gets stuck on a loading screen you can never leave aless you end the game on task manger.
Still a cheating problem in solo/2's/5's where people will refuse to kill each other from other teams and will gang up on you. (i have reported these players nothing happens even though it is against the rules) < lol ye right...
Usual amounts of racism/hate/toxic players > people telling you to ""kill yourself"" are still allowed to play the game for some reason?
Hit reg is much MUCH worse than csgo's infamous 64 tick servers.
If you jump out of a speeding car and someone shoots at you for the first couple of seconds nearly all of their shots will miss you because the server thinks you're in a different place.
Car physics, loooooooooooooool. What else needs saying.
Eu servers are full of children which such high pings you cant kill them. (although i hear americans have this problem on their servers too?)
Shotguns STILL dont work. They have never ""worked"" correctly. Even when this game was a standalone game and not split they never worked.
The game has still not even been remotely optimized.

Im not sure how many servers the company runs but its honestly a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Each server takes in 100+ players but the wait time is outrageously long no matter what time of day you play.

I cannot recommend this game in its current state. (I dont ever see things getting better) devs dont care and just want your money for crates/skins.

Edit: I'm from the UK for plebs commenting that ""im from some 3rd world ♥♥♥♥ hole"" loool no, if you are racist or shilling for the company i will remove your comment.

								I've deleted my previous review and decided to write a new one!

They're liars, money diggers, incompetent, and almost completely unprofessional however they have turned the game into something much better, the graphics are beautiful now and I can hardly notice any hackers around anymore.

Here are the things you need to consider before buying this game though:

1- You'll need a really good graphics card because the map isn't optimised and the fps will be low as ♥♥♥♥ so make sure you have a $100~$150 VGA Card at least (Like a GTX 950 or something and don't expect 60 fps), not because of the gaming experience and that ♥♥♥♥, it's just because if you play it on less than 70% render quality and low resolution you won't be able to see the difference between a player and a tree branch and you'll just keep dying without knowing who the f**k is shooting you and from where.

2- You need friends to play this game otherwise your teammates will kill you or you'll get bored quick.

3- Buy it on sale because it's not worth $20, unless you don't really care and want it bad.

4- No matter how far we go, the game will always be glitchy as f**k and with every update they fix a few bugs and add a few more.

5- Basically, don't expect that you'll be able to just launch the game and have a lot of fun at any time because no matter how good things are going, they always manage to f**k it up somehow!

Buy the game ONLY if you have no problem with the things I've written above, especially #1!"

there is no gas mask can be found in BR.

dev team please fix this issue, otherwise players are wasting there mony buying skins.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
let's get back to the gameplay itself.

this game is fun indeed, but you soon get bored becasue of  limited variety of weapons.

The combat pace is not well-tuned yet.

 The map is too big for BR mode so players spend most of the time traveling to safe area, but

any confrontation might kills you in 10 secs. It is frustrating."

								Trust the bad reviews. 


I had several hundred hours before they ""split"" the game (effectivly lowering productivity by 50% and breaking several parts of the game) because i hoped and prayed that semi-frequent updates were a good sign. They wernt.

Between the cheaters, glitches and all around incompletness of the game after....however many years now, i can not recommend anyone to play this game. Rather than fixing these issues, they release more microtransactions. Another example of incompetancy was when they finally claimed to fix 1 pre-game bug that was a little annoying (exploding car/tombstone); then before even releasing said update, decide to do away with the whole lobby system instead for apperantly having some massive internal revelation of a better way to have a pregame lobby.

 If you dont see why this is an issue, then youre probably dumb enough to play this game. This game is spinning its wheels and going absolutely nowhere. They still have the same handful of items since launch (their wiki lies and says 660, but they include airdrop tickets, emotes, and shl tty variations of the same item; like backpacks). 

And the worst thing? China has got their hands on it, which is the coalmine canary of video games. Anyone over the age of 15 knows that once the chineese start playing a game enmasse, its days are numbered.

The company is run by morons and my harddrive feels lighter for doing away with it."

								pros:
fun game when it works like it should

cons:
micro-transactions in alpha
constant crashes & freezes
server lag
badly optimized

The last 3 I mentioned are things you would expect with a game that is in alpha, but given its extremely slow progress over the years, a release with a fully functional game feels very unlikely and therefore I'm going to assume it will always have these issues.

Do not buy unless you are fine with playing a game that will probably never be fixed."

								This is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever seen.

only four things in the game work properly:
field gauze
field bandaid
field medical kits
.44 magnum

nothing else in the game works
the leader boards are always wrong
the armor is either rng based or it increases the damage you take instead of reduce it
stun grenades never work
frag grenades have a 50/50 chance of working
damage from all guns is rng
there is about a 10% of killing someone by shooting them in the head even though the developers says it is 100%
ATV are not for any terrian 
jeeps are also not for any terrian and are made of paper
""bullet travel time"" is about 1 second every 10 feet
the devs lie about fixxing problems in updates
even the exit button does not work so you are going to restart your computer to just leave the game"

								I have a few hours now, so its finally a time for a review. And as i start, i still am debating if its positive or negative.

Its a fun game. When it is in its sweetspot, it is one of the best games ive played. With a full 5 man team you can have some of the best tactical gameplay ive experienced. Even in solo it doesnt get boring. The community lacks the salt i have seen in others, well negating the salt brought on by the game remembering that its still early access.

That brings me to the huge negative point. It is so broken. Ive headshot hatters from 1 foot away and not killed them with the flopgun (it doesnt bring justice to shotguns so it shall not be branded as one). Ive been 1tapped while wearing a helmet, and in turn 1tapped people with helmets on. Ive landed next to a car, jumped in and driven for about 10 seconds before it randomly explodes. Ive been top 2 and disconnected for idling while fighting the last guy. Ive shot at people standing still and nothing registers, and they turn around and 2tapped me (china No.1 ping). Ive parachuted in and reached the floor and the game goes 'NOPE' and i go through the floor and carry on until i reach the deamons below. I can go on, 60 hours (at time of review) is alot of time for bugs, in this game at least.

But i am still drawn to it. You cant recreate the feeling of winning in this game, especially if you earn that win with lots of kills. No matter what the people at TheybreakGames throw at me, i keep coming back. So when the game is working fully, in my opinion it will be very hard for anyone to beat.

Overall i would reccomend, but the key thing to remember is this: 'If some random crap happens to you, its not just you'. Got killed in some rediculous way? that person is probably dying right now in some other equally as rediculous way. That is the way of this game, but god damn its fun."

								Even though I like Battle Royale, I'm giving this game a negative review because you can't trust these developers. They split a 20$ game which was originally going to be free to play, into two 20$ games which aren't going to be free to play. 

They doubled the price basicly, and it's a ♥♥♥♥ move from a ♥♥♥♥ company.

Honestly don't buy, because this kind of behaviour from a developer shouldn't be accepted, and we as a community can show them that."

								The game described in two words: empty promises

ALL OF YOU IDIOTS THAT BUY ♥♥♥♥ING CRATES AND UNLOCK THAT ♥♥♥♥ ARE TO BLAME FOR THIS GAME. BECAUSE YOU KEEP GIVING THESE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S MORE MONEY THEY DON'T DESERVE.

Also they keep making these tournaments and ♥♥♥♥, pretending like they have full game, meanwhile game is in ALPHA STAGE BRO, and some bugs are beyond annoying. ♥♥♥♥ this game man, and ♥♥♥♥ me for buying it a long time ago.

Below is the list of all the ♥♥♥♥ these disgusting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s did to us supporters of this mother♥♥♥♥ing game:
- game mode that you pay for by round: the game has game breaking bugs and they pull this ♥♥♥♥ off
- a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of crates that you open with real money obviously
- events made to promote the game and make twitch ♥♥♥♥♥ stream their game = free advertisment for the game
- fake trailer that shows things like night that are not even in the game or animals that ♥♥♥♥'s no where man, all LIES
- split game, now you pay twice for same game that cost 20 € before, and costs 2 x 20 € now. It's gonna cost even more, 30 € when it's ""done""
- lied about how big map will become, yeah that won't ever happen

And much much more of the ♥♥♥♥ that I already forgot.


If any of this is true, developers are also being treated like GARBAGE

								Literally the worst game devs of any video game ever. Instead of working on the game breaking bugs and glitches, all they care about is cash cow-ing their broken game with in-game apparel and streamer-focused events. I've had this game long before it split into two (which by the was was the ♥♥♥♥♥iest decision anyone could have ever made for any video game) and somehow the game has gotten worse since then."

								The game would be far better if the bugs that have existed for months were actually fixed. With every ""patch"" they release more problems seem to occur as a result. Bump into a rock at idle speed in a vehicle with full health and it blows up, get shot in the chest with armor that doesn't get damaged, ridiculous drop shotting that they will never fix, terrible desyncing issues, jumping through walls on office buildings, roof exploits, hits that don't register. But they add a new reticle which wasn't necessary, change the fire rate of the AK, and a few other things that really didn't matter, very disappointing. It has so much potential to be a great game but the development team seems to have no intention of fixing actual problems with the game."

I will change the review to positive the day the devs are more interested in solving all the game's issues rather than putting new crates and items for sale.

								I got to top 8 today and I was pretty confident about winning the whole match. Then the game suddenly decided to lock my weapon just before an easy kill, even though I had no problems with my connection at all. 0/5. I'd never recommend anyone a game that has as many bugs as this one even if it had potential, or even if I still play it almost daily. I'm going to update my review if they ever decide to fix the game, and I think it's pretty ridiculous that it's still so buggy even after all the time Daybreak's had to develop the game."

there is no gas mask can be found in BR.

dev team please fix this issue, otherwise players are wasting there mony buying skins.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
let's get back to the gameplay itself.

this game is fun indeed, but you soon get bored becasue of  limited variety of weapons.

The combat pace is not well-tuned yet.

 The map is too big for BR mode so players spend most of the time traveling to safe area, but

any confrontation might kills you in 10 secs. It is frustrating."

								I got both H1Z1 games as I bought it early but it cant excuse the fact that they are trying to make more money by making one game into two games which is a ♥♥♥♥ move toward the new players base. The game includeed microtransactions before the game even finished.

								Alright, I've spent well over 300 hours in this game, but that doesn't make it a good game. In all honesty, it's garbage. Now what's really good about King of the Kill is concept. I love what they're trying to do, it's fun to parachute down, loot up on guns, and duel out to be the last man standing. Also a beautiful map. BUT, the bugs in this game are insane, there's just way too many bugs in this game. Daybreak doesn't do their job on fixing a game that has so much potential! You can run into a bathroom to grab a medkit, and somehow get stuck between the toilet and the shower and then you have to log out because you can't move. You can run your car over the tiniest bump and you're gonna flip and blow up. I watched Dr. Disrespect get rammed by a quad for about 30 ft. When he was driving a jeep, that just shouldn't happen. SHOTGUNS are broken. You're 10 ft. From your opponent, shoot him dead in the chest no body armor, and he doesn't die and you get dicked over and say ""REALLY DAYBREAK"". And the game is insanely graphically demanding. Better throw $500 into your Graphics card so you can get 60 fps, and since they made it so you can't remove shadows your fps just drops and it's so hard to play, and I have a beefy gpu. Oh god, and Chinese players. DAYBREAK! THEY'RE ALL THE WAY IN CHINA PLAYING ON NA SERVERS, THEY LAG ♥♥♥♥ AND MAKE IT DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO LAND A SHOT ON THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE RUBBER BANDING SO HARD, FIX THIS GAME PLEASE!"

Or dying to dsync behind trees, cars, walls, driving or getting disconnected at random.
Or dying to a cheater, that taps you from 500 meter range - while standing on a moving truck?!

								It really is not worth the money at this point but is still a ton of fun. 

Its fun and addictive until you start questioning things, then it becomes monotonous, tedius and just plain rage inducing.
These 'things' include, but are not limited to, hackers, lack of content, bullets not registering, sniper shotguns and more hackers. Yeah this game really could do without the hackers! 

Either way it is good fun and I'm having a blast, just don't question things and you'll love it. (IMHO though, it probably isn't worth your money in this current state)."

								H1Z1 BR is a great game. When it comes to the survival mode, the map seems a little bit small for me. However, the map is great for the Battle Royale mode. The only problem with the game is the issue of players using hacks in games. I know DayBreak has been banning tons of people who hack, but the issue still remains. I still recommend this game but it may be a bit boring if you play too many games."

They single handedly ♥♥♥♥ing destroyed this game with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing graphics change that was unnecessary, and somehow made it buggier than before and ruined every aspect of the game players loved in the early access.

								Game flickers like crazy in any settings above medium, in fact it is knwon that anything above medium is broken yet developpers let the settings high and ultra available to pretend it is there but in reality it just fools the user.
Edit: in fact manually setting LightingQuality to 0 and make UserOptions.ini read only is a manual fix.

You even have parachute control key mappings hardcoded in the game, you can change most of your key mappings but not for the parachute, the most important thing in the gameplay...

In game there is a lot of lag even on the server of your region, to pick up an item you have to repeat the operation like 3 times without even moving a bit in order for your command to get registered by the server. Just to pick up a gun on the ground it can take 5 seconds being a sitting duck.
Edit: and very-very often commands like the use of medkit are not taken into account which means death if you don't double check if the healing icon appear on the lower right of the screen.

I could also talk of the game physics that are so crap that they're hillarous.

Also the recoil of the guns is not like in any clever game, here recoil never resets so it means that you have to constantly reaim for all bullets fired and for people with a standard monitor it is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because of remanency.
Those crap dev could try to play Half-Life 1 which is 20 years old and done it correcly on release.

Edit : last game i got killed by an obvious cheater, so there is decomplexed cheating.

Finally this game is just promises that might never be delivered."

								I think half of my playtime hours is the game not responding

UPDATE: Can't even play now since apparently my account doesn't exsist anymore, good job DayBreak

 Poorly managing their game  I can't believe I've wasted so many hours and so much time with this game and its company. ""Early Access"" has become just an excuse to poorly design their games and leave them to die while they work on their next one. It's disgusting how much money they make by making new games, then not managing them. You can't even make a base. And you know what? Once I open the game now, I get an error that states my account is no longer registered, yet when I try to create a new one the email address is already used. Even if I were to try to fix this, I don't feel like supporting DayBreak or their merchandise.

 Broken/Crashing Alright, even the biggest H1Z1 fanboys will admit, without a doubt, that this game is BROKEN. Let's face it. The biggest challenge to this game is getting it to work properly. ""But hey, it's just Early Access! So it's okay!"" Nah not really. Especially when this company is makin' the big bucks. Do you know how long this game has been out? How many players there are? If Daybreak cared, they would please their consumers, but no, they continue to gain profit off their terrible game design.

 To anyone who wants, or plans to buy this game, please don't."

								Just as one thought that this game couldnt become any worse, they made it even more about the money and micro-transactions. 
Developers has completely abandoned the gameplay experience and apparently given up on trying to fix the many flaws in the game, and made it all about opening expensive cases and getting rediculous cosmetics.

								I could write about all of the bugs and problems with this game, but that's something most of you have heard proably over 10 times. Instead I'm going to write why I, with over 200 hours played, love this game even though I know and experience all of the recurring problems with near every match.

H1Z1 isn't perfect, but it's still, imo, the best battle royal game on the market. It is truly one of the easiest to play and enjoy, it is fun with friends and has a strong competitive side to the solos of it, as well as scrimmages hosted by third party h1 streamers or fans. This game is playable in many different ways, you don't have to be amazing at this game to win or progress far into a match, you can play with varying differnet playstyles, whether it be agressive or relaxed.

All in all 9/10

My only major complaints/problems with the game are:
 -The lack of ping lock, allowing other region players (Asia mostly) to play on NA servers and pretty much flying around on your screen making it very hard to kill
 -The lack of banning for people who team up in solo matches
 -The fact that the November update still hasn't come out... and it's December.

*Post-December Update Edit*

So, the game was FINALLY updated... we got a new season (or preseason), we got some new skins, they sorta kinda fixed the shotgun and they fixed one of the major exploits... was this patch good? No. Was it bad? No.

Daybreak has some major issues at their headquarters, they are either understaffed or just dont give a ♥♥♥♥ when it comes to this game sometimes. To their credit they did address one of the major problems, the shotgun and now its about 95% consistent, which is much better than the 50/50 you'd get pre-patch. However, there are still many exploits and bugs they haven't addressed. Daybreak I know you care about your fanbase and want to see this game do well, so for the love of god address some of these issues please!

 - Ban. Teamers. In. Solos. Add a different reporting technique for reporting teamers rather than Ctrl+R, perhaps do Ctrl+""any other letter"" if you see this player is teaming in solos... It's the most frustrating thing ever to be killed by teamers in solos, believe me.
 - The snaking/prone glitch was addressed in the most recent patch, yet people are still doing it... fix it. Don't allow for people to get into a car while prone, simple. There's no reason that you would legitimately ever need to get into a car while prone if you WEREN'T trying to preform some type of exploit.
 - Reduce the solos que time in lobbies. The wait time, once you spawned into the Fort Destiny Box used to be like 90 seconds, now it is around 150 seconds, I know we're talking about the difference of a minute but it's noticable and quite annoying, at least lower it to 120 and meet in the middle."

								In it's current state KotK is one of the most buggy and broken shooters you'll find. With poor optimisation and a company driven by nothing more than money with no regard to it's player base, Daybreak is really pushing the limits. 

On the other hand, the game concept is something you won't find elsewhere in this style and it has a lot of potential. Once you're actually able to join a game you'll see that graphically, it looks fairly nice (with the odd few clipping errors here and there). Gameplay wise the game is very balanced too, in which respect a new player is able to join with absolutely no disadvantages or advantages other than personal experience. Although money hungry, all microtransactions are thankfuly kept cosmetic. 

You'll compete to be the last man (or team) standing in games of up to 200 odd people at peak times. Winning won't come easy and you'll likely be faced with tens or even hundreds of loses before you reach that end goal. With enough practice and determination you'll get there, and it will feel great.

There is a fairly large learning curve which may take a while to get the hang of but if you're willing to put in the time and practice, it will prove rewarding. Along with that, the community isn't so bad either, you'll meet some nice people and have hillarious encounters although as with any game there is a fair bit of toxicity. Of course if it's not for you, you can always toggle voice chat & stick with friends in teams of up to five. 

You'll spend countless hours in this game having your patience tested while you wait in a thousand player queue and if you have a short temper you'll easily rage at the poor servers & game breaking glitches/bugs cutting your game short that you'll certainly come across. Along with that, idealistically, you wan't a better PC than the recommended on Steam due to it being so intensive.

However, overall the game is something painfully amazing. If you're someone who is willing to look past the bugs every so often and if you enjoy competitive & 'tryhard' player vs player action, then this is certainly a game for you."

								I'm writing this review because i was just in a game with a friend, everything froze for me for 8 seconds and when it worked again the car had exploded and killed us both. The game before that we had to start again, because he got kicked, the game before that we got oneshotted by obvious hackers, the game before that 15 people spawned near me and i had a reload bug.

I think you get what I mean, the concept is awesome and the late game is thrilling, but the developer decides to push 25 skin crates and twitch events instead of fixing the most broken game I've played for a long time.

In a good, skillbased multiplayer game, you control the outcome of a fight and you are to blame for your loss. In h1z1 it's not your fault 75% of times."

								As Much as I loved this game since Release I can't recommend this game because they've just dragged out everything for ingame skins/Cosmetics and small bug fixes that take them forever to patch they nerfed the AK-47 which is beyond useless now and It's just overall a Garbage game with a Garbage Community and you shouldn't feed more money to Daybreak.

I've played at least 100 Hours of BR to have a decent say in how improvement has come along overtime and they're just not doing anything to improve gameplay instead they're just going for easy money with Ingame Skins and Market Transactions. 

In my Opinion since the game split they've lost so much Multiplayer Traffic, I do hope they work hard so that maybe one day I can reinstall the game but for now The Culling is overal some fresher content to play so I do recommend that.

								Having played a lot of Battle Royal in H1Z1 (before they split the game), I can say this game mode is pretty fun. But, it is just ONE game mode. So, ask yourself if it is worth buying a 20€ game for just ONE gamemode, a gamemode previously part of another game!?

-----

Daybreak claims that they will be adding more gamemodes, but that's yet to be seen. We don't know what gamemodes or how many will be added. Reading the early acces page they claim to add additional gamemodes and game rules. Judging the history of this game/development, I would not be supprised if they only add slight variations of the ONE gamemode Battle Royal.

Before the split, there already where 3 variants of this game mode, you had one without zombies, one with zombies and one with special rewards for winning! This last mode was behind a cash wall and you need to buy tickets for real hard cash to join this mode.

Technicly they could say they have 3 gamemodes. Then you have the same game with team of 2, or team of 5 players. So there you have it, 5 gamemodes! :P

We have to wait and see what the new gamemodes are, if any are added!

Ask yourself, knowing this, is ONE gamemode still worth 20€?

-----

Let's inform you some more, because this game has a rocky history with many claims that never became reality!

They ones claimed to NEVER add pay2win mechanics to this game, then airdrops where added to survival mode that gave you food, water, weapons and ammo! Airdrops are behind a paywall from real hard cash! Though they changed the way this works but still ...

They claimed this game would become free2play ones released. Guess what, it's 20€ with additional supply crates and cosmatic microtransactions! Even payed gamemodes like the Battle Royal variant (Green Dawn) and airdrops for ingame loot.

Again, ask yourself, is this game worth 20€, with possible new gamemodes behind cash wall, with micro transactions and many broken promises?

Then the worst part, the recent split of H1Z1 into two games. 

This game, King of the Kill, was part of the original H1Z1. You had survival servers and Battle Royal servers! Now you have the survival game, 20€ and the battle royal game for another 20€! And what would happen if say a new gamemode is added to King of the Kill, which becomes very popular, will they split agian? Who knows!?

This split would not be the worst of things, if they cut the price in half. Would be fair since they cut the game in half but nope, now you pay 2x20€ for something that ones was 1x20€, for something that ones was promised to be free2play!

Also, remember you now need to pay double for microtransactions. Getting a new piece of clothing from a microtransaction was universal availible for all servers and gamemodes. Now, if you want that same piece of clothing be prepared to buy the same item twice!!!

Knowing all of this, ask yourself is ONE gamemode worth 20€?

-----

With this out of the way you might want to know if this ONE gamemode is fun and yes, I said I have lots of fun with this gamemode. So let's get into that!

You spawn with around 150 other players on a large open map. Everyone drops down from the sky with a parasute. It's now time to land as fast as you can, so you can be the first to loot weapons, ammo, backpacks and more. So you can be the first to blast others in the face.

After a few minutes a savezone is drawn on your map, because toxic fog will be released and slowly drive you towards the savezone. This mechanic is fun and usefull to drive the remaining players towards the same spot.

Though there is only ONE map it's big enough to be fun for a long time. Mainly because a lot of things are random. Not the map itself but your spawn location is random, weapon spawns are random and the savezones are random. One match ends in an urban location and another on top of the mountains.

All seems good, but there is also a lot wrong with the game and it's mechanics!

Spawning for example! You don't spawn at the same time as your enemies. It depends on your loading time, internet connection and random bad luck (sometimes the game takes 2 or 3 times longer to load). This means people with faster hardware and internet connection land faster, getting guns fasters and thus have an increased change to win!

Next problem is that hitbox detection and netcode are so random. With a bit of bad luck you can shoot somebody in the head for multiple times without them dieing. While other times you one hit kill them.

Same with the shotgun, it's spread pattern is random. So you can almost get sniped from long distance with a shotgun while other times you can't hit/kill somebody at close range! And it's all luck, or badluck depending how it ends!

On top of that there aren't many weapons and in the end it comes down to AR15 for long range, shotgun for close range. Perhaps the AK47 (though it got nerved) or if you are lucky the hunting rifle (sniper that only drops from airdrops). All the other weapons are just useless compared to the above, so bows, crossbows and pistols are ignored! You only use them if they are the first weapon you can find early game.

-----

Eventhough this gamemode is a lot of fun, even with all it's flaws, I can't recommend it to anyone! Specially knowing that this ONE gamemode was part of another game!

Perhaps if they fix the core issues (spawning, hitbox detection, etc) and add more gamemodes AND lower the price to 10€ or less, then and only then it might become worth it!

For now, it's a big NO NO. Not recommended!"

Battle Royal is a gold mine concept that is in its infancy in such grand scale. This game is very close to getting it right.

I've never waited more than 3 minutes to get in games of 130-150 players. Here's a chart of concurrent players on an hourly basis peaking at 12pm-2pm (12k players)and lulling at around 3am (3k players) if you're worried about having people to play with.

								H1Z1 was launched as an Early Access title priced @ $20 and the announced business model was ""Free to play"".  At the start of the month (Feb. 2016) they gave notice that come February 17 2016, they`ll scrape the free to play model and split the game into two titles, as follows:


- H1Z1: Just Survive @ $19.99 (your standard multiplayer survival) 

- H1Z1: King of the Kill @ $19.99 (""competitive"" game modes like Battle Royale)


New players, avoid this, you`re esentially paying double for the same content we already have and they`re not even out yet, who knows how many business model changes this will undergo. Great game or not, vote with your wallet and do not support unethical business practices. Bleh."

								This company, much like many in the past, is running a borderline scam here. They have no problem adding crates to the game in every patch to generate revenue (aka profit), but do not fix the issues that give this game a reputation as a bug-filled joke. Shame on this company and shame on the dev team - I will not support this money-grab anymore. Buying this game will just add to the problem - don't do it!"

								Thank you Daybreak for giving me another opportunity to give a bad review. 

Seriously though, from day 1 H1Z1 has hardly improved. There has been some 'stuff' added but they spend all their time on releasing [crates] skins for the kids. How about improving the combat mechanics and give us a game that is about PvZ and not PvK (players vs. kids). 

H1Z1: King of the Kill. The best copy/paste game of all time."

								Im so diasapointed with Daybreak right now. 

They hype this uptade, lot of things gonna get fixed. what happends? its even more ♥♥♥♥ then before. im glad that i bought it in early Alpha so i dont have to pay 40€ for both games when i payed 20€ for both.

King of the kill (or whatever)... its even more laggy now than before. items doesnt even spawn some games, som games 50 people fall to their death because you chrashland. 

Daybreak, a tip for you. kick everyone that works with the game and hire new people, that actually now what they are doing. and stop being such a money sucker. 

Its been nearly a year! and you havent even fixed the ♥♥♥♥ing scoreboard yet. took you nearly one year to understand that both of the helmets sucked. that the AK was to op. that ATV was bugged and you died sometimes when you used it. 

do i recommend this game? sorry, but after this huge fail of an uptade. NO!!!"

Shotgun is broken, still no fix.
Phantom bullets, still no fix.
♥♥♥♥♥♥ hitreg, still no fix.
Cars exploding randomly just in front of you, or at the begining of the game, still no fix.
HUGE lag on every servers, no one cares. (well actually, players do, Daybreak don't gives a ♥♥♥♥)
15 mins queue to get in a game, to get instantly disconnected or glitched in a car.


On the other hand, Daybreak will proudly provide every player a ♥♥♥♥ ton of skins crates to open for only 2.5€ each.

								This game doesn't even make sense anymore now when it has been splitted in 2. 
First of all, it has way too many bugs. Like falling through the ground. 
And second of all, I don't recommend you to buy it until it is free. WITHOUT BUGS.
Third of all, They changed the game completely. Looting is ♥♥♥♥, and the connection to the server is also ♥♥♥♥. The looting is completely different. Way to hard to find good weapons and way too laggy."

								H1z1 King of the kill is great game with funny idea. Playing with friends is fun and even solo can be enjoyable.
Kotk is in early acces so when you buy the game you must be aware that it is not complete and has multiple annoying bugs (or funny ones) I personaly got killed by a door at start of duo game. 
If you like hunger games and run and shoot kind of games you should enjoy this one.

								The amount of hate for this game is astronomical, yet warrented.

I have a ""clan"" of about 5-10 guys mostly based in the east coast of the U.S, for the longest time, we would only play two games, CS GO and Civ 5.  As you can imagine, it eventually got stale and was slowly toxifying our relationship due to the nature of CS GO and Civ 5.  I should mention that we are a mostly competitive group, so getting dicked on in Civ or berating each other in CS GO was getting old after 1-2 years.

Eventually, two of the people in our group decided to pick up the game, much to my disgust.  I remember when it was supposed to be free, then it became $20, then they split it up into TWO games for $20 each which left me appalled.  I also had a VERY sour taste in my mouth for early access after Cubeworld, DayZ Standalone, and about every other Early Access game that had come out.  Yet my two friends raved and raved about how much fun they were having, to which I would respond ""50% rating on steam"".  

Well, after deranking from LEM in CS GO, I decided that I was done with that game for a while, and I needed something else to take my attention.  I ended up playing a lot of The Division, which was another game chock full of broken promises, but I enjoyed it a lot.  

So I eventually got tired of The Division and caved in and bought the game, and man oh man was I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when I first launched it.  I crashed out of my first 3 games.  Which is ridiculous considering I have an i5 4440 and a GTX 970.  After 3 hours of troubleshooting I launched it up and went into my first solo game.  I got 9th place, and was hooked.

If any of you have ever played minecraft hunger games or even vanilla rust, you know the feeling of adrenaline when you get into an intense fight.  This game delivers, and rewards you time and time again for your aim *not the shitgun though*.  My friends and I were laughing at the bugs *cars doing gymnastic flips* and working together as a team in Fives.  Losing does not feel that bad in this game as you can instantly load into another one without having to worry about any ""rank  loss"" *cough* CS GO *cough*.  All in all, this game is a bug riddled mess with greedy ♥♥♥ developers, but if your looking for a game to just load up and play with friends, then I think this is the game for you."

								Splitting the game and charging double is a joke that deserves all the negative reviews.

And if we go past that the good bad about this game:

+ Battle Royale is fun

+ It's crazy

+ Fast paced

+ Plenty of fun

+ Allows group play / Most likely very awesome small lan game

+ It's mad fun to observe and Invitational proved that.

+ You kill a kid and wonder why doesn't parents step in when they hear all that insults done by screaming.




-  Gameplay is bit clunky and odd.

- Someone said you are supposed to bunnyhop all over the place to dodge

- Developers screwed over people not just once, but twice. I guess it's modern standard?

- Plenty of bugs and picking items is pain in the butt.

- You shoot guy in the chest from close range twice. Then the person kills you with 2 pistol bullets and you die. Still has 100 health. 

- Your hardware dictate the game too much. By the time you land there is guy with big visa loan with shotgun at your face.

- As i am editing this message, new match has been 10mins old and only handful of guns has spawned. Yes massive battle royale is going with fists.


It's not hopeless game, but requires rapid updating and fast. Plenty of bugs, cheaters and what else. Falling under world, no gun spawns, getting one tapped into bush from half the map away and what else stupid there is in store for players. Personally my best is sudden car explosions.

I'll edit this to positive if they start updating the game and fixing all pesky bugs. Right now i would think twice if the game is worth buying specially when you don't get two for one."

""THE GAME IS UNOPTIMIZED AND RUNS HORRIBLE. IT CRASHES ALOT AND IT LAGS EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE ♥♥♥♥!""
said the guy with the $300 dell laptop

The game runs fine if you actually put some money into building a semi decent pc. The game also looks good if you're able to turn up the graphics.

As for the cheaters, I am constantly seeing cheaters get banned. 

""The devs don't work on the game at all!""
Ignition?
Skirmish?
Weapon updates?


Long story short the game is good if you have a decent pc."

								(My playtime is very low as its the first time playing since the H1Z1 game split)

I really don't know where to start.. I tried to play for just over an hour, about 15 minutes was actual game play. The game constantly gets stuck on loading screens (entering the game or loading the lobby) and only took me back to menu once after a game, the rest of the time it crashed.

Graphically the newer map does look better but its still nothing amazing and the sounds are mediocre at best.

As for the gameplay, its exactly how I remember it being before the split; Awful. I drove my car at full speed right through a player and he got away without a scratch... Then later on while being chased full speed by a police car, the passenger jumps out (still at full speed) and instantly 1 shot kills me while I'm still driving.

If you want a very arcadey/broken game, buy this. But be warned, you'll want to smash something out of frustration!
Save your money for when PlayerUnknowns BattleGrounds comes out, that game is legit!"

								They messed up the servers and plus now when i go to log into my MAIN account it doesnt even bother loading me into the game and just kicks me to the website saying that I am using a different account from when i bought the game (not true only have 1 account) and even tried to fix it by flowing the steps listed in support so I changed both my username and password and just guess what happened. Yup. Kicked right back to the same page saying the same crap.

								Even though I like Battle Royale, I'm giving this game a negative review because you can't trust these developers. They split a 20$ game which was originally going to be free to play, into two 20$ games which aren't going to be free to play. 

They doubled the price basicly, and it's a ♥♥♥♥ move from a ♥♥♥♥ company.

Honestly don't buy, because this kind of behaviour from a developer shouldn't be accepted, and we as a community can show them that."

								Steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ made by the most incompetent developer team in the world. They legitimately can´t fix ANYTHING in this game without causing something else to break. You wait a month, two for the next patch just to find out that the majority of the issues aren´t addressed, some bugs are months and months and months old. Servers are some of the worst in the industry, de-sync is at least a full second in this game and after most of your deaths you'll be left with legit question marks above your head on how did you just die?!?! Skill gap in this game is very little because of how random it is and inconsistent. You can Two tap one guy and then a minute later witness majority of your bullets do nothing to the next guy and end up dead, get a frame skip where your game legit freezes for a split second or get crazy lag/de-sync where you peak back behind the corner but the guy still gets a shot or two or ♥♥♥♥ing two taps your ♥♥♥ even though you got behind cover. Hit registration is just awful and the guns in general are inconsistant, especially shot gun. Sometimes you one shot kill someone full health 10 feet away and the next time you stick your shotgun into the guys mouth, deepthroating him to no effect, not even a gag. Basically, you're rolling a dice in every gun fight. 

TL:DR. This game is garbage and i hope DayBreak sells it to some big time Publisher that will pass it to a competent dev team to piece it together. Then i hope that the whole staff of DayBreak studios buys themselves tickets to a cruise and hits an iceberg, causing the ship to sink."

								The fact of the matter is this is a awesome concept and scratches the right itch I had as a competitive gamer, however, Day Break Games seem to value gimick releases over actually fixing the game they have. This game has been in Early Access for years now and it still plagued by Blocker level bugs that just never get fixed. 

Please, vote with your dollar by spend it elsewhere. As much as I would love to see this game succeed, I cannot recommend you purchase it at this time. I firmly believe the money will not go to support this title and just be wasted by the Studio Heads who on Glassdoor are portrated as unquailified and not concerned with making great games but making a dollar."

								The game has some good points but a quick run down of the bad points:

Enjoy your 5-10+ mins waiting time if you want to play 2's or 5's as a solo player.
If you alt tab out of the game while in a que, the game gets stuck on a loading screen you can never leave aless you end the game on task manger.
Still a cheating problem in solo/2's/5's where people will refuse to kill each other from other teams and will gang up on you. (i have reported these players nothing happens even though it is against the rules) < lol ye right...
Usual amounts of racism/hate/toxic players > people telling you to ""kill yourself"" are still allowed to play the game for some reason?
Hit reg is much MUCH worse than csgo's infamous 64 tick servers.
If you jump out of a speeding car and someone shoots at you for the first couple of seconds nearly all of their shots will miss you because the server thinks you're in a different place.
Car physics, loooooooooooooool. What else needs saying.
Eu servers are full of children which such high pings you cant kill them. (although i hear americans have this problem on their servers too?)
Shotguns STILL dont work. They have never ""worked"" correctly. Even when this game was a standalone game and not split they never worked.
The game has still not even been remotely optimized.

Im not sure how many servers the company runs but its honestly a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Each server takes in 100+ players but the wait time is outrageously long no matter what time of day you play.

I cannot recommend this game in its current state. (I dont ever see things getting better) devs dont care and just want your money for crates/skins.

Edit: I'm from the UK for plebs commenting that ""im from some 3rd world ♥♥♥♥ hole"" loool no, if you are racist or shilling for the company i will remove your comment.

								Think about this. 

The game is still in Early access and the devs have allready done two of the most greedy things a developer can do. 

Microtransactions and to take a $20 game and split it in to two $20 games.  

So ♥♥♥♥ the Developers. Stay away from any Daybreak Company game!

								Has a DayZ feel to it. Delevopers dont do ♥♥♥♥ but release bad content like crates and skins. Last update they fixed 5 minor bugs while people still are able to exploit door closing and jumping to get access to otherwise unaccesable rooftops. 

Netcode is awful and has happened more than once where youre driving shotgun in a car and you shoot infront of your driver - Visibly a lot ahead of the driver - but still manage to hit your teammate in the face because the animation and hitbox arent in sync. Getting shot around corners is a constant threat and is just a part of the game by now.

Been a long time where ""pro"" players were able to just prone spam and run where you'd gain an advantage of hitbox moving - Alongside ♥♥♥♥ netcode made this almost luck to hit someone while they were doing so. Hasnt been fixed but they said it will be fixed next patch...

Shooting in vehicles again as shotgun can derp your gun and it wont reload a full mag but rather the amount you chose to reload at while in the car. Youre forced to empty the mag or either just reload to the amount before reload. Dropping and picking your gun up again will fix this but ♥♥♥♥ annoying.

Cars randomly drop into the ground, explode or go full speed for no reason without you touching keys.

The community is ♥♥♥♥ in solo BR. People team up and theres done nothing to prevent it. When a special event was live called Green Dawn everyone just had to accept that the last 10 players most likely were a mixed group of teamers. A patch which disabled several people in one car in these solo queues only made it more likely that they were on foot. 

The report key is pathetic and no action is taken. Could just aswell remove it.

People load it differently. You can be shot by someone you havnt loaded in yet and they can see you but you cant see them. Only happens at long ranges though. Still stupid that players dont load in same way as cars does at range and is always present. 

And so on. Lots of issues, little or no action is taken to fix these. Could be the same issue with DayZ where a very small team if developers are supposed to take care of this game which a rather large fanbase which no where near covers the need. 

Game has potential - Not worth buying at the moment.

EDIT: 
Bonus info after seperation and patching you now get hitmarkers!
Those hitmarkers are so unreliable even the chinese would call that ♥♥♥♥ back from the factory.
Your thirdperson camera is now so clunky it gets blocked by the flies flying around and you get the feeling of being in a badly cut south african slum movie.
0/10 for effort on that patch. Atleast we can see that you killed people with a grenade now! Awesome."

								I dont usualy write negative reviews, but this game and it's technical page (if that's the right expression) is absolutely garbage.

Don't get me wrong the gameplay and mechanism is all really decent. Its fun to play with friends, even solo. But when it comes to technical things I'm about to lose control and hit something.

Talking about optimization in this game is probably main stream and I don't fully mind having 45-60 fps. but when I can't even alt+tab. Not even accidentally because then it ♥♥♥♥s up so hard that I have to force the shut down of the PC then is something wrong. And it's not even alt+tab, I can't even exit the game the way it's supposed to be exited. Cuz of black screen again and yea next shut down approaching. have to exit the game through task manager, and its like 75% change. On 25%  it won't let me so, forced shut down or try to sleep my PC which is like 50% chance aswell.

Actually I could talk ♥♥♥♥ about this game all day long, but I feel like there is no purpose, people won't even read this or just leave negative thumb because they are the ones that like the game and they don't want to see negative reviews. 
So I'll end it here with words. That the gameplay is kinda good, if u have really good PC u probably can maxed out the ♥♥♥♥ out of it and have good fps and probably u won't experience things I do.  But I hope it gets better for people with normal PC's.

Didn't want to write this but after last playing I just had to. it was too much for me.

Sorry for my englando and have a nice day lads, you will do better if you buy other games. Just sayin' :)"

								I have a few hours now, so its finally a time for a review. And as i start, i still am debating if its positive or negative.

Its a fun game. When it is in its sweetspot, it is one of the best games ive played. With a full 5 man team you can have some of the best tactical gameplay ive experienced. Even in solo it doesnt get boring. The community lacks the salt i have seen in others, well negating the salt brought on by the game remembering that its still early access.

That brings me to the huge negative point. It is so broken. Ive headshot hatters from 1 foot away and not killed them with the flopgun (it doesnt bring justice to shotguns so it shall not be branded as one). Ive been 1tapped while wearing a helmet, and in turn 1tapped people with helmets on. Ive landed next to a car, jumped in and driven for about 10 seconds before it randomly explodes. Ive been top 2 and disconnected for idling while fighting the last guy. Ive shot at people standing still and nothing registers, and they turn around and 2tapped me (china No.1 ping). Ive parachuted in and reached the floor and the game goes 'NOPE' and i go through the floor and carry on until i reach the deamons below. I can go on, 60 hours (at time of review) is alot of time for bugs, in this game at least.

But i am still drawn to it. You cant recreate the feeling of winning in this game, especially if you earn that win with lots of kills. No matter what the people at TheybreakGames throw at me, i keep coming back. So when the game is working fully, in my opinion it will be very hard for anyone to beat.

Overall i would reccomend, but the key thing to remember is this: 'If some random crap happens to you, its not just you'. Got killed in some rediculous way? that person is probably dying right now in some other equally as rediculous way. That is the way of this game, but god damn its fun."

								The developer has a long history of releasing buggy, unoptimized, and overall terrible games ripe with microtransactions, and this one is no different. They LIED about it going free to play, and then split their game in half, doubling the total price before it's even out of Alpha. This is not okay! 

This change is nothing but a dirty cash grab. Daybreak as a company has a track record of failure and will do anything to try to get out of the red, and this is a prime example.

They haven't released a quality game in over 15 years. With all due respect to their employees and their livelihoods, this company should have been abolished years ago. It has been driven into the ground repeatedly by poor management, and compounded by lousy investments from both Sony and Columbus Nova. 

No one talks about it, but there is no guarantee this game will even be available to play in months, let alone years. In 2014 Daybreak (then SOE) reportedly lost Sony $60 million, and now just one year after being sold off, this is the kind of gouging they're trying to pull on customers. Not enough red flags for you? They've had multiple huge layoffs over the years, at times completely devestating their customer support and quality assurance teams."

								Was good, then horrible updates. It is ♥♥♥♥.

EDIT: the recent update was rather good and changed the game for the better and I must say it is enjoyable. I still do not recommend purely because the game it self is still a bit crap in terms of the performance and bugs. It is getting there though.

EDIT: More updates comes more trash. Once again it is not worth the filth it was built on.

EDIT: Biggest failure.

								If you live in ANZ I implore you, do not buy this game. Purely because most of the time the ques take hours to get a game not only that but you have to be on a certain time. 

Your only other option is to play on other regions but if your connection isnt the best it can be (a new mechanism daybreak introduced to stop others from other regions) from the lobby you get locked from switching weapons or drawing them, melee hitting etc so when you drop in you can't do much. 

You can Drive, pick up and drop items but can't use them, you can prox chat open doors that's about it so unless you have a group that has a free slot and you want to act as a walking piece of loot container I would not recommend the game what so ever. 

It had alot of promise but there's all talk and no action to fix issues that have been around like described above since the game split from H1Z1 to King of the Kill and Just survive as two different entities.

If you're from another other region you'll most likely find it good but for my reasons and many others from ANZ I would not recommend this game."

								At the first time there were tickets that should give you an access to play Battle Royale, this obviously didn't make any money for developers, so they decided to split a 20€ Early Access game to two 20€ games (now you actually have to pay 40€ to get ""both"" of their games in Early Access. They promised that the game is going to be F2P at some point, but instead of that, they decided to make even bigger moneygrab. Once I thought that Early Access games are here because the devs want to get feedback from the community, to make a better game, to track bugs and so on. But that's obviously not true anymore. Early Access games are here to steal your money - at least Daybreak is.

If you want to play a real Battle Royale, go and grab Arma III, after all - Battle Royale was developed mainly for it, this game only stole it."

								Not a bad game, I would go as far as to say its a good game, even with it being in early access. The bugs/lack of content is understandable, but the amount of ♥♥♥♥♥ that this company gives about there game and buyers is a big fat ♥♥♥♥ing zero. They dont seem to update this as nearly as often as they should, and when they are working on the game, it is either focused on just the battle royale portion, or figuring out a way they can ♥♥♥♥ over the people that are paying for their product by spending time they should be working on the game to come up with a plan where they split the game in two charging you more money to play both modes, and completly abandoning the whole original idea of it going FTP. 

Decent game, bad company. Until this company decides to give a ♥♥♥♥ about there game/consumers, and not just the extra pennies they can stick in their ♥♥♥ for safe keeping, I do not recommend this game."

Couldn't even create an account - ""We're sorry, but you are unable to sign up for a Daybreak Account at this time.""
Tried this for about 30 minutes then gave up, played Overwatch, had a good time with a game that actually lets you play it after you buy it.

EDIT: Apart from this whole thing at the start, it's an alright game once you get into it. Worth buying if you like games like this, just look it up on youtube."

								Honestly I saw a lot of potential in this game but it quickly became apparent that it's just a money grab. Game mechanics have hardly changed since day one, items are being taken out of the game instead of being fixed because it's so buggy your pc would crash sometimes if you threw a molotov. I don't expect this game to survive long enough for it to even go into beta, since it has been alpha early access for more than a year now, and the only things that get added are items and cases so you'll spend more money outside of the €20 you spent on the original game.

It's actually very disappointing how bad the game is, because the idea is great and I still like to play it with friends, but the bugs, glitches and crashes really grinds my gears until the point where I don't want to play it anymore.

I'm really hoping this game will crash and burn soon, as it deserves."

only four things in the game work properly:
field gauze
field bandaid
field medical kits
.44 magnum

nothing else in the game works
the leader boards are always wrong
the armor is either rng based or it increases the damage you take instead of reduce it
stun grenades never work
frag grenades have a 50/50 chance of working
damage from all guns is rng
there is about a 10% of killing someone by shooting them in the head even though the developers says it is 100%
ATV are not for any terrian 
jeeps are also not for any terrian and are made of paper
""bullet travel time"" is about 1 second every 10 feet
the devs lie about fixxing problems in updates
even the exit button does not work so you are going to restart your computer to just leave the game"

								Playing this game is like trying to eat a 5 star meal on cardboard funiture with a lava pit below you. Alright, the concept is great, having the safe zone that shrinks, the parachuting at the beggining, the team selections, ect. The problem? this game probably has the least experienced devs in the world, or atleast the laziest, maybe ♥♥♥♥♥iest. The most recent bug patch they put out literally fixed 0 bugs. 

Bugs they said they fixed:
Spam crouching - Still a thing
Glitched reloads - Worse now then before
Cars turbo being stuck - Still broken
Cars driving off when you get out - Still happens

List of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ features and glitches no one is going to fix:
Shotgun - You Might as well use a dull knife (sometimes does damage, sometimes not)
Lamps - Will blow your car up in miliseconds
Cars Exploding randomly - Ever touch the bottom of your car with a wierd object? Did it explode? It will in this game.
Parachutes - Who knows, maybe you will fall through the ground, maybe you will die when you hit the ground, maybe you will spawn without one, maybe it will depsawn when you're half-way to the ground.

Hit registration.... No words, it feels like bullets have a randomly generated percent chance to do damage. You just never know. ♥♥♥♥ this game, ♥♥♥♥ the devs, and ♥♥♥♥ the community too."

								If you have followed the progress of this game since launch it has proven to be far too much for the developers to handle. The countless amount of bugs caused me to stop playing the game a while back and as far as I can tell from the twitch community its just as bad as it once was.

								I've Played enough for most... Wins All the time. But lets be honest. This game is absolute trash. Daybreak refuses to fix their issues... Like I dont know.. REGION BLOCK! I have Extremly Good internet. This game is so lop sided with people that have high ping dancing and glitching all over the map taking shots at you behind pillars, two tapping behind rocks, and of course the famous RUNNING THROUGH WALLS. This Game has gotten so much WORSE over the time that daybreak has gotten its grips on it. The only consitant thing about the H1Z1 KOTK servers are that they are inconsistant. Shots don't connect, they fly through peoples faces point blank even getting giant blood splatters and people still end up with 100 health easy pz. This game has so much potential.. Sometimes the game runs smooth and your shots connect. But thats like 1 out of 10 games played.

Word of advice... Don't buy this game. It will only ♥♥♥♥ you off with how terrible the Devs are at coding... RUN! RUN NOW"

								King of the Kill is like drugs, you're told that drugs are bad and you know they're bad but you do them anyway. H1Z1 is exactly that, a bad game that is so satisfying and fun at the same time it just keeps bringing you back in for more. If they stop making crates and focus on the games many bugs and glitches. This game has the potential to be one of the best PvP oriented ""Hunger Games"" style games out there. But with many companys money hungry for any profit they can get. Daybreak has not focused on improving the game but somehow making the game worse with each little patch. 

Overall Score: 7.5/10

Pros: Good Pvp, fun with friends, satisfying gameplay
 
Cons: Lots of bugs and glitches, terrible car mechanics, stupid chinese people, money hungry company, stupid skins and cases."

								Splitting the game and charging double is a joke that deserves all the negative reviews.

And if we go past that the good bad about this game:

+ Battle Royale is fun

+ It's crazy

+ Fast paced

+ Plenty of fun

+ Allows group play / Most likely very awesome small lan game

+ It's mad fun to observe and Invitational proved that.

+ You kill a kid and wonder why doesn't parents step in when they hear all that insults done by screaming.




-  Gameplay is bit clunky and odd.

- Someone said you are supposed to bunnyhop all over the place to dodge

- Developers screwed over people not just once, but twice. I guess it's modern standard?

- Plenty of bugs and picking items is pain in the butt.

- You shoot guy in the chest from close range twice. Then the person kills you with 2 pistol bullets and you die. Still has 100 health. 

- Your hardware dictate the game too much. By the time you land there is guy with big visa loan with shotgun at your face.

- As i am editing this message, new match has been 10mins old and only handful of guns has spawned. Yes massive battle royale is going with fists.


It's not hopeless game, but requires rapid updating and fast. Plenty of bugs, cheaters and what else. Falling under world, no gun spawns, getting one tapped into bush from half the map away and what else stupid there is in store for players. Personally my best is sudden car explosions.

I'll edit this to positive if they start updating the game and fixing all pesky bugs. Right now i would think twice if the game is worth buying specially when you don't get two for one."

								graphics 6/10
sounds 8/10
gameplay 7/10
     
(first of all, Im not a native speaker of english so there might be some grammar mistakes, hope u ignore them and understand me. :)

Im not gonna talk about the game much, this article is mostly about a spesific problem that I and many people  have. 

Its fun exept having a stupid spawn system, weird physics, many bugs which is pretty normal for such a new game in alpha so not really a big problem for now.

But there are many simple and small bugs that would be really easy to fix them for Developers - Creators of the game like the Steering wheels of vehicles not steering, door-jump bug, and many small things that i cant remember atm. 

A big part of this game is skins, almost everybody like them and have different nice skins, but we all  have to wear our skins every single time on waiting lobby before match, I think it would be really easy for Daybreak squad to make an option to Set skins as custom outfit on main menu or something like that so we wouldn't lose time on every begginning of a match. 

But the biggest reason of the game making me cancer is the developers of the game that they dont care about players, There are thousands of players who has the  ''Overlay not displaying with shift+TAB'' issue but %90 of them can't solve it properly and creators of game never publish an official solution or a patch to fix it. The thing that I cant understand its we all know such a greedy - stingy company is DayBreak, But many people can't buy keys-cases because of the shift+TAB problem, But they are insisting to not solve this damn issue and let people have fun. Its annoying A.F. When people text me from steam, I cant answer without pressing ALT+TAB, I cant buy keys-cases in no way, when my friends invite me to lobby i need to ALT+TAB again. 

I bought this game approximetly 1 year ago, trying to fix it since last summer, spent around 6-7 hours to fix and haven't done a progress at all. I hope someone sees that, rather than seeing that, i hope they give a **** about that, cuz im really having fun with this game and my fun-meter would increase 150% if the steam overlay would display."

								Its been out for a year now and theres still no new weapons or content in the game. You either find an AR15, Shotgun, AK47 a pistol, helmet, body armour, bow, moltov, grenade, flash, or one of 3 pistols. Thats literally the spawn options. In ARMA 3 you get all of the A3 weapons (50+) and more with mods, even in rust you get more of an option and the games not even supposed to support battle royal.

I understood this when H1Z1: just survive and king of the kill were one game as the zombies and the survival were the main priority as thats what the game was but now they have made it into a standalone I expect to see much more, so far the only thing ive noticed is the hit markers and bug fixes."

								Do not buy any of the games, dont support the devs with your money.

Imagine a game that has very little content, is poorly optimised, and is in pre alpha.
Charging 20 dollars for that is absurd imo, now imagine half of the game being cut and sold as separate games, both costing 20 dollars. wich means you have to pay 40 dollars for the complete game, when earlier you only had to pay 20. wich was already too much imo. 40 dollars for a game with very little content is just absurd, and to top it of, it's buggy as ♥♥♥♥ and filled with hackers, and nothing is being done about it.

The game has some potential, Battle royal is fun to play when it's not bugged out and hackers aren't flying everywhere. But i wouldn't hold my breath, the devs dont seem to care about the game at all."

								Okay I'm gonna start this off with the fact that for the most part, King of The Kill can be a very fun game to play with friends. Killing others is satisfying and the gunplay has a learning curve that may take a while to get used to (it took me about 2 months). I personally feel like i got my 20 dollars worth. However, this game has more issues tan you can count. The main issue is that the developers are greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who just want yor money and don't really seem to care about anything but your money. This game was intended to be free to play after it was finished, but just recently they made the content that was oroginally $20 to $40. Instead of giving us updates with bug fixes and more content that will make the game more complete, the devs decided that they would spend the majority of their time just harvesting our money via case openings. The developers priorities are ♥♥♥♥ing embarrasing, sorry for the language. A few months ago they removed molotov cocktails since they had some sort of bug going on with them. They haven't been put back in the game, and im assuming the devs just figured we'd forget about them because the update after they removed, they decided we didnt want fixed game mechanics, instead we wanted new undies. That's right, they released an update after removing the molotovs thats main purpose was to add a few new character skins, and change the color of their underwear. I honestly can't understand their thought process when they first started the game it had such promise, but now they've smeared ♥♥♥♥ all over those promises and made themselves possibly the worst developers of all time. Buy this game if you like killing people and simply that. If you expect the game to be more than justs uing the same guns and cars every game, you will be dissapointed. The game lacks content severly, but it is damn fun to kill someone who's been trash talking you (which will happen pretty much every game since the community is just a bunvh of edgy children)

If I were to give this game the rating it truely deserves it would be a 1/10."

								Well,H1Z1 KOTK is a nice game.People might call the Devs Money Grabbers because they splitted H1Z1 into H1Z1 King of the Kill and H1Z1 Just Survive.Everyone whines about his 200+ Hours they spent in this Game before the split.You get both Games when u bought the Game before the split,pretty fair in my opinion.The Game itself is pretty nice optimised,sure there are still some bugs and other things that should be fixed,nothing big at all.The BR Mode didnt change at all,just a the new Air Drop System,Scrappy yard and the new Z2 Map.I liked the previous Z1 Map more but thats a matter of taste (or tactic :P).The only thing im missing are SMGs since we have 4 pistol calibers but the only thing Devs release are new crates with more skins.People also cry about Cheaters in this Game and Just Survive.Battleye is one of the worst Anti-Cheat Programs every made (besides Punkbuster) but for some reason its doing a pretty good job in H1Z1."

								Over 150 hours put into game before split, sure there were bugs but the game was relatively smooth... after split, insane queue times for BR, still same bugs. glitches, and hackers, extremely laggy for no apparent reason (both KotK and Just Survive) AND they're charging people $20 per game mode. Absolutely unbelievable. Daybreak screwed up so ♥♥♥♥ing bad with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and they're losing SO many players/customers if they don't fix it. Complete waste of money as it is right now. Just a money grabbing game to ♥♥♥♥ you over"

								S**t game
Dev crew Sleeping since they made this game 
Shotgun = **Tarded
Hitreg= Bad asf
Lagg= massive
Queue time = AGES (Bring back BOX of destiny)
NEW UPDATE
Grenades not exploding
Hit reg= still f*cked
Queue time = longer than gameplay
They ain't doing sh*t when a player abuses the rules
Randomly step out the car and being bugged

								I've played this game many hours and mostly with having fun, but the devs dont give a single ♥♥♥♥ about the game.

They release a new update with some ♥♥♥♥ing skins you cant even sell on the market and ppl try hard the ♥♥♥♥ out of them and play at least in a team of two.

But thats not the only negative thing about the game.
The Developers dont do ♥♥♥♥ about the game and its still alpha after 1 1/2 years of doing nothing but making money and ♥♥♥♥ing the ppl that spent money for their ♥♥♥♥ing buggy ♥♥♥♥ game. Dont buy it, trust me the game is just ♥♥♥♥ing cancer."

								H1Z1 was meant ot be a single game where you could choose either pure pve or pve + pvp as most games, In the early access they stated that it will become free to play eventually, needless to say, they did not keep their word, not only they split the main game into two seperate modes (games), pve and pvp but also put the same hefty price tag for their ""new"" offspring. Greed got the upper hand it seems...  As if the skins weren`t enough already!"

The game isn't that bad when it comes to actually playing the game but it's not worth the wait. 10/10 best waiting simulator!

								Too broken, ive had  atleast 3 different types of car glitches, not enough veichles to get away from the smoke, people running thru closed doors, also you can't even heal in the car as passenger while your buddies driving;then theres dying in less than a sec after landing, wouldnt it just be easier to have a 10-30 sec safety looting period for people who just landed, so they dont get shot by those who have already been looting 5 min before them. I think it's important since i occasionally or always land in already started match...



now i cant even get in the car for fear of it killing me, nor can i even rely on doors to do their job: all of this in one match and don't forget the bullets that seem to go through anything."

								The amount of hate for this game is astronomical, yet warrented.

I have a ""clan"" of about 5-10 guys mostly based in the east coast of the U.S, for the longest time, we would only play two games, CS GO and Civ 5.  As you can imagine, it eventually got stale and was slowly toxifying our relationship due to the nature of CS GO and Civ 5.  I should mention that we are a mostly competitive group, so getting dicked on in Civ or berating each other in CS GO was getting old after 1-2 years.

Eventually, two of the people in our group decided to pick up the game, much to my disgust.  I remember when it was supposed to be free, then it became $20, then they split it up into TWO games for $20 each which left me appalled.  I also had a VERY sour taste in my mouth for early access after Cubeworld, DayZ Standalone, and about every other Early Access game that had come out.  Yet my two friends raved and raved about how much fun they were having, to which I would respond ""50% rating on steam"".  

Well, after deranking from LEM in CS GO, I decided that I was done with that game for a while, and I needed something else to take my attention.  I ended up playing a lot of The Division, which was another game chock full of broken promises, but I enjoyed it a lot.  

So I eventually got tired of The Division and caved in and bought the game, and man oh man was I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when I first launched it.  I crashed out of my first 3 games.  Which is ridiculous considering I have an i5 4440 and a GTX 970.  After 3 hours of troubleshooting I launched it up and went into my first solo game.  I got 9th place, and was hooked.

If any of you have ever played minecraft hunger games or even vanilla rust, you know the feeling of adrenaline when you get into an intense fight.  This game delivers, and rewards you time and time again for your aim *not the shitgun though*.  My friends and I were laughing at the bugs *cars doing gymnastic flips* and working together as a team in Fives.  Losing does not feel that bad in this game as you can instantly load into another one without having to worry about any ""rank  loss"" *cough* CS GO *cough*.  All in all, this game is a bug riddled mess with greedy ♥♥♥ developers, but if your looking for a game to just load up and play with friends, then I think this is the game for you."

								I gave it a chance. I've been playing since day ♥♥♥♥ing one, before the split, before the crates, before the lizard squad DDOS'ing, before the firing of John Smedley. This being said, don't let my few hours fool you, I have over 800 hours in both gamemodes, before the split. This, along with H1Z1:JS, was good. It WAS good. But not anymore. Not at all. This pathetic excuse of a game has had ZERO progression since day one. More crates, more money. That's all they care about. The only major changes for this game has been a couple lighting changes, a couple new zombie/player models, and a couple new items. Other than that? Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing nothing. Not a single thing. Don't buy this garbage, don't buy their crates, don't support these jackasses that care about nothing other than more money. Please."

								Just as one thought that this game couldnt become any worse, they made it even more about the money and micro-transactions. 
Developers has completely abandoned the gameplay experience and apparently given up on trying to fix the many flaws in the game, and made it all about opening expensive cases and getting rediculous cosmetics.

A shame really, the game had potential in the beginning."

Would ignore negative salt reviews on steam again to enjoy this gem.

Battle Royal is a gold mine concept that is in its infancy in such grand scale. This game is very close to getting it right.

I've never waited more than 3 minutes to get in games of 130-150 players. Here's a chart of concurrent players on an hourly basis peaking at 12pm-2pm (12k players)and lulling at around 3am (3k players) if you're worried about having people to play with.

								15 pounds / 20 dollers for a 'MODE' that all other games offer as a free mod or server so what's special about this i hear you  ask...

There must be guns and features that are not in any of the other modes yes?... nope.. Still 2 rifles and 4 pistols.

Must be really good servers and great performance yes?... Nope. Expect 5 minutes waiting times and 2 man BR's where you get into a game without your partner.

If you want to play a game that offers BR, KOTH, Survival/Dayz then buy Arma 3. One time purchase (except some extra DLC content in form of the upcoming Nexus DLC - Massive TANOI map) and allows mods that offer a much better experience than this. 

Daybreak idea --> Copy A3/Dayz but make it more runable (Good idea) --> Make it Free To Play (Another good Idea) --> Actually Lets not make it free to play (erm ok?) --> I see people like BR so lets make more money by splitting it into two games (No.)

Don't Buy this until its been released or fixed or things worthy of being added are added.

I'm not angry im dissapointed."

								When I first got this game a few months back, I was having a blast. While the game was glitchy and a bit overpriced, I was happy to give support to a game that was trying to get some community help, and would eventually sell a FREE product. A couple of weeks ago, the game slpit into 2 parts, BR and Survival. I personally only played the survival once and I didn't really have that jolly of a time, and I primarily played BR. However, while I now own both parts of the game because I was grandfathered in and recieved both seperate games, I find it absolutely ridiculous and unfair for them to split into 2 games, charging consumers more for games that are buggy, terribly optimized, and in some cases unplayable. I believe that Daybreak has not hired any new developers, so what was the point of splitting the games into 2 if the same exact people are working on the 2 seperate parts? I would be a little bit more understanding if they hired 100 more developers and we got concrete evidence that there will be changes that benefit the performance of the game but so far that is not the case. This game made a HUGE MISTAKE breaking into 2 parts, and unless they recombine the two games, I do not recommend getting either version of the game. Hopefully Daybreak will learn their lesson and stop being greedy idiots who make a money grabbing game."

Then they release a giant update making the game completly different before they even bothered to fix the game in the first place. If you're reading this day break (which you arent because you're too busy jerking off to the amount of microtransaction cash you're raking in when your player base is getting frustrated) then you need to fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game.

								The game is an incredible lot of fun... If you can even get into a game. It took me 5 minutes to finally get into a game. It also crashed during the loading screen twice. Once I finally got into a game I randomly died minutes after landing by ""the environment."" Developers seem more focused on adding more bright coloured cosmetic items than fixing actual game-breaking bugs. I don't even know why I bothered buying an Early Access game.

Steam also refunded the purchase despite me having 3 hours on it, so that says a lot about the current state of the game."

								Valve should add a neutral rating to their ""Do you recommend this game?"" because that's the way I feel about H1Z1: King of the Kill. I'm in between ""Recommended"" and ""Not Recommended"". I went ahead and selected ""Recommend"", but I'm still neutral.

I bought H1Z1 in Dec. 2015 and enjoyed it for 40+ hours. After the split, my hours were moved to H1Z1: Just Survive, hence why I have 49 minutes played in H1Z1: Kotk. Though, I play H1Z1 on my second account: http://steamcommunity.com/id/easyhype/.

ReviewH1Z1: King of the Kill is a decent first person/third person shooter that will make you paranoid. Before, it was called Battle Royale (sorta still is), over a hundred people participating in what you would call a loot fast, listen, shoot, kill and look all around you to survive. You can select Solo, Duo and Fives. Playing H1Z1: King of the Kill is fun with friends and sometimes even solo play. They also have a ""Pre Season"" leaderboard where you can track your solo progress (kills, score, etc).

H1Z1: Kotk has around 25k+ players at minimum playing almost constantly. I've seen as high as a 73k+ player base at times. There's no shortage of people or queue times (they recently fixed queue times which made it pretty much instant to get into a game). Starting out, you'll wait in a lobby until the timer runs out for the game to start. Once the game has started you'll begin to parachute down to a huge map from a decent height to choose a spot that might have good loot or you can hover in the air, look where everybody else is going so you can avoid them as you parachute down. Most of the time it's about getting to the ground as fast as possible to gather loot or even a vehicle to have a better start for yourself.

Yes, loot and vehicles. There's only 4 vehicles: Truck, Jeep, Police Car and ATV. Truck is the slowest of them all, but it's also better than nothing. Jeep is the second fastest whilst police car and ATV will go faster than the rest. However, ATV can only hold 2 players, has no cover and it's typically only good for gathering its biofuel and key if you have an existing vehicle. The other vehicles hold 5 players. Vehicles will allow you to move around the map faster, but they do have fuel and health.

Loot, ahh yes. There's a lot of loot. RNG depicts where loot goes. Pistols, assault rifles, grenades, molotovs, helmets, armor (makeshift/lammy) and more! Loot is always something to make everyone fight over and I've had my fair share of experience with that. You can choose to go all out and loot everything you see or gather a certain amount of items and kill other people for their items instead. Try not to loot everything you see - There's bag space. You can have an ordinary backpack that holds 1200~ weight or a military backpack that holds 2200~. Each item you loot will take up bag space. Becareful looting though, players can easily pick you off while you're looting. I've had bad experiences with that too.

I think the most lethal to you besides those pesky serial killers we call players is the toxic gas. The gas is released after the safe zone is revealed and the 5 minute timer is up. Before that you'll need to be near that safe zone circle or you're toast. The gas will get powerful as the game progresses so you'll always need to be a step ahead of it. I've even used the gas to my advantage. Know where the gas is going to spread to and if you're in the safe zone & the enemy isn't you can fire at them, drop their health and the gas will do the rest (given they are still in it). It's amusing when that happens. Although, I've had my fair share of gas deaths.

I can't really say much about their graphics in the game other than they aren't that great at max settings. My settings are on low so I can see other players better (mainly just lighting off, shadows low, other is medium to high). It's best if you tinker with your settings to find it easier to see items and players much better without much darkness.

H1Z1: King of the Kill has a crate system. The game isn't pay to win, it's just cosmetics. They even have a ""scrap"" system where you can scrap items for the scrap currency and turn scrap in for more items. Their skull system allows you to back yourself in solo play. If you do well in solo play you'll earn skulls once bet. After leveling every 5 levels you'll also receive free unlocked crates to open; otherwise, playing the game will earn you locked crates you can sell on the steam community market.

The feeling you feel when winning a game is pretty intense at times, until you realize there's no rewards for winning.

Bugs, Early Access & FrustrationsLet's not forget H1Z1: King of the Kill is still in early access and it does have a lot of issues. This is what makes me neutral about this game. They do release updates every month or so, but I feel like there's not enough hotfixes to fix common bugs or updates to the game to bring in different mechanics, items, features, etc. 

The most common bug I run into is stuck parachuting. You're hovering above the ground whilst the parachute is still intact and will force you to exit the match, but normally it ends up crashing your client instead. Second common bug is parachuting under the world, forcing you to logout and again it'll crash the client instead. Not to mention the glorious amount of loot bugs where some loot has sunk into the ground, object its on, etc.. It'll even cause the ammo to do the same depending if any objects are near, the ammo will go inside of that object and you won't be able to loot them. Let's also not forget a large amount of objects floating in midair.

I think the most frustrating part of H1Z1: King of the Kill is how static the map is and the places you never parachute down to anymore. It would make gameplay experience better if their map or map objects in general was procedurally generated. Of course loot is random based on RNG, but I feel like the map should have a significant difference almost every playthrough.

I ask myself every time I play H1Z1: Kotk, ""How come we never spawn at the Dam anymore?"". In the old map it was so fun parachuting down to the dam, gathering loot and killing people since the place is FULL of loot. Nowadays to even loot the dam you need to be lucky enough to spawn close by, get a vehicle (preferably jeep/police car/atv) and drive 3 minutes to arrive there. You'll have roughly 4 minutes to loot the richness of the Dam, but it's worth it since nobody goes there anymore..

I feel like the utilization of the map edges A-J 1-10 is horribly lacking. They only have it where people are spawned more inside of the map than on the sides.

The second most frustrating thing is, they removed the rewards for winning or coming in top 10, 20~. Back in 2015 you used to receive a loot bag that you can open. Depending on how well your position was in a game you'll get a better loot bag. But, when I came back to H1Z1 early 2016 that was removed. Winning or dying at a certain number is no longer rewarding. The only thing you have is bragging rights and that's not really incenitive to keep playing besides the Solo Season, which is 1% better than being rewarded with item(s).

There's more issues to this game that I feel could be resolved. I think there's more things Daybreak can do to H1Z1: Kotk since it does have potential. Would be nice if they introduced new weapons or new items in general, game modes, etc - That's the potential this game has, but development is quite slow and hotfixes are almost always non-existent.

OverallH1Z1: King of the Kill as I wrote is a decent game, but it's on a bad development path with redundant decision making. Now you know why I'm completely neutral about this game.

								H1Z1: King of the Kill is a rushed, poor excuse for a game. The core mechanics show some potential yet the game is riddled with bugs, glitches and just random acts of programming (E.G Death to Doors and Fences).

If the developers actually worked on the core gameplay, instead of pumping out useless cosmetic items, you would probably have a better game.

If your tossing up on buying this game, save your money, look elsewhere. This ♥♥♥♥ stain isnt worthy of my toilet."

								I could write about all of the bugs and problems with this game, but that's something most of you have heard proably over 10 times. Instead I'm going to write why I, with over 200 hours played, love this game even though I know and experience all of the recurring problems with near every match.

H1Z1 isn't perfect, but it's still, imo, the best battle royal game on the market. It is truly one of the easiest to play and enjoy, it is fun with friends and has a strong competitive side to the solos of it, as well as scrimmages hosted by third party h1 streamers or fans. This game is playable in many different ways, you don't have to be amazing at this game to win or progress far into a match, you can play with varying differnet playstyles, whether it be agressive or relaxed.

All in all 9/10

My only major complaints/problems with the game are:
 -The lack of ping lock, allowing other region players (Asia mostly) to play on NA servers and pretty much flying around on your screen making it very hard to kill
 -The lack of banning for people who team up in solo matches
 -The fact that the November update still hasn't come out... and it's December.

*Post-December Update Edit*

So, the game was FINALLY updated... we got a new season (or preseason), we got some new skins, they sorta kinda fixed the shotgun and they fixed one of the major exploits... was this patch good? No. Was it bad? No.

Daybreak has some major issues at their headquarters, they are either understaffed or just dont give a ♥♥♥♥ when it comes to this game sometimes. To their credit they did address one of the major problems, the shotgun and now its about 95% consistent, which is much better than the 50/50 you'd get pre-patch. However, there are still many exploits and bugs they haven't addressed. Daybreak I know you care about your fanbase and want to see this game do well, so for the love of god address some of these issues please!

 - Ban. Teamers. In. Solos. Add a different reporting technique for reporting teamers rather than Ctrl+R, perhaps do Ctrl+""any other letter"" if you see this player is teaming in solos... It's the most frustrating thing ever to be killed by teamers in solos, believe me.
 - The snaking/prone glitch was addressed in the most recent patch, yet people are still doing it... fix it. Don't allow for people to get into a car while prone, simple. There's no reason that you would legitimately ever need to get into a car while prone if you WEREN'T trying to preform some type of exploit.
 - Reduce the solos que time in lobbies. The wait time, once you spawned into the Fort Destiny Box used to be like 90 seconds, now it is around 150 seconds, I know we're talking about the difference of a minute but it's noticable and quite annoying, at least lower it to 120 and meet in the middle."

								I currently only have 15 hours on this game, and choose to play it casually as a nice change of pace game with friends, so keep this bias in mind as you read:

H1Z1: KOTK at its core is a a fun game--randomly parachute into a large area and find weapons, vehicles, and supplies haphazardly scattered throughout the map to survive and combat enemy players/teams. It is a very interesting concept and definitely yields some fun moments as you play the game, especially with friends. As I write I can recall a couple very cool instances, whether it be sprinting to escape the gas as it closes in the safe area, or even using the well employed VOIP to communicate with random people in the community and have some fun. Unfortunately, however, I cannot in all consciousness endorse this game, and definitely urge anyone who reads this to beware buying this.

One of its major flaws reside in the game mechanics and its consistency. Any sort of interaction with others players, including gun fights, melee fights, and even riding in vehicles with others, is awful and inconsistent. Hitboxes are horrible; theres definitely a steep learning curve to using guns, and any sort of melee combat is useless. If you so much as come within 3 feet of a wall, you will be prohibited from firing your weapon, which is especially awful in all of the close combat that exists in this game. Opening/closing doors occasionally doesn't register. Besides these coding problems, one of the biggest gameplay issues revolves around the map, which is roughly a huge 64 km^2 area. Utilization of this incredibly huge area is abysmal as safe zones are generally constricted to the same few areas in the south, and its pretty commonplace to spawn (via parachute) alongside multiple other people. This means that unique geographical features (such as the castle in the north) go unappreciated and parachuting in becomes less of a strategy and more of a race with 15 other people to a single vehicle or trailer (and thus results in massive bloodshed 10 seconds into the game in the form of one person beating everyone to an AK and racking in the multi-kills). Daybreak, the map size is awesome, spread everyone out! If I wanted to be real nitpicky I could mention the unrealistic car mechanics or rough character movement (i.e. when jumping/shooting), but at $20 and considering the numerous other issues, these small nuances can be overlooked. 

Another huge flaw in my opinion is the community. I know it's not fair to judge a game's community based on the actions of the select few, but unfortunately, finding someone yelling profanities over game chat is more consistent than even the game's mechanics. On top of this, there exists widespread cheating in solo (with individuals teaming up in a free for all) and teams (where multiple teams work together). This paired with one of the largest skill gaps on a videogame I have ever played is really frustrating. I really hate complaining about people who practice their hobby and get good at a videogame, but when one guy can 1 v 5 my team, my enjoyment suffers. Daybreak needs to introduce casual/ranked game modes, or employ some sort of ranking system where people with similar skill levels play each other. Finally, the community has communicated (in the form of spending their money) that they value aesthetics (in the form of microtransations) more than core game mechanics. Consider this for a second: a game that is in early access (and has been for almost a year) has made sure to get microtransactions working, but not even the game? I know the culture of videogames has evolved to include microtransactions, but I still believe a videogame company has an obligation to make a game that people paid for work before trying to further charge players and profit. I have unfortunately already voiced my support (by buying this game), but I know many have steered clear simply due to this fact.

A final large issue revolves around networking. If you buy this game, prepare for lag. I'm not even just talking about shots not registering (which is actually a huge issue), but full blown desynchronization from the server I have never experienced in any other game before. There are *several* instances where my friends and I have ran into this issue which include: parachuting in but being unable to move or run for the whole match; entering/exiting a vehicle but the game doesn't register, and thus you are stuck in or out on your screen but the opposite on the server; and even randomly dying out of nowhere. Paired with an already large skill gap (yes, I know, mad cuz bad), and a wait period between matches just long enough to be annoying (especially when waiting for your friends to die), and these networking issues become an unacceptable waste of my time.   

To conclude, this game has a lot of unrealized promise. Daybreak could work really hard to correct even just a few of the aforementioned things and I'd be willing to change my review to recommend it. Unfortunately, however, this company will never work to improve their game. Why would they? People continue to throw money at the devs for the little effort they have put into the game as is, just so they can have a red AR instead of black. I have nothing against companies that try to tap into its player base for a little more profit, but when that becomes its mission statement, I have issue. I have issue with that company, I have issue with the community that directly illustrates their support ($$), and I have issue with a game that uses its generic ""Early Access"" label to hide behind its problems.

TL;DR: All of the unsupported b*tching in other negative reviews have some actual truth to them."

								This game is in alpha mode for like an year now...they split the game to make more money, and still, same bugs, same gigantic queues on battle royale.

Its just disrespectful. Dont believe the "" early access""tag. Devs dont care about the game. They spent 3 months developing an ""hospital"" a building inside game, but havent take a single day to work on the ridiculous queues in battle royales. Me and 2 friends bought the game, and once we die, we have to wait 15 minutes to join a new Br.  Imagine playing like that. If this was a temporary thing i wouldnt complain, but this exists every since day 1 of h1z1.

								Great game 10/10.... until you play for a while and realize there is no incentive to keep playing. If you play solo and go at it as a lone wolf you will have a fun time and can bet on your performance to get dope prizes. The issue is when you want to play with your friends and enjoy the teamwork aspect of the game there is no incentive for performance. So even if you spend 30+ minutes and end up winning the game you recieve nothing not a crate or anything. How do you expect someone to keep playing a game with nothing to show for it? It is a very upsetting flaw and disappoints many =("

								I personally like what this game tries to achieve, but it's certainly a buyer beware situation. Watch it on Twitch before you make a decision to purchase, certainly.

You get dropped into a big map and try to be the last person alive as you run toward the extraction point. The base mechnics and functionality of H1Z1 can be described charitably as ""wonky"" and uncharitably as ""terrible."" The shooting (specifically the weird recoil and bullet drop) is very questionable and not ""smooth"" in the style Call of Duty or Battlefield games(at least modern BF games-its hit detection often reminds me of BF2).This is the least acceptable a game can function while remaining moderately competitive. It IS competitive, partially because everyone is in the same wonky boat and partially because the only thing the Devs have focused on since the game's Twitch popularity exploded is percieved balance issues and squashing hackers (the number of hackers ~1 year ago was staggering). I very much wish there was some kind of rough ""deathmatch"" game type; you will likely die in 100 Battle Royales before getting used to the gunplay.

Again:Watch on Twitch before you buy. And even if you do buy, DON'T waste your money on the ""Just Survive"" game while it remains in early access. It's a bad, uninteresting DayZ clone with less variety."

								King of the Kill ist das verbugteste Spiel was ich jemals gezockt habe. Und die Entwickler machen immer so weiter. Neues Update raushauen was wirklich immer hunderte Bugs aufweist. Egal raus damit. Sollen die Spieler sich doch mit den Bugs rumärgern. Und das ist regelmäßig so, obwohl ein Test Server existiert, wo die ganzen Bugs nach dem Testen eigentlich ausgemerzt sein sollten.

Hauptsache ist, dass es bei jedem Update eine neue Kiste gibt, die man an die Spieler verscheuern kann. Darin befindet sich allerdings nicht etwas was wertvoll sein kann, wie bei CS:GO, sondern nur irgendein Plunder, den man nichtmal mehr im Steam-Market verkaufen kann.

Das Prinzip von KOTK ist klasse, wenn da nicht diese miserablen Entwickler von Daybreak wären. Ich warte ja noch auf ein konkurrenzfähiges Spiel. Bisher sind alle anderen Battle Royale Ableger allerdings total laggy (Arma3, Ark) oder es passt irgendwas anderes nicht (The Culling -> nur schlecht umgesetzter Nahkampf).

								When H1Z1 was released the Battle Royale part of it was cool for an early access game.

Now one years later they split the game into two, still charging the same price for only one half of the game.

								Valve should add a neutral rating to their ""Do you recommend this game?"" because that's the way I feel about H1Z1: King of the Kill. I'm in between ""Recommended"" and ""Not Recommended"". I went ahead and selected ""Recommend"", but I'm still neutral.

I bought H1Z1 in Dec. 2015 and enjoyed it for 40+ hours. After the split, my hours were moved to H1Z1: Just Survive, hence why I have 49 minutes played in H1Z1: Kotk. Though, I play H1Z1 on my second account: http://steamcommunity.com/id/easyhype/.

ReviewH1Z1: King of the Kill is a decent first person/third person shooter that will make you paranoid. Before, it was called Battle Royale (sorta still is), over a hundred people participating in what you would call a loot fast, listen, shoot, kill and look all around you to survive. You can select Solo, Duo and Fives. Playing H1Z1: King of the Kill is fun with friends and sometimes even solo play. They also have a ""Pre Season"" leaderboard where you can track your solo progress (kills, score, etc).

H1Z1: Kotk has around 25k+ players at minimum playing almost constantly. I've seen as high as a 73k+ player base at times. There's no shortage of people or queue times (they recently fixed queue times which made it pretty much instant to get into a game). Starting out, you'll wait in a lobby until the timer runs out for the game to start. Once the game has started you'll begin to parachute down to a huge map from a decent height to choose a spot that might have good loot or you can hover in the air, look where everybody else is going so you can avoid them as you parachute down. Most of the time it's about getting to the ground as fast as possible to gather loot or even a vehicle to have a better start for yourself.

Yes, loot and vehicles. There's only 4 vehicles: Truck, Jeep, Police Car and ATV. Truck is the slowest of them all, but it's also better than nothing. Jeep is the second fastest whilst police car and ATV will go faster than the rest. However, ATV can only hold 2 players, has no cover and it's typically only good for gathering its biofuel and key if you have an existing vehicle. The other vehicles hold 5 players. Vehicles will allow you to move around the map faster, but they do have fuel and health.

Loot, ahh yes. There's a lot of loot. RNG depicts where loot goes. Pistols, assault rifles, grenades, molotovs, helmets, armor (makeshift/lammy) and more! Loot is always something to make everyone fight over and I've had my fair share of experience with that. You can choose to go all out and loot everything you see or gather a certain amount of items and kill other people for their items instead. Try not to loot everything you see - There's bag space. You can have an ordinary backpack that holds 1200~ weight or a military backpack that holds 2200~. Each item you loot will take up bag space. Becareful looting though, players can easily pick you off while you're looting. I've had bad experiences with that too.

I think the most lethal to you besides those pesky serial killers we call players is the toxic gas. The gas is released after the safe zone is revealed and the 5 minute timer is up. Before that you'll need to be near that safe zone circle or you're toast. The gas will get powerful as the game progresses so you'll always need to be a step ahead of it. I've even used the gas to my advantage. Know where the gas is going to spread to and if you're in the safe zone & the enemy isn't you can fire at them, drop their health and the gas will do the rest (given they are still in it). It's amusing when that happens. Although, I've had my fair share of gas deaths.

I can't really say much about their graphics in the game other than they aren't that great at max settings. My settings are on low so I can see other players better (mainly just lighting off, shadows low, other is medium to high). It's best if you tinker with your settings to find it easier to see items and players much better without much darkness.

H1Z1: King of the Kill has a crate system. The game isn't pay to win, it's just cosmetics. They even have a ""scrap"" system where you can scrap items for the scrap currency and turn scrap in for more items. Their skull system allows you to back yourself in solo play. If you do well in solo play you'll earn skulls once bet. After leveling every 5 levels you'll also receive free unlocked crates to open; otherwise, playing the game will earn you locked crates you can sell on the steam community market.

The feeling you feel when winning a game is pretty intense at times, until you realize there's no rewards for winning.

Bugs, Early Access & FrustrationsLet's not forget H1Z1: King of the Kill is still in early access and it does have a lot of issues. This is what makes me neutral about this game. They do release updates every month or so, but I feel like there's not enough hotfixes to fix common bugs or updates to the game to bring in different mechanics, items, features, etc. 

The most common bug I run into is stuck parachuting. You're hovering above the ground whilst the parachute is still intact and will force you to exit the match, but normally it ends up crashing your client instead. Second common bug is parachuting under the world, forcing you to logout and again it'll crash the client instead. Not to mention the glorious amount of loot bugs where some loot has sunk into the ground, object its on, etc.. It'll even cause the ammo to do the same depending if any objects are near, the ammo will go inside of that object and you won't be able to loot them. Let's also not forget a large amount of objects floating in midair.

I think the most frustrating part of H1Z1: King of the Kill is how static the map is and the places you never parachute down to anymore. It would make gameplay experience better if their map or map objects in general was procedurally generated. Of course loot is random based on RNG, but I feel like the map should have a significant difference almost every playthrough.

I ask myself every time I play H1Z1: Kotk, ""How come we never spawn at the Dam anymore?"". In the old map it was so fun parachuting down to the dam, gathering loot and killing people since the place is FULL of loot. Nowadays to even loot the dam you need to be lucky enough to spawn close by, get a vehicle (preferably jeep/police car/atv) and drive 3 minutes to arrive there. You'll have roughly 4 minutes to loot the richness of the Dam, but it's worth it since nobody goes there anymore..

I feel like the utilization of the map edges A-J 1-10 is horribly lacking. They only have it where people are spawned more inside of the map than on the sides.

The second most frustrating thing is, they removed the rewards for winning or coming in top 10, 20~. Back in 2015 you used to receive a loot bag that you can open. Depending on how well your position was in a game you'll get a better loot bag. But, when I came back to H1Z1 early 2016 that was removed. Winning or dying at a certain number is no longer rewarding. The only thing you have is bragging rights and that's not really incenitive to keep playing besides the Solo Season, which is 1% better than being rewarded with item(s).

There's more issues to this game that I feel could be resolved. I think there's more things Daybreak can do to H1Z1: Kotk since it does have potential. Would be nice if they introduced new weapons or new items in general, game modes, etc - That's the potential this game has, but development is quite slow and hotfixes are almost always non-existent.

OverallH1Z1: King of the Kill as I wrote is a decent game, but it's on a bad development path with redundant decision making. Now you know why I'm completely neutral about this game.

								This game is very fun when it's fun (20% of the time?)... However, the other 80% of the time, you'll want to rip your hair out, break your peripherals, and curse the developers. Vast majority of deaths are inexplicable -- for instance, you may shoot someone point blank with a shotgun only for that person to do the same to you and you are the only to die. When the death screen comes up, that person still has 70+ hp often regardless of whether or not they had armour. I could go on and on. Development is a disgrace. This game is a minimum of two years out from being a releasable game because the developers rarely update the game. When they do, they often improve one thing but degrade or break one or two other aspects. Is it worth 20 dollars? Yeah. Will you hate yourself for playing? Definitely. Note to new gamers: this game is not friendly to beginners. At all. Isn't even friendly to veterans like myself with 15+ wins."

								Steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ made by the most incompetent developer team in the world. They legitimately can´t fix ANYTHING in this game without causing something else to break. You wait a month, two for the next patch just to find out that the majority of the issues aren´t addressed, some bugs are months and months and months old. Servers are some of the worst in the industry, de-sync is at least a full second in this game and after most of your deaths you'll be left with legit question marks above your head on how did you just die?!?! Skill gap in this game is very little because of how random it is and inconsistent. You can Two tap one guy and then a minute later witness majority of your bullets do nothing to the next guy and end up dead, get a frame skip where your game legit freezes for a split second or get crazy lag/de-sync where you peak back behind the corner but the guy still gets a shot or two or ♥♥♥♥ing two taps your ♥♥♥ even though you got behind cover. Hit registration is just awful and the guns in general are inconsistant, especially shot gun. Sometimes you one shot kill someone full health 10 feet away and the next time you stick your shotgun into the guys mouth, deepthroating him to no effect, not even a gag. Basically, you're rolling a dice in every gun fight. 

TL:DR. This game is garbage and i hope DayBreak sells it to some big time Publisher that will pass it to a competent dev team to piece it together. Then i hope that the whole staff of DayBreak studios buys themselves tickets to a cruise and hits an iceberg, causing the ship to sink."

								The BR part of this game was just fine before the split. havent played the survival part since launch but they have kind of messed up the BR part after the split, long que times and less wep spawns.
Not even gonna talk about the game being the same price even though its half the game.
Shame daybreak, shame."

								I've only been playing for a couple of months but I can tell you that this game is nowhere near ready to be played on the large scale it is now. There are still a ton of issues and the development team seems to take two steps back after moving one forward with every patch or update. The problem for me was that as a new player there is absolutely no way to properly train. The practice/training mode is just plain terrible as you can never find any loot, the weapons don't re-spawn apparently. It took me almost a month to get any confidence at all in gun fights because the only way you can practice for it is to queue a game and hope you land in a populated area and fight as often as possible. The problem is that a lot of these players have been playing for so long that they've mastered two tapping or first person shotgunning. Meaning that unless you get the jump (hiding) on them you stand almost no chance.

The amount of two taps I've been getting is insane; I can't even play the ♥♥♥♥ing game anymore. Every encounter is now 5 shots or less. If you don't immediately two tap you're dead. What is the point of even looting for body armor when my last 7 or 8 deaths out of 10 are from a series of head shots in under 2 seconds. If there was a way to improve helmets to take additional shots I wouldn't be in such a rage at the moment but still...

The game also has probably the worst development team in recent memory. Every ""update"" causes more issues, the hit registration is still off and there still is some bug or glitch I encounter that ruins my game around 5-10% of the time. They are either severely understaffed or incompetent, neither bodes well for them. I'm ashamed to say I spent around $60 to get crates for new skins and that wasn't even enough to get an ultra rare item. I'm done giving my money and time. I'll patiently wait until someone else develops a similar game and play that instead. The only reason I've played as long as I have is because it's a unique and fun (when there aren't bugs/issues) but I've simply had enough."

								This game is trash.
Every single feature of it is bugged.
I don't even understand how i can even think of playing it again.

Shotgun is broken, still no fix.
Phantom bullets, still no fix.
♥♥♥♥♥♥ hitreg, still no fix.
Cars exploding randomly just in front of you, or at the begining of the game, still no fix.
HUGE lag on every servers, no one cares. (well actually, players do, Daybreak don't gives a ♥♥♥♥)
15 mins queue to get in a game, to get instantly disconnected or glitched in a car.


On the other hand, Daybreak will proudly provide every player a ♥♥♥♥ ton of skins crates to open for only 2.5€ each.


Seriously, don't buy this game, even if it's on sale."

There is litterally no lag compensation, so unless you live in places other then where the servers are located you can forget it. There is a serious need for bug reviews! the fact that i have to delete app data every time i want to launch the game, as well the fact that you tend to fall through the floor and get  no hit reg.

And for people complaining about, get better at the game. I've won many games when my shots wern't registering and if I lost I play another one. The game is a super fun game. I REALLY RECCOMEND IT."

								H1Z1 BR is a great game. When it comes to the survival mode, the map seems a little bit small for me. However, the map is great for the Battle Royale mode. The only problem with the game is the issue of players using hacks in games. I know DayBreak has been banning tons of people who hack, but the issue still remains. I still recommend this game but it may be a bit boring if you play too many games."

								This game is a disgrace to the PC community. We are now paying double for a PRE-ALPHA version of a game mode that was already included in the main game: H1Z1. This is very clearly a cash grab. When you start developing a game, you don't decide to split it up and double up costs due to your company's own lack and misuse of budget. You are punishing the players and the community for a mistake in your own development. When you create a game and promise to keep it fresh and updated at least until release you keep the game running and keep the features coming. Both of which are not happening in this case due to a shady / money hungry development team. If you promise F2P in the future for your buggy PRE-ALPHA game and decide to go back on that promise PLUS go one further and make your incoming player base pay double for the same game we had prior to this split, you don't deserve the playerbase. For all players, new and old, we now have to buy skins for both ""games"" which are basically the same game and inventory format. Comparing this to CSGO, it is like having to buy skins for each game mode they offer, Casual/Deathmatch/Competitive etc. It is honestly ridiculous. Daybreak and everyone involved with developing / publishing this game, Get your heads out of your own asses."

The bugs/lack of content is understandable, but the amount of ♥♥♥♥♥ that this company gives about there game and buyers is a big fat ♥♥♥♥ing zero. They dont seem to update this as nearly as often as they should, and when they are working on the game, it is either focused on just the battle royale portion, or figuring out a way they can ♥♥♥♥ over the people that are paying for their product by spending time they should be working on the game to come up with a plan where they split the game in two charging you more money to play both modes, and completly abandoning the whole original idea of it going FTP. 

Decent game, bad company. Until this company decides to give a ♥♥♥♥ about there game/consumers, and not just the extra pennies they can stick in their ♥♥♥ for safe keeping, I do not recommend this game."

								The game is an incredible lot of fun... If you can even get into a game. It took me 5 minutes to finally get into a game. It also crashed during the loading screen twice. Once I finally got into a game I randomly died minutes after landing by ""the environment."" Developers seem more focused on adding more bright coloured cosmetic items than fixing actual game-breaking bugs. I don't even know why I bothered buying an Early Access game.

Steam also refunded the purchase despite me having 3 hours on it, so that says a lot about the current state of the game."

								Defeat your enemies with a variety of Weapons, such as lag spikes, glitchy car physics, Inaccurate reticles, amazingly innaccurate shotgun hit registration, frame drops while shooting and random ping interruptions locking your weapons..
It is in early access but a game can only be so faulty untill something has to give..

Untill i can i can play this game prpoerly without being disconnected or dying from a range of bullsh*t reasons. i wont be giving this game any more of my time. This game can stil have a good future, all the devs need to do is listen to dr.disrespect! (Slick Daddy Club ftw)
The concept of the game itself is so unique, and the reason so many people play this is becuase there arent many alternatives. Lets hope that the market can get crammed with these battle-royale style titles and then find out who is left at the top...
Thankfully PUBG will be able to become to top BR game. So im very excited for that.
Survivalists: Play DayZ or Arma 3: Edict for hardcore survival experiences.
Battle Royale Lovers: Player Unknown's Battlegrounds :D or Arma 3 Battle Royale.
I would write an extended review, but it really isnt worth my time at its current state.
If you dont think this game is worth a try, then Definetely dont get Just survive. its a watered down unsupported surivial version of this game. guess which one the devs are updating more..
Now if youll excuse me im going to wait for this game to be done. and grow a very long beard at the same time.

								It really is not worth the money at this point but is still a ton of fun. 

Its fun and addictive until you start questioning things, then it becomes monotonous, tedius and just plain rage inducing.
These 'things' include, but are not limited to, hackers, lack of content, bullets not registering, sniper shotguns and more hackers. Yeah this game really could do without the hackers! 

Either way it is good fun and I'm having a blast, just don't question things and you'll love it. (IMHO though, it probably isn't worth your money in this current state)."

								I personally like what this game tries to achieve, but it's certainly a buyer beware situation. Watch it on Twitch before you make a decision to purchase, certainly.

You get dropped into a big map and try to be the last person alive as you run toward the extraction point. The base mechnics and functionality of H1Z1 can be described charitably as ""wonky"" and uncharitably as ""terrible."" The shooting (specifically the weird recoil and bullet drop) is very questionable and not ""smooth"" in the style Call of Duty or Battlefield games(at least modern BF games-its hit detection often reminds me of BF2).This is the least acceptable a game can function while remaining moderately competitive. It IS competitive, partially because everyone is in the same wonky boat and partially because the only thing the Devs have focused on since the game's Twitch popularity exploded is percieved balance issues and squashing hackers (the number of hackers ~1 year ago was staggering). I very much wish there was some kind of rough ""deathmatch"" game type; you will likely die in 100 Battle Royales before getting used to the gunplay.

Again:Watch on Twitch before you buy. And even if you do buy, DON'T waste your money on the ""Just Survive"" game while it remains in early access. It's a bad, uninteresting DayZ clone with less variety."

But sadly it's no where near a complete product with many bugs in the game for the years it's had in early access. 

I would wait for unknown players battle grounds before picking it up

								This game has potential, it has had potential for the entire 18 months it has been in early access. It's a shame then that the absolute pirates at Daybreak Game Company cannot work through the issues this game has. Updates to the game mechanics and interface have been consistently laced with flaws and are mainly there to placate the player base and allow Daybreak to sell more crates and keys. You would think with over 1 million early access sales and their ever consistent crate updates that Daybreak might be able to employ some competent developers."

								HOW TO BECOME A HATED GAME DEV

Step 1. Announce you are making a game that will be free!
Step 2. Release it as early access with tons of bugs for $20
Step 3. Release a new game mode to hold people over while you fix the bugs in the actual game
Step 4. Announce the game will NOT be free 
Step 5. Split the main game and the secondary game mode into 2 seperate games and charge $20 for each!
Step 6. WELL DONE YOU'RE NOW HATED
Step 7 never buy another one of there games again
Step 8 gg daybreak you fgts"

								I got to top 8 today and I was pretty confident about winning the whole match. Then the game suddenly decided to lock my weapon just before an easy kill, even though I had no problems with my connection at all. 0/5. I'd never recommend anyone a game that has as many bugs as this one even if it had potential, or even if I still play it almost daily. I'm going to update my review if they ever decide to fix the game, and I think it's pretty ridiculous that it's still so buggy even after all the time Daybreak's had to develop the game."

								Game has A LOT of problems. View distance on 3rd and 1st person is literaly broken. Bullet drop is incredibly miscoded/broken. There are servers in North America, but West only. There's a lot of lags and misconception.

Good game concept, but this game is still the story of Early Access game that will give them money in the end and you will never have a good service as much as the price you pay for it. 

My personnal opinion: Don't buy until full release. Do not encourage Early Access games such as this one."

								Before you start saying ""It's Early Access bro, 420 blaze it, china #1, SAMMIT"" that I know most people that play this game would say... This game is buggy, and it gets worse and worse.  Today I died by a vehicle in 1-man BR while I was parachuting in. I spawned in and fell to my death way up in the sky.  Another time I was standing in a kitchen tearing up clothes to make bandages, and I died.  The kill message said ""better luck next time"", normally it says who killed you and how much life they had.  I have died 3 out of 5 times due to bugs, and in Just Survive people can glitch invisible.  

Now before you say ""it's in Alpha"", this is where i say, I'm trying to prevent people from wasting their money on an unfinished game.  Wait until it is finished or comes out to beta, in probably 37 years.  There are plenty of other alternative games that are less buggy that you can play for a few years before this one is ready. 



 Do your research before buying a game!!"

								Okay so let me just start off by saying just don't buy this game. Biggest waste of 20 bucks there is. Bought this game a long time ago before the two h1z1's separated and you know I played from time to time. And so the separation came and I forgot my password like some of us do as well right? Yeah so I feel like playing this game for the first time in a month but I'm locked out of my account. All cool I try to reset my password but in order to do this I need to provide a secret question that I CANT RECALL MAKING. So I decided to write to the support of H1Z1 in order to get my account back and so I see some pages that they have on getting your account back and stuff and I see :

Real name:
Daybreak Username:
Name on Credit Card:
The last 4 digits of the Credit Card used on the account:
Current answer to your Security Question:

And thats the information I cant provide since I don't know the answer to my secret question but Hey theres another option -

If you do not have all of the above information, please prepare as much of the following information as you can:

The full billing address:
E-mail address:
 
And I'm like alright let me do that then and so I do then I wait 2 days for a response which is pretty ridicolous. Okay all good they reply but their response is that I need to provide the answer to my security question before we keep going with the recovery of the account which as I already said I didn't make therefore I don't know the answer to. And I say so in the reply but they keep on insisting on the security question which I don't know and the guy said that if I don't answer he will close the support ticket and so he did. Overall decent game, terrible fu*king support not worth it once you lose your account it's gone cause the people that are suppoused to help don't do anything to help :)"

I LOVE survival games and everytime i play it has my heart racing. I am giving a legitament review and not complaining that they split 2 games.  The game all in all is great, The idea of it, the skill you need, and you dont need a friend to play it for it to be fun. I highly recommend if you love survival and if you are willing to look past it's problems because it's not the only game with problems."

								I currently only have 15 hours on this game, and choose to play it casually as a nice change of pace game with friends, so keep this bias in mind as you read:

H1Z1: KOTK at its core is a a fun game--randomly parachute into a large area and find weapons, vehicles, and supplies haphazardly scattered throughout the map to survive and combat enemy players/teams. It is a very interesting concept and definitely yields some fun moments as you play the game, especially with friends. As I write I can recall a couple very cool instances, whether it be sprinting to escape the gas as it closes in the safe area, or even using the well employed VOIP to communicate with random people in the community and have some fun. Unfortunately, however, I cannot in all consciousness endorse this game, and definitely urge anyone who reads this to beware buying this.

One of its major flaws reside in the game mechanics and its consistency. Any sort of interaction with others players, including gun fights, melee fights, and even riding in vehicles with others, is awful and inconsistent. Hitboxes are horrible; theres definitely a steep learning curve to using guns, and any sort of melee combat is useless. If you so much as come within 3 feet of a wall, you will be prohibited from firing your weapon, which is especially awful in all of the close combat that exists in this game. Opening/closing doors occasionally doesn't register. Besides these coding problems, one of the biggest gameplay issues revolves around the map, which is roughly a huge 64 km^2 area. Utilization of this incredibly huge area is abysmal as safe zones are generally constricted to the same few areas in the south, and its pretty commonplace to spawn (via parachute) alongside multiple other people. This means that unique geographical features (such as the castle in the north) go unappreciated and parachuting in becomes less of a strategy and more of a race with 15 other people to a single vehicle or trailer (and thus results in massive bloodshed 10 seconds into the game in the form of one person beating everyone to an AK and racking in the multi-kills). Daybreak, the map size is awesome, spread everyone out! If I wanted to be real nitpicky I could mention the unrealistic car mechanics or rough character movement (i.e. when jumping/shooting), but at $20 and considering the numerous other issues, these small nuances can be overlooked. 

Another huge flaw in my opinion is the community. I know it's not fair to judge a game's community based on the actions of the select few, but unfortunately, finding someone yelling profanities over game chat is more consistent than even the game's mechanics. On top of this, there exists widespread cheating in solo (with individuals teaming up in a free for all) and teams (where multiple teams work together). This paired with one of the largest skill gaps on a videogame I have ever played is really frustrating. I really hate complaining about people who practice their hobby and get good at a videogame, but when one guy can 1 v 5 my team, my enjoyment suffers. Daybreak needs to introduce casual/ranked game modes, or employ some sort of ranking system where people with similar skill levels play each other. Finally, the community has communicated (in the form of spending their money) that they value aesthetics (in the form of microtransations) more than core game mechanics. Consider this for a second: a game that is in early access (and has been for almost a year) has made sure to get microtransactions working, but not even the game? I know the culture of videogames has evolved to include microtransactions, but I still believe a videogame company has an obligation to make a game that people paid for work before trying to further charge players and profit. I have unfortunately already voiced my support (by buying this game), but I know many have steered clear simply due to this fact.

A final large issue revolves around networking. If you buy this game, prepare for lag. I'm not even just talking about shots not registering (which is actually a huge issue), but full blown desynchronization from the server I have never experienced in any other game before. There are *several* instances where my friends and I have ran into this issue which include: parachuting in but being unable to move or run for the whole match; entering/exiting a vehicle but the game doesn't register, and thus you are stuck in or out on your screen but the opposite on the server; and even randomly dying out of nowhere. Paired with an already large skill gap (yes, I know, mad cuz bad), and a wait period between matches just long enough to be annoying (especially when waiting for your friends to die), and these networking issues become an unacceptable waste of my time.   

To conclude, this game has a lot of unrealized promise. Daybreak could work really hard to correct even just a few of the aforementioned things and I'd be willing to change my review to recommend it. Unfortunately, however, this company will never work to improve their game. Why would they? People continue to throw money at the devs for the little effort they have put into the game as is, just so they can have a red AR instead of black. I have nothing against companies that try to tap into its player base for a little more profit, but when that becomes its mission statement, I have issue. I have issue with that company, I have issue with the community that directly illustrates their support ($$), and I have issue with a game that uses its generic ""Early Access"" label to hide behind its problems.

TL;DR: All of the unsupported b*tching in other negative reviews have some actual truth to them."

								I gave it a chance. I've been playing since day ♥♥♥♥ing one, before the split, before the crates, before the lizard squad DDOS'ing, before the firing of John Smedley. This being said, don't let my few hours fool you, I have over 800 hours in both gamemodes, before the split. This, along with H1Z1:JS, was good. It WAS good. But not anymore. Not at all. This pathetic excuse of a game has had ZERO progression since day one. More crates, more money. That's all they care about. The only major changes for this game has been a couple lighting changes, a couple new zombie/player models, and a couple new items. Other than that? Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing nothing. Not a single thing. Don't buy this garbage, don't buy their crates, don't support these jackasses that care about nothing other than more money. Please."

								are your devs 12 years old? I mean really how do you make such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game?
 the concept is brilliant but the development is crap.  I have to alt tab out and kill the process half the time just to exit the game.  my mouse cursor dissappears so once again i have to kill the process.  game crashes for no reason.  these are things i would think you would address at the beginning not half way throught development."

								This game went to sh*t when SOE/Daybreak Game Company was purchased by an investment company.  The focus changed from game development to releasing the next monetizable feature.  Now H1Z1 is two separate $20 games... and the games will still have micro transactions!

I feel sorry for the development team; I believe that they are really trying to release a decent product.  That's not what Daybreak cares about though.


STOP BUYING EARLY ACCESS GAMES!"

								Edit: Apparently when I posted this review, they just added the servers back. Needless to say, Australian servers are back, and they are working well!

Please Rep This So People Can See! There are Australian servers on H1Z1!! The people that are saying there is no Aus servers don't look around enough. Down in the Settings you can swap regions to Australia and play on there, the Aussie servers are alive with people too!"

								DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME!

The cash grabbers dared to split up a game into two. They charge you 20 bucks for this piece of work, average waiting time on servers to play on is 5+ minutes. 

The game has been out for over a year now. What have they produced? Less than even the DayZ SA devs in that same amount of time, which is rather sad considering they have to compensate for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ engine. A couple of pistols and a few rifles? 3 whole cars to choose from? Great. 

If you're asking yourself why I have this, I bought the game on release last year, thinking it might be worthwile. To be honest, there hasn't been a zombie survival game actually worth playing the last couple of years.

If you want to play BR, go play it on ArmA 3, where it's supposed to be played. Hell, even CS:GO's Hunger Games are more fun than this monstrosity.

								If this game played like the preview i would have payed $60, but this was always supposed to be a completely free game with optional cosmetic microtransactions. The only reason it is still preorder is because they promised free on release. This game could be so much better, like in the trailer, if you could charge a guy with an axe and have a chance against a gun. I think a machete or axe takes less than 20 hits to kill someone. That should be the risk and reward charging a gun. Right now its all open areas dominated by shotguns and rifles (too common). They should make areas as if they are making a map for any other pvp game, or at least take out the endless forests you spend forever running through only to get killed and respawn right back in the middle.

Right now the game looks like it could be great but these morons cant seem to stop focusing on making us buy skins. There seems to be no hope for this game at all."

								I probably have about 250+ hours in the original H1Z1. Mostly BR but some survival as well. This game is garbage. Hot steaming garbage. The bugs and blatant balancing issues that have been in this game since launch are still here and probably won't change. They cut the already ♥♥♥♥ content in half and have the balls to ask for more money for BOTH games. I've given it time and yet nothing changes. Hey, do you want to float in the air in the start of a BR for 45 seconds? Only to land to be gunned down by someone with loot already? Good! Now enjoy queueing again. Want to get shot through walls because the netcode is so ♥♥♥♥ that your movement means nothing? Want someone to drive at you in a vehicle going 90 mph only to jump out 5 feet from you and have their model lag behind so you can't remotely get a shot? Want to get gang ♥♥♥♥ed in solo BR? Want to spawn in random forests with one ♥♥♥♥ing building so you can spend 20 minutes walking to the safe zone, just to get slaughtered by someone who actually got loot? The list goes on. Don't worry though, those will never get fixed, but hey, at least they can add more crates!!!! These devs want money, nothing more, nothing less. Until they get their heads on straight, this game will always be a terribly optimized, buggy, unbalanced, turd."

 nice idea, bad developer. 
As I started playing this game, it was a combination of ""Just Survive"" and ""King of the Kill"". They have splitted it now, but I can´t see any changes. The atmosphere is just super awesome in this game. You get really nervous when you are plundering a gas station and someone parks his car outside the house and you here steps coming.
Coming to the bis Minus of this game:
The gameplay and controls of this game are horrible. The standards are ok so I gave it 5 / 10 but in combat you feel like you have never touched a keyboard and mouse, and the game is pretty new.

I really enjoy the Battle Royal - Mode, but when it comes to a fight, the game ruines his own potential"

								It really is not worth the money at this point but is still a ton of fun. 

Its fun and addictive until you start questioning things, then it becomes monotonous, tedius and just plain rage inducing.
These 'things' include, but are not limited to, hackers, lack of content, bullets not registering, sniper shotguns and more hackers. Yeah this game really could do without the hackers! 

Either way it is good fun and I'm having a blast, just don't question things and you'll love it. (IMHO though, it probably isn't worth your money in this current state)."

								I've deleted my previous review and decided to write a new one!

They're liars, money diggers, incompetent, and almost completely unprofessional however they have turned the game into something much better, the graphics are beautiful now and I can hardly notice any hackers around anymore.

Here are the things you need to consider before buying this game though:

1- You'll need a really good graphics card because the map isn't optimised and the fps will be low as ♥♥♥♥ so make sure you have a $100~$150 VGA Card at least (Like a GTX 950 or something and don't expect 60 fps), not because of the gaming experience and that ♥♥♥♥, it's just because if you play it on less than 70% render quality and low resolution you won't be able to see the difference between a player and a tree branch and you'll just keep dying without knowing who the f**k is shooting you and from where.

2- You need friends to play this game otherwise your teammates will kill you or you'll get bored quick.

3- Buy it on sale because it's not worth $20, unless you don't really care and want it bad.

4- No matter how far we go, the game will always be glitchy as f**k and with every update they fix a few bugs and add a few more.

5- Basically, don't expect that you'll be able to just launch the game and have a lot of fun at any time because no matter how good things are going, they always manage to f**k it up somehow!

Buy the game ONLY if you have no problem with the things I've written above, especially #1!"

								I cant really tell you what the big hype for this game is. I think the big thing that gets me is the constant bugs. Bugs from getting stuck on the ground when landing, going underneath the map, getting stuck in the cars, and fences.The game is great if you take away from the bugs but it does need a lot of work.The biggiest problem i have is a2 shotgun rounds point blank in the head doesnt kill someone with no helmet, but an ar15 going after someone with a helmet can kill me with 4shots with full health. The game logic doesnt add up and from playing this game last year to now, this was still a major problem they had. After a year of this being a standalone, i really cant see the big issues being fixed. But besides the bugs the combat is really fun when the bugs arnt happeming. You will always be surrounded by people keeping your guard up most of the time.

Pros
Driver cars
Lots of ppl to fight off
Gotta lead your shots
Plenty of guns
random bombs will drop on you
Lots of buildings to enter

Cons
The gas moves to slow needs to be sped up
Bugs ruin the game
couple of cheaters (every online game has em)
Shotguns dont work most of the time"

								Thought id give this game another try. Was fun playing King of The Kill for awhile... Then I decided instead fo doing normal BRs how about I try zombie BR. Doing really well, get a jeep get fully geared up, I get up the mountain after outrunning another jeep trying to kill me.. Only to get shot through the wall by a hacker. Its been over a year longer than that and these guys still ahve not got their ♥♥♥♥ together. THE GAME IS FULL OF HACKERS! Why play a survival game thats full of hackers, their are many games out there that are successful at getting these people out so I know its not impossible.. But you guys are pathetic glad I never wasted a cent buying your stupid skins ethier. Go ahead get the top ten in a BR, how about even 2nd or 1st place... Guess what? You ge the same stupid ♥♥♥♥ing shirt over and over... This game is done, im gonna let it burn and im not supporting anything this company puts out anymore! BEWARE HACKERS EVERYWHERE EVEN IN THE BATTLE ROYAL SERVERS!"

								Playing this game is like trying to eat a 5 star meal on cardboard funiture with a lava pit below you. Alright, the concept is great, having the safe zone that shrinks, the parachuting at the beggining, the team selections, ect. The problem? this game probably has the least experienced devs in the world, or atleast the laziest, maybe ♥♥♥♥♥iest. The most recent bug patch they put out literally fixed 0 bugs. 

Bugs they said they fixed:
Spam crouching - Still a thing
Glitched reloads - Worse now then before
Cars turbo being stuck - Still broken
Cars driving off when you get out - Still happens

List of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ features and glitches no one is going to fix:
Shotgun - You Might as well use a dull knife (sometimes does damage, sometimes not)
Lamps - Will blow your car up in miliseconds
Cars Exploding randomly - Ever touch the bottom of your car with a wierd object? Did it explode? It will in this game.
Parachutes - Who knows, maybe you will fall through the ground, maybe you will die when you hit the ground, maybe you will spawn without one, maybe it will depsawn when you're half-way to the ground.

Hit registration.... No words, it feels like bullets have a randomly generated percent chance to do damage. You just never know. ♥♥♥♥ this game, ♥♥♥♥ the devs, and ♥♥♥♥ the community too."

								In it's current state KotK is one of the most buggy and broken shooters you'll find. With poor optimisation and a company driven by nothing more than money with no regard to it's player base, Daybreak is really pushing the limits. 

On the other hand, the game concept is something you won't find elsewhere in this style and it has a lot of potential. Once you're actually able to join a game you'll see that graphically, it looks fairly nice (with the odd few clipping errors here and there). Gameplay wise the game is very balanced too, in which respect a new player is able to join with absolutely no disadvantages or advantages other than personal experience. Although money hungry, all microtransactions are thankfuly kept cosmetic. 

You'll compete to be the last man (or team) standing in games of up to 200 odd people at peak times. Winning won't come easy and you'll likely be faced with tens or even hundreds of loses before you reach that end goal. With enough practice and determination you'll get there, and it will feel great.

There is a fairly large learning curve which may take a while to get the hang of but if you're willing to put in the time and practice, it will prove rewarding. Along with that, the community isn't so bad either, you'll meet some nice people and have hillarious encounters although as with any game there is a fair bit of toxicity. Of course if it's not for you, you can always toggle voice chat & stick with friends in teams of up to five. 

You'll spend countless hours in this game having your patience tested while you wait in a thousand player queue and if you have a short temper you'll easily rage at the poor servers & game breaking glitches/bugs cutting your game short that you'll certainly come across. Along with that, idealistically, you wan't a better PC than the recommended on Steam due to it being so intensive.

However, overall the game is something painfully amazing. If you're someone who is willing to look past the bugs every so often and if you enjoy competitive & 'tryhard' player vs player action, then this is certainly a game for you."

								In it's current state The game has several bugs and problems that were never fixed from it's Alpha/Beta phase. The game still feels Like it's in alpha. This is before considering the problem it had yesterday with server overload which should have been expected but wasnt. 

My problems so far:
Game randomly lags despite having a computer that can run it no problem
Random disconnections
Inconsistant frames 
Textures not loading
Not being able to leave game normally and having to force close.

there's probably more problems but I've just listed the ones on the top of my head.
I honestly feel like the game ran better before it became a ""full release"" or whatever you wanna call this.
I hope the devs fix their game. I'm kind of glad i didnt pay full price for this and got it back when H1Z1 was a single game with 2 modes"

								I loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of this buggy ♥♥♥ game when they had the original map and it was in early access. They single handedly ♥♥♥♥ing destroyed this game with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing graphics change that was unnecessary, and somehow made it buggier than before and ruined every aspect of the game players loved in the early access. Change when it wasn't even necessary. ♥♥♥♥ this broken ♥♥♥♥ game. Looks like a ♥♥♥♥ing mobile game now, good work daybreak."

The game isn't that bad when it comes to actually playing the game but it's not worth the wait. 10/10 best waiting simulator! Not to mention the amount of bugs for a game that's been out for quite a while now, kind of pathetic if you ask me."

								game is awesome, a lil buggy but they do their best for the money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥s they are, as for the hackers ♥♥♥♥ i dont get people complaining ive run into about a couple dozen MAX in over 2000hrs...love the randomness and how every gunfight can be unique in a certain way or another, only thing i hate they did was take the jumpshotting out, there isnt much movement already for gun fights so that i feel could have stayed in, either way the game is coming into its own and within another year should be fully polished. 9.7/10 (as i have patience and realize things dont happen over night, yea they ♥♥♥♥ up with patches every now and again but exclude all that and just look at the game 9.7/10 easy)"

								Its pathetic. You would think that after they made it into two games they would make it better. Before if i queued for a 2 person ""king of the kill"" i would get in instantly. Now its expecting me to wait 15 minutes for that. Or 3 minutes just for a solo queue. Thats dumb. They made the game worse. As of 2/19/2016 dont get this game. Very dumb. 
They should make more servers so you can get in faster.

								Don't support these devs. Game is not 'early access,' as they say. It's a full release and includes crates, microtransactions and they split the game to make more money. Battle royale is decent but not worth paying for if you have Rust, Arma 3, etc...

Was really greedy of them to make skins not marketable. Forces you to open crates to get skins instead of getting them free.

								I had +220 hours on H1Z1 before it was split. 

I will tell you what: The concept of BR was good. It was quick, full of people, very competitive, always gave you that rush. It was good for alpha, but then you started to notice something. 
- The map sucks. Its like if you had spent 2 hours on far cry 2 editor. No details at all. Same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vegetation brush everywhere. 
- 3 main weapons: shotgun, ar15 and ak47. So poor.
- Queues to play. Such long queues. Was it that expensive to buy more servers? Oh wait...thats what the next point kicks right in.
- Developers only care about money. For real. Updates only had small fixes like ""ak now is a bit less powerful"" or ""car speed reduced"" and all the rest was about 100 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ skins for which you have to buy keys and crates. Its such a rip off. Its an alpha game, for ♥♥♥♥s sake, and they charge you like millions for skins. Winning battle royale only gives you horrible loot which is absolutely worthless, because, of course, they do not want you to get cool content by winning and proving yourself to be good, no, they want you to spend more moneyz in their alpha game which will never be completed except for the fantastic crate&key system. They even have their in-game money. Why? So they can control the price of keys. It would be fatal for them if people could sell keys or crates.
Its so disgusting to see that as soon as they get some fame, they instantly forget about the game and start looking for all kinds of ideas to rip you off. It bothered me so hard that my ingame name in DayZ SA is ""H1Z1Sucks"".
Seriously, only buy this game if all you care is about BUYING content that otherwise you would get for free. In addition (but last) their ♥♥♥♥in brilliant bussinessmen came up with the idea of splitting the game in two, so that instead of having one alpha game with two game modes, they had 2 broken alpha games for each 20€. And the worst is, they tried to make us believe it was because ""they wanted to focus more"". 

Oh, and as I write I remember another thing, the ""Green Battle royal"" or whatever it was called. They realised people only played for the BR mode, so they thought ""Hey, could we charge them for playing BR mode? Oh yea we can, but lets disguise it as a new mode with extra luxury weapon skins"". Then you win the br green and you check your AR15 skin and realise they only put 30 seconds in sprayin some green ♥♥♥♥♥♥ brush over the model. ♥♥♥♥in brilliant."

								Look, honestly this game is fun, but man it's buggy as hell. The best part of this game is playing with friends and when you get into groups of 5, you'll often find that 1 of you crashes upon starting up. This game has been out for a long time and they still haven't fixed it. There are plenty of other bugs too. A lot of the time my game will even crash while starting up.

But the real reason I'm writing this review is because they saw that their game became successful and decided to split it into 2 games charging the original $20 for each game totalling $40 now. HELL NO! WTH! You can't just up the price of a game like that! It's been out for at least a year and now you are doubling the price. Are you serious?! This was supposed to be a F2P game upon release and usually the longer games are out the less they cost, but you are one of the few companies to go the other way. Way to trash your companies name for some extra dough, which probably isn't even going to be that much. And the worst part is, your game is still just about as glitchy as when you started."

								Almost every bad review is done by someone with less than 100 hours in the game lol.



""THE GAME IS UNOPTIMIZED AND RUNS HORRIBLE. IT CRASHES ALOT AND IT LAGS EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE ♥♥♥♥!""
said the guy with the $300 dell laptop

The game runs fine if you actually put some money into building a semi decent pc. The game also looks good if you're able to turn up the graphics.

As for the cheaters, I am constantly seeing cheaters get banned. 

""The devs don't work on the game at all!""
Ignition?
Skirmish?
Weapon updates?


Long story short the game is good if you have a decent pc."

								Literally the worst game devs of any video game ever. Instead of working on the game breaking bugs and glitches, all they care about is cash cow-ing their broken game with in-game apparel and streamer-focused events. I've had this game long before it split into two (which by the was was the ♥♥♥♥♥iest decision anyone could have ever made for any video game) and somehow the game has gotten worse since then."

								H1z1 King of the kill is great game with funny idea. Playing with friends is fun and even solo can be enjoyable.
Kotk is in early acces so when you buy the game you must be aware that it is not complete and has multiple annoying bugs (or funny ones) I personaly got killed by a door at start of duo game. 
If you like hunger games and run and shoot kind of games you should enjoy this one.

								Lets start from the beginning.
Before the game split at Z1 it was amazing.The game felt amazing and i played it so much everyday.Nothing was more fun than this game.Fights were longer and better and in general the game was more fun.When the game split the game started getting some updates which i had nothing against until that day when they announced Z2.I tought it will be alright but then we got this.
We got a unoptimized map with tons of useless props n ♥♥♥♥.The combat became really poor.People who have way less skill are able to 2tap you because 2tapping is all about luck.People with computers that run this game on 300 fps have a bigger advantage and will ♥♥♥♥ on you 90% of the time.Hipfire is completely broken and so is the shotgun.Every fight people will go and hide behind rocks where you cant even see their bodys or heads and you will start getting shot from nowhere.People who are betting are sitting on the edge and people who look for kills wait for that 1 fight and then come behind you and ♥♥♥♥ you.The combat changed to much and the game is not what it used to be.The devs are working on skins and not on the game which is even more sad,every patch they ruin something and i have no idea how.I still play it and will play it but i really think a game with such potential shouldnt be falling like this and it makes me sad that after almost 800 hours of playing this game having amazing fights and wins the game keeps going downhill and not up.And this twitch ♥♥♥♥ is getting out of hand.FIX THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME AND STOP MAKING SKINS."

								Lets see here, if you were to ask me if I think that you should buy this game I'd put it quite simply like this. If you are looking for an experience in which not what you see is what you get, then you need to look no further than this specimen we see here that acummulates all of the negative aspects a game should not hold over time based on the lack of leadership and moderation in itself, with these values it also embodies what we all hate, faggarinos, and that is quite literally the largest problem that is visible throughout the community itself, which correlates to the high level of dissatisfaction that everyone, including leprechauns, has to deal with on a mental and metaphysical level every single second this atrocious lump of mucus is alive.

EDIT: More updates comes more trash. Once again it is not worth the filth it was built on.

EDIT: Biggest failure.

								Its a great game to be honest. Haven't really met any hackers, I've seen multiple people get banned (there is a small notofication in the middle of then screen if someone gets banned). The updates actually makes a difference, some good some bad. And we have a new map coming out soon. I hope..

That being said I can understand why some people got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of when they split the game in two. But so far if you asked me, it has been a good thing. Atleast for KoTK. Can speak for the other one because I don't play it."

DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

You will be greatly disappointed by the developer of this game (Daybreak)
They always manage to mess up something every single patch and never listen to the community.
It's obvious that they are here to make as much money as they can and just abandon the game."

								Trust the bad reviews. 


I had several hundred hours before they ""split"" the game (effectivly lowering productivity by 50% and breaking several parts of the game) because i hoped and prayed that semi-frequent updates were a good sign. They wernt.

Between the cheaters, glitches and all around incompletness of the game after....however many years now, i can not recommend anyone to play this game. Rather than fixing these issues, they release more microtransactions. Another example of incompetancy was when they finally claimed to fix 1 pre-game bug that was a little annoying (exploding car/tombstone); then before even releasing said update, decide to do away with the whole lobby system instead for apperantly having some massive internal revelation of a better way to have a pregame lobby.

 If you dont see why this is an issue, then youre probably dumb enough to play this game. This game is spinning its wheels and going absolutely nowhere. They still have the same handful of items since launch (their wiki lies and says 660, but they include airdrop tickets, emotes, and shl tty variations of the same item; like backpacks). 

And the worst thing? China has got their hands on it, which is the coalmine canary of video games. Anyone over the age of 15 knows that once the chineese start playing a game enmasse, its days are numbered.

The company is run by morons and my harddrive feels lighter for doing away with it."

								(My playtime is very low as its the first time playing since the H1Z1 game split)

I really don't know where to start.. I tried to play for just over an hour, about 15 minutes was actual game play. The game constantly gets stuck on loading screens (entering the game or loading the lobby) and only took me back to menu once after a game, the rest of the time it crashed.

Graphically the newer map does look better but its still nothing amazing and the sounds are mediocre at best.

As for the gameplay, its exactly how I remember it being before the split; Awful. I drove my car at full speed right through a player and he got away without a scratch... Then later on while being chased full speed by a police car, the passenger jumps out (still at full speed) and instantly 1 shot kills me while I'm still driving.

If you want a very arcadey/broken game, buy this. But be warned, you'll want to smash something out of frustration!
Save your money for when PlayerUnknowns BattleGrounds comes out, that game is legit!"

								Do not purchase this game.  Do not support unethical price gouging.
The developer has a long history of releasing buggy, unoptimized, and overall terrible games ripe with microtransactions, and this one is no different.  They LIED about it going free to play, and then split their game in half, doubling the total price before it's even out of Alpha. This is not okay! 

This change is nothing but a dirty cash grab.  Daybreak as a company has a track record of failure and will do anything to try to get out of the red, and this is a prime example.

They haven't released a quality game in over 15 years.  With all due respect to their employees and their livelihoods, this company should have been abolished years ago.  It has been driven into the ground repeatedly by poor management, and compounded by lousy investments from both Sony and Columbus Nova.  

No one talks about it, but there is no guarantee this game will even be available to play in months, let alone years. In 2014 Daybreak (then SOE) reportedly lost Sony $60 million, and now just one year after being sold off, this is the kind of gouging they're trying to pull on customers.  Not enough red flags for you? They've had multiple huge layoffs over the years,  at times completely devestating their customer support and quality assurance teams.

If your battle royale itch needs scratching, I'd recommend Rust or ARK. Both games have survival and BR modes, both are backed by more committed developers that aren't just there to separate your money from your wallet."

								H1Z1 was launched as an Early Access title priced @ $20 and the announced business model was ""Free to play"".  At the start of the month (Feb. 2016) they gave notice that come February 17 2016, they`ll scrape the free to play model and split the game into two titles, as follows:


- H1Z1: Just Survive @ $19.99 (your standard multiplayer survival) 

- H1Z1: King of the Kill @ $19.99 (""competitive"" game modes like Battle Royale)


New players, avoid this, you`re esentially paying double for the same content we already have and they`re not even out yet, who knows how many business model changes this will undergo. Great game or not, vote with your wallet and do not support unethical business practices. Bleh."

								Queue waiting simulator 2016. Queue estimated wait time is 8 min but instead i had to wait 30 min and after 30 min it says 4 min wait time. Daybreak said they would improve gameplay experience. They promise but dont deliver. when they divided H1Z1 into 2 seperate game modes. They make you pay $20 each which makes no sense as in why they're so money hungry. They couldve simply kept it the way it is and improved on it. But instead they leave a under developed game and seperate it into 2 seperate games in order to Make it ""better"" for players. That was a poor decision daybreak. I would rather have the old H1Z1 that was already bad instead of having this 2 $20 games that shouldve only been $20 for both experiences of survival and battle royale. Dont buy this game unless it goes back to the wait it used to be.... the better version. Very disappointed. (And whats King of the Kill? rip of off the name king of the hill)"

								My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him. ""if you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate. you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exacly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me - ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through"". I agreed. At 27, i have never touched a cigarette. I must say. I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."

								This game is in alpha mode for like an year now...they split the game to make more money, and still, same bugs, same gigantic queues on battle royale.

Its just disrespectful. Dont believe the "" early access""tag. Devs dont care about the game. They spent 3 months developing an ""hospital"" a building inside game, but havent take a single day to work on the ridiculous queues in battle royales. Me and 2 friends bought the game, and once we die, we have to wait 15 minutes to join a new Br.  Imagine playing like that. If this was a temporary thing i wouldnt complain, but this exists every since day 1 of h1z1.

								I dont usualy write negative reviews, but this game and it's technical page (if that's the right expression) is absolutely garbage.

Don't get me wrong the gameplay and mechanism is all really decent. Its fun to play with friends, even solo. But when it comes to technical things I'm about to lose control and hit something.

Talking about optimization in this game is probably main stream and I don't fully mind having 45-60 fps. but when I can't even alt+tab. Not even accidentally because then it ♥♥♥♥s up so hard that I have to force the shut down of the PC then is something wrong. And it's not even alt+tab, I can't even exit the game the way it's supposed to be exited. Cuz of black screen again and yea next shut down approaching. have to exit the game through task manager, and its like 75% change. On 25%  it won't let me so, forced shut down or try to sleep my PC which is like 50% chance aswell.

Actually I could talk ♥♥♥♥ about this game all day long, but I feel like there is no purpose, people won't even read this or just leave negative thumb because they are the ones that like the game and they don't want to see negative reviews. 
So I'll end it here with words. That the gameplay is kinda good, if u have really good PC u probably can maxed out the ♥♥♥♥ out of it and have good fps and probably u won't experience things I do.  But I hope it gets better for people with normal PC's.

Didn't want to write this but after last playing I just had to. it was too much for me.

Sorry for my englando and have a nice day lads, you will do better if you buy other games. Just sayin' :)"

								Steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ made by the most incompetent developer team in the world. They legitimately can´t fix ANYTHING in this game without causing something else to break. You wait a month, two for the next patch just to find out that the majority of the issues aren´t addressed, some bugs are months and months and months old. Servers are some of the worst in the industry, de-sync is at least a full second in this game and after most of your deaths you'll be left with legit question marks above your head on how did you just die?!?! Skill gap in this game is very little because of how random it is and inconsistent. You can Two tap one guy and then a minute later witness majority of your bullets do nothing to the next guy and end up dead, get a frame skip where your game legit freezes for a split second or get crazy lag/de-sync where you peak back behind the corner but the guy still gets a shot or two or ♥♥♥♥ing two taps your ♥♥♥ even though you got behind cover. Hit registration is just awful and the guns in general are inconsistant, especially shot gun. Sometimes you one shot kill someone full health 10 feet away and the next time you stick your shotgun into the guys mouth, deepthroating him to no effect, not even a gag. Basically, you're rolling a dice in every gun fight. 

TL:DR. This game is garbage and i hope DayBreak sells it to some big time Publisher that will pass it to a competent dev team to piece it together. Then i hope that the whole staff of DayBreak studios buys themselves tickets to a cruise and hits an iceberg, causing the ship to sink."

								Has a DayZ feel to it. Delevopers dont do ♥♥♥♥ but release bad content like crates and skins. Last update they fixed 5 minor bugs while people still are able to exploit door closing and jumping to get access to otherwise unaccesable rooftops. 

Netcode is awful and has happened more than once where youre driving shotgun in a car and you shoot infront of your driver - Visibly a lot ahead of the driver - but still manage to hit your teammate in the face because the animation and hitbox arent in sync. Getting shot around corners is a constant threat and is just a part of the game by now.

Been a long time where ""pro"" players were able to just prone spam and run where you'd gain an advantage of hitbox moving - Alongside ♥♥♥♥ netcode made this almost luck to hit someone while they were doing so. Hasnt been fixed but they said it will be fixed next patch...

Shooting in vehicles again as shotgun can derp your gun and it wont reload a full mag but rather the amount you chose to reload at while in the car. Youre forced to empty the mag or either just reload to the amount before reload. Dropping and picking your gun up again will fix this but ♥♥♥♥ annoying.

Cars randomly drop into the ground, explode or go full speed for no reason without you touching keys.

The community is ♥♥♥♥ in solo BR. People team up and theres done nothing to prevent it. When a special event was live called Green Dawn everyone just had to accept that the last 10 players most likely were a mixed group of teamers. A patch which disabled several people in one car in these solo queues only made it more likely that they were on foot. 

The report key is pathetic and no action is taken. Could just aswell remove it.

People load it differently. You can be shot by someone you havnt loaded in yet and they can see you but you cant see them. Only happens at long ranges though. Still stupid that players dont load in same way as cars does at range and is always present. 

And so on. Lots of issues, little or no action is taken to fix these. Could be the same issue with DayZ where a very small team if developers are supposed to take care of this game which a rather large fanbase which no where near covers the need. 

Game has potential - Not worth buying at the moment.

EDIT: 
Bonus info after seperation and patching you now get hitmarkers!
Those hitmarkers are so unreliable even the chinese would call that ♥♥♥♥ back from the factory.
Your thirdperson camera is now so clunky it gets blocked by the flies flying around and you get the feeling of being in a badly cut south african slum movie.
0/10 for effort on that patch. Atleast we can see that you killed people with a grenade now! Awesome."

								Before you start saying ""It's Early Access bro, 420 blaze it, china #1, SAMMIT"" that I know most people that play this game would say... This game is buggy, and it gets worse and worse.  Today I died by a vehicle in 1-man BR while I was parachuting in. I spawned in and fell to my death way up in the sky.  Another time I was standing in a kitchen tearing up clothes to make bandages, and I died.  The kill message said ""better luck next time"", normally it says who killed you and how much life they had.  I have died 3 out of 5 times due to bugs, and in Just Survive people can glitch invisible.  

Now before you say ""it's in Alpha"", this is where i say, I'm trying to prevent people from wasting their money on an unfinished game.  Wait until it is finished or comes out to beta, in probably 37 years.  There are plenty of other alternative games that are less buggy that you can play for a few years before this one is ready. 



 Do your research before buying a game!!"

								Had great potential but the company can't seem to handle coding properly. Breaking stuff that worked perfectly fine and changing stuff that doesn't need changed. All about making $$$$ by bringing out crates after crates instead of making the game better."

								are your devs 12 years old? I mean really how do you make such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game?
 the concept is brilliant but the development is crap.  I have to alt tab out and kill the process half the time just to exit the game.  my mouse cursor dissappears so once again i have to kill the process.  game crashes for no reason.  these are things i would think you would address at the beginning not half way throught development."

								Too broken, ive had  atleast 3 different types of car glitches, not enough veichles to get away from the smoke, people running thru closed doors, also you can't even heal in the car as passenger while your buddies driving;then theres dying in less than a sec after landing, wouldnt it just be easier to have a 10-30 sec safety looting period for people who just landed, so they dont get shot by those who have already been looting 5 min before them. I think it's important since i occasionally or always land in already started match...



now i cant even get in the car for fear of it killing me, nor can i even rely on doors to do their job: all of this in one match and don't forget the bullets that seem to go through anything."

								This game may have its bugs and glitches, but that whats makes the game fun to. The game is in early Access so there is going to bugs and its not game breaking the bugs are maybe your car blows up for no reason or your shots don't register but that doesn't happen every game. And for people complaining about, get better at the game. I've won many games when my shots wern't registering and if I lost I play another one. The game is a super fun game. I REALLY RECCOMEND IT."

								game is awesome, a lil buggy but they do their best for the money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥s they are, as for the hackers ♥♥♥♥ i dont get people complaining ive run into about a couple dozen MAX in over 2000hrs...love the randomness and how every gunfight can be unique in a certain way or another, only thing i hate they did was take the jumpshotting out, there isnt much movement already for gun fights so that i feel could have stayed in, either way the game is coming into its own and within another year should be fully polished. 9.7/10 (as i have patience and realize things dont happen over night, yea they ♥♥♥♥ up with patches every now and again but exclude all that and just look at the game 9.7/10 easy)"

								At the first time there were tickets that should give you an access to play Battle Royale, this obviously didn't make any money for developers, so they decided to split a 20€ Early Access game to two 20€ games (now you actually have to pay 40€ to get ""both"" of their games in Early Access. They promised that the game is going to be F2P at some point, but instead of that, they decided to make even bigger moneygrab. Once I thought that Early Access games are here because the devs want to get feedback from the community, to make a better game, to track bugs and so on. But that's obviously not true anymore. Early Access games are here to steal your money - at least Daybreak is.

If you want to play a real Battle Royale, go and grab Arma III, after all - Battle Royale was developed mainly for it, this game only stole it."

								Lets see here, if you were to ask me if I think that you should buy this game I'd put it quite simply like this. If you are looking for an experience in which not what you see is what you get, then you need to look no further than this specimen we see here that acummulates all of the negative aspects a game should not hold over time based on the lack of leadership and moderation in itself, with these values it also embodies what we all hate, faggarinos, and that is quite literally the largest problem that is visible throughout the community itself, which correlates to the high level of dissatisfaction that everyone, including leprechauns, has to deal with on a mental and metaphysical level every single second this atrocious lump of mucus is alive.

								I've played this game many hours and mostly with having fun, but the devs dont give a single ♥♥♥♥ about the game.

They release a new update with some ♥♥♥♥ing skins you cant even sell on the market and ppl try hard the ♥♥♥♥ out of them and play at least in a team of two.

But thats not the only negative thing about the game.
The Developers dont do ♥♥♥♥ about the game and its still alpha after 1 1/2 years of doing nothing but making money and ♥♥♥♥ing the ppl that spent money for their ♥♥♥♥ing buggy ♥♥♥♥ game. Dont buy it, trust me the game is just ♥♥♥♥ing cancer."

								Okay I'm gonna start this off with the fact that for the most part, King of The Kill can be a very fun game to play with friends. Killing others is satisfying and the gunplay has a learning curve that may take a while to get used to (it took me about 2 months). I personally feel like i got my 20 dollars worth. However, this game has more issues tan you can count. The main issue is that the developers are greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who just want yor money and don't really seem to care about anything but your money. This game was intended to be free to play after it was finished, but just recently they made the content that was oroginally $20 to $40. Instead of giving us updates with bug fixes and more content that will make the game more complete, the devs decided that they would spend the majority of their time just harvesting our money via case openings. The developers priorities are ♥♥♥♥ing embarrasing, sorry for the language. A few months ago they removed molotov cocktails since they had some sort of bug going on with them. They haven't been put back in the game, and im assuming the devs just figured we'd forget about them because the update after they removed, they decided we didnt want fixed game mechanics, instead we wanted new undies. That's right, they released an update after removing the molotovs thats main purpose was to add a few new character skins, and change the color of their underwear. I honestly can't understand their thought process when they first started the game it had such promise, but now they've smeared ♥♥♥♥ all over those promises and made themselves possibly the worst developers of all time. Buy this game if you like killing people and simply that. If you expect the game to be more than justs uing the same guns and cars every game, you will be dissapointed. The game lacks content severly, but it is damn fun to kill someone who's been trash talking you (which will happen pretty much every game since the community is just a bunvh of edgy children)

If I were to give this game the rating it truely deserves it would be a 1/10."

								Before telling you why the game is a no go, I have to say that I enjoy playing it with my friends its a lot a fun, we have a lot of PVP action and funny moments, but this game is glitchy as ♥♥♥♥. I will be naming the pros and cons just so you can make a decision for yourself.(*In my opinion* If you don't have any friends to play with don't buy it...)

PROS:

-The PVP is quite good and comparing to other BR games, its the best out there,
-If you have friends it can be an emerging experience and a lot of fun.
-The gun mechanics are somewhat cool.
-The variety of items in the game, even though there are barely some, have some use and you will most likely like them.
-Car mechanics are somewhat decent.
-A lot of places to loot.

CONS: (Im starting from the glitches that happen from the loading screen untill we are on the arena)
-When entering the game if you have a bad connection so many glitches will happen, like not having a parachute, landing under the map, landing and then 2 seconds into the game dying to the environment, etc...
-Sometimes while trying to enter a car you will receive a message saying ''Something is in the way'' and you won't be able to enter.
-Jumping from a 2 feet rock will make you lose HP.
-Some players either are hacking or have an amazing aim, you will see this since they hit you from over 100 meters, every single shot and this is annoying because if you stop to shoot at them you miss every shot when on the other hand they hit every single one.
-When you shoot at someone, and you are sure you tagged him, after he kills you, sometimes you will see his HP at 0 but he will still be running and jumping.
-Entered a jip, waited for my friend he entered aswell, turned on the engine pressed W to go foward and died to ''Disconnect''.
-The bombs dropped from the plane are bad since the day I bought this game which was over a year now, if they drop on top you you probably won't die unless you have like 10 HP.
-There is a rank system which im not even sure if you play against your own rank. (I was on the worst one Silver V and saw guys that would hit someone 100 meters away and 2 tap them).
-There is a level system which every 5 levels you get an unlocked case and you can open them to get some clothes, we should get cases every level because on the higher ones it becomes a grind to level up.
-When you finish in the top 10 you get nothing, you only win something if you bet on yourself free coins which after finishing in top 15 (I think) gets you skulls to unlock the limited clothes they have on the skull shop, and it only has like 10 cosmetics.

***SIDE NOTE***

The developers of this game are the worst, they only care about your money. After buying the game from SONY they decided to split the game (H1Z1: Just Survive and H1Z1: King of the Kill) this was the most stupid business stunt I have ever seen in my life (Since now Just Survive has pretty much no interest to them). They did this to have a team working on Just Survive and another team working on KOTK, LOL, since Just Survive is getting little to no updates I don't think they are putting much effort into it. KOTK is pretty much a carnival party at this point, all you see is players dressed up in a huge amount of colors that make them look like ♥♥♥♥ing clowns. The KOTK game became a pay-2-dress and everytime they update the game we only see cases, little tweaks to guns and no major/game breaking glitches getting fixed. You pay 20$ (or 10$ on sale) to play a game that its main focus is who looks the prettiest. Or pay 20$ (or 10$ on sale) for Just Survive to play a game that has basically no updates and the dev team doesn't really care about. In my opinion you shouldn't buy the game but after what you read you make your own decision."

								When H1Z1 was released the Battle Royale part of it was cool for an early access game.

Now one years later they split the game into two, still charging the same price for only one half of the game.

								Steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ made by the most incompetent developer team in the world. They legitimately can´t fix ANYTHING in this game without causing something else to break. You wait a month, two for the next patch just to find out that the majority of the issues aren´t addressed, some bugs are months and months and months old. Servers are some of the worst in the industry, de-sync is at least a full second in this game and after most of your deaths you'll be left with legit question marks above your head on how did you just die?!?! Skill gap in this game is very little because of how random it is and inconsistent. You can Two tap one guy and then a minute later witness majority of your bullets do nothing to the next guy and end up dead, get a frame skip where your game legit freezes for a split second or get crazy lag/de-sync where you peak back behind the corner but the guy still gets a shot or two or ♥♥♥♥ing two taps your ♥♥♥ even though you got behind cover. Hit registration is just awful and the guns in general are inconsistant, especially shot gun. Sometimes you one shot kill someone full health 10 feet away and the next time you stick your shotgun into the guys mouth, deepthroating him to no effect, not even a gag. Basically, you're rolling a dice in every gun fight. 

TL:DR. This game is garbage and i hope DayBreak sells it to some big time Publisher that will pass it to a competent dev team to piece it together. Then i hope that the whole staff of DayBreak studios buys themselves tickets to a cruise and hits an iceberg, causing the ship to sink."

								Just some handy advice for the company that's making this game ( don't make another game after this). You guys just got lucky with this. It ""HAD"" something.

Money whoring out all of your customers isn't the way to treat the ones that were intrested in your ♥♥♥♥ing game. Instead of making some ♥♥♥♥ing cases you guys should've made more weapons, more fun and more cars. Alpha = moneywhoring until no one cares anymore and drop the game...

G ♥♥♥♥ing G losers.

*New update came out called ""fagnition""
Another freaking reason to not buy this game, good idea for a gamemode yeah but ♥♥♥♥ over the shotguns and make them shoot across the map without an easy to control recoil... nice

You plebs can keep on recommending and I'll never care I'm just trying to warn the people reading this to NEVER buy anything from this company because it's terrible... They had a chance and they had to come out with 1 update of 1.1gb of pure horse ♥♥♥♥.

Like come on? Think about it, you're having a stroll, some weird ♥♥♥ shows up with a shotgun 50 metres away and he one taps you with a shotgun... Very nice...

I just have one question for you developpers out there, are you TESTING your updates?!"

								Do not buy any of the games, dont support the devs with your money.

Imagine a game that has very little content, is poorly optimised, and is in pre alpha.
Charging 20 dollars for that is absurd imo, now imagine half of the game being cut and sold as separate games, both costing 20 dollars. wich means you have to pay 40 dollars for the complete game, when earlier you only had to pay 20. wich was already too much imo. 40 dollars for a game with very little content is just absurd, and to top it of, it's buggy as ♥♥♥♥ and filled with hackers, and nothing is being done about it.

The game has some potential, Battle royal is fun to play when it's not bugged out and hackers aren't flying everywhere. But i wouldn't hold my breath, the devs dont seem to care about the game at all."

								This half ♥♥♥♥♥ game is yet another example of how greedy game devs release half a product and then split into 2 seperate products that are incomplete and buggy as ♥♥♥♥, then keep it in alpha stage so they have an excuse for it.
the idea of the game is good, but the game devs just want your money and dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about game quality
would not recommend AT ALL"

								Do not waste your money on this game. Biggest regret i have for a game in recent memery. Not only that they took a unfinished early access game and split in into 2 different parts. Then they Sold each part for the original cost of the Original game(amazing). We as gamers NEED to have some self control(include myself) and stop buying this crap.

2/10 would not buy again"

								The game is full with bugs and glitches, but it worth its price. The game so much amazing. I played it from the start of season 1 up to season 3. In every update, the game is getting better and better. I recommend this game for all the gamerz the i know. You will never be disappointed from this game. The game is awesome. All you need to do is to learn how to play the game and understand it. It has special and diffifcult aiming which isn't like any game. Aiming is hard for everyone and this is why it it amazing for me. You will look to improve your self everyday and you will see that you are aiming better from time to time. You have many options to do in the game. I give 9/10 vote for the game. I really like it.

Training mode up to now is very bad. You need to read and watch twitch, youtube ,etc... to know how to aim with each weapon in the game, because all the weapons are different in aiming. There is no training mode that you can train your self with guns aiming to bots or any objects with different difficulites. Also, There is no instruction for the beginners about what they should do in game and how they craft everything.

Wishing that daybreak give more care about the game glitches and bugs to fix them.

Regards,
Hyp"

								Been playing for 12 hours, and nothing but sheer dissapointment. There is litterally no lag compensation, so unless you live in places other then where the servers are located you can forget it. There is a serious need for bug reviews! the fact that i have to delete app data every time i want to launch the game, as well the fact that you tend to fall through the floor and get  no hit reg. This game honeslty sucks huge dog ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and i wouldnt reccomend it to anyone. I cant believe what a waste of time this game is."
