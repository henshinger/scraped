												This is a great game and pretty addictive at that; with the ability to customize charecters to represent yourself and your friends, and a catchy themetune to boot its a fun game to play in short bursts. Don;t be surprised if you die a lot though, as you will die. A lot.

Not called DEATH road to Canada for no reason after all :P"

												For me, the thing that really makes this game fun is putting friends and family into the game and watching the chaos that ensues.  The game plays a bit like Oregon Trail in terms of managing resources like food and bullets while traveling across the country.  You also have to make decisions about how to handle various situations that come up, like running into a massive group of zombies and having to decide whether to take a detour or try to plow through them.  Depending on the traits of your characters, you may have additional options in these instances.  

The other half of the game is running around city streets and various buildings searching for supplies while avoiding getting killed by zombies.  The combat can feel a little clunky, particularly when dealing with doors and corners, but doesn't detract from the game too much.  Character movement also feels a little flawed.  Navigating corners and narrow spaces can get a bit frustrating when your character seemingly gets stuck on nothing.  I also found the companion AI to be a bit annoying at times.  Their path-finding can be frustrating, they will often continue to walk into objects instead of just walking around them.

This game really shines in it's character design, decision making, and quirky humor.  You're able to give your characters a perk, like mechanical or medical skills, and personality trait, like being calm under fire or paranoid.  It creates humorous situations like when your co-worker complains about Mondays the whole trip, or when your fitness obsessed friend challenges bandits to a body builder pose-off.  

Overall I found this game to be a very enjoyable experience.  I would recommend this game to people who enjoy replaying games to see all the different outcomes to different decisions you make.  If your goal is to just get through the game to see the end, there may not be enough value here for you.  Otherwise, there's enough content to warrent playing the game multiple times, even after finshing it."

												Highly recommended. Great retro style graphics with a clear design and aesthetic throughout and awesome gameplay to go right along with it. Combines excellent action elements with enough randomly generated events to continue to be awesome, interesting, and different on each run through. Easy to pick up but rewards repeated plays as you try different combinations of characters and if the developers past games are any indication expect some great additional content updates."

												Death Road to Heart Attack

This here is a short quirky like zombie survival story with packed replayability with the multiple modes you can choose to activate for your run. 
No one cares about the rest though because there is one mode that will make you think you are dying! 
In DR2C there is a mode that allows you to create avatars with limited visual cusomization paired with an expertise or something like that and a trait option. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMIRY! SO I myself did so. The mode called familiar faces made it so the charac ters you would encounter would first pull from the pool of all your ""friends and family.""
In short I went on an adventure with familiar peoples in an intense situation. There were laughs, we would argue. At times we wouldn't speak to each other, or maybe we would discuss art and the moon nonstop. The characters attitude variations may not be exact on point, but when you see it, it is close enough. I felt their fear and screams as we lost our car to bandits, when we were chased to our new graves inside that damn bar. I have PTSD now 10/10 this ♥♥♥♥ is better than the christopher walkin dead!!!"

												I've been following Rocketcat Games for years now, since their early iOS days...
While I had been thoroughly disappointed in that they weren't making games for PC, I was thrilled when the kickstarter released for this game.

Sadly, I didn't have the funds to back it at the time, although it's great to see a kickstarter game that actually gets finished.

The game is really great. It's tough, like every rogue-like Rocketcat game.
Randomness sometimes doesn't seem too random, seems to give dull loot and dull character encounters. Especially when you modify the save files and find out what in all is actuall IN this game.

In the end, I wish there was more to the game, but I am still very satisfied with my purchase. The devs seem to be continuously adding. Highly recommend this game."

												I may not have that many runs in yet but this game is great. My best run so far was when my buddy had dog friend as a perk and kept attracting dogs to the cause. About five days in I felt I was doing well then it happened. A seige completly devasted me killing the two humans in my party. One getting trapped in the horde and the other overcome by the grief of losing his partner charged head first shooting his shotgun as much as possible. All the while my lassy dog fighting with all its heart trying to save who ever was left. It only lasted seconds though the lassy all that remained. Making a getaway just as the horde closed in the dog was all I had left. Then my lassy decided it was time to stick those keys into the ignition and drive. The next day my lassy was mauled by a moose it was trying to help and thus ended my best run. 10/10"

												I played this game when it came out, and was on the fence about it. Since then, it's had a lot of patches, re-balances, and content updates, and they've made the game much more fun. Ammo is a little more plentiful, weapons last a little longer, it's easier to gain momentum as you go. There are higher difficulties for those who want it, but normal no longer feels arbitratily punishing.

Further, I had a man get too sad to continue on the Death Road, and so he trained the dog that was his only companion to drive and told him to go and make him proud. Shotgun-wielding dog then made it to Canada.

A+. 5/5. Jasper is the best dog."

												You better COOL IT!
(mini-review)

Fantastic game, seriously. Music and visuals are top-notch and the game has a lot of humour and personality. It's super fun adding your own characters to it too. I also like the interactive aspect, which allows you to scavenge for supplies and control how you get them, rather than have it be completely RNG. Experienced no crashes over 7 hours, but apparently they are there for others.

It's a lovely game, and game from Rocketcat. Definitely check it out if you're up for an Organ Trail esque game...TO CANADA!

												Although there have been other games that throw Oregon Trail’s ideas into a zombie apocalypse, like some of the best roguelikes (Dungeons of Dredmor being another), Death Road balances its difficulty with a ton of humor and a lighthearted soundtrack. Whenever you lose a party member to zombie death or an unlucky bee sting, there’s some gag or funny line there to break the tension. 

In one playthrough, I:

Rode across the apocalypse in an ice cream truck
Lifted barbells in a zombie-filled gym, boosting my strength
Tore through the undead with a mop
Declined to purchase anime
Was attacked by ants in my sleep
Befriended an Elvis doppelgänger
Was ambushed by a ranting old man who, despite not looking dangerous, killed me

I also love that you can create and save custom characters—I re-created the duo from Zombies Ate My Neighbors."

												More than just a bunch of combat & survival gameplay, DR2C is a story creator. On my very first playthrough, I really felt invested in the characters I managed to save and recruit -- they had personalities, skills and weaknesses, and felt like real, fleshed-out characters. Their adventure was marked by funny moments, big losses and lucky finds. Their ending was brutal and tragic. I expect to have thoroughly different experiences on each playthrough and look forward to that."

												An innovative take on the thoroughly explored fiction of zombie survival.

												I loved Darkest Dungeon, the idea of sending a party of your friends into random situations is a great one. Death Road to Canada uses a similar system, however instead of walking through dungeons you are adventuring on to Canada. On your way to Canada you will experience a vast number of different events. These events can range from meeting travellers that end up joining your party to encountering bandit, bodybuilding enthusiasts. These events are the foundation for the game and offer plenty of re-playability to the game itself. 

Exploration
Moving on from the in-game events, lets address one of the negatives I have with the game, exploration. Each building you venture into is extremely lacking in the creativity department. Most buildings will be filled with gas, food and weapons. The problem is to find all of them, you will want to search every room, this creates very boring scenarios of you and your friend searching through empty rooms which are literally empty. They could have atleast added some furniture to make them feel more authentic, but instead if you enter a room with nothing but a bunch of garbage blocking off a door. You instantly know to turn around because it will be one of the MANY empty and pointless rooms in this game. Just to clarify my criticism here Is that the rooms are completely baron of ANYTHING, they didn’t have to contain usable items, but I would have liked to see these rooms contain some sort of personality or baring. Not only did this make exploration, long and arduous but it really encouraged players to skip exploring entirely If they already had enough supplies to last them a while. 

Visuals/Graphics
And now is the part of every review where I talk graphics. Now this game has that same pixelated art style we have all become VERY familiar with over the years. It seems that after one game tried using this retro look EVERY possible indie promotion started using it for reasons I can’t recognise. Luckily here it fits decently, as the world created around your survivors is wacky enough to fit the strange 80’s style visuals. 

Performance
No surprise here with its low CPU and GPU intensive graphics, the game runs fineand they offer you some nice, complementary options; fliters for the screen if you want to go full 80's mode, stylistic screen tearing toggle options and fully rebindable keys. I should also mention that all actions in the game can be changed on controller as well as the keyboard, when you are playing co-op with a friend I found that this was a nifty addition to controller users.

Music
As for the music, it’s quite strange. Normally in a zombie game where you’re fighting for survival you wouldn’t have fun up-beat music sounding off in the background. But much like the visuals it works well with the cheesy game the developers are creating. It took me a while to get used to it but after I did, I can’t imagine going back to the solemn soundtracks of past zombie games. 

Combat
Combat feels decent enough, it doesn’t take away anything from the game but it felt too basic to warrant praise of any kind. In combat you can use guns, melee weapons and explosives. Melee weapons use up your character’s stamina, your character’s stamina is measured in the traits your character has unlocked. Obviously more physically athletic survivors will be able to use their melee weapon for longer without getting tired. The gun play is fine, the game automatically locks on to zombies you are facing which works well enough. I am slightly dissapointed as it felt like the developers were catering a little too much to the controller users rather than the much more plentiful keyboard and mouse users, thsi is ecspecially the case with the gun play, it felt like their main goal was to dumb it down completely so that controller users wouldn't be left behind by the vastly superior PC controls. But in saying that, it's not necessarily a bad system of combat, I just feel like it takes away the benefit of using a keyboard and mouse to a slight degree, and let me highlight the word slight, this is a MINOR nitpick. 

Conclusion
Overall Death Road to Canada is a fun game to play with your friends, you can laugh at the random events that occur and dance to the funky music playing in the background while killing zombies constantly. However, without friends this game is quite bland, exploration is quite a linear experience and on your own the combat feels dreadfully average."

												This game is as addicting as it is similar to playing FTL but with zombies and decisions. You and your party have to escape to the borders of Canada since the USA is having a zombie apocalypse and oh boy, you will have a variety of choices and events in your journey since the destination is sort of like reaching Mt Everest or finding a lost treasure. In gameplay, you have to loot resources from places from food to gas, weapons, etc in order to survive the journey. But be careful, zombies in this game are numerous so you have to be hasty or cautious depending on what you're dealing with and have to battle your way in and out. You also have to plan ahead as your resources easily run out.

Pros:

+ Replayability (You will get a lot of game overs if you're not prepared. The fact you have plenty of customization as well as events to help you succeed is why it's really enjoyable whenever I repeat the game. Wanna go Leeroy Jenkins? Get a BERSERK character. Rather play safe and smart? Paranoid characters are your brains.)

+ Variety (Characters, weapons, events, cars, etc, I lost count how many events there are and some are even references to characters from games, movies, real life people, etc. I won't spoil who but it's a lot fun discovering the silly references the devs put in. The characters also have their own stats and traits so keep in mind on them. )

+ Customization (You can customize characters that you wanna put in like naming them  because they'll appear in the game when you find them. The strong parts are the traits and perks you can put in which have their pros and cons. They can help you or betray you depending on the situation)

+ Music (For a zombie apocalypse game, it sure fits well with some happy ones as well as 'LET'S KICK SOME ZOMBIE BUTT"" music. Very enjoyable. )

+ Graphics (Pixel art as the main art style, it's simple but it shows it really well. I do wish the characters faces look a little better but hopefully in a sequel or such, they'll make it better)

+ Dogs/Cats are playable (They can loot and shoot...SOLD! )

I don't have much cons for this game but I'll just give my little nit picks

Nitpicks:

- RNG (RNG is what makes the fun and despair of a game though I feel that a lot of bad stuffs happen more to me IMO. Though that's part of the fun so take this as a grain of salt.)

- More character customization ( I know this is a pro but I do want more clothes or at least a workshop for this game. If there's mods I would love to see it happen)

Overall, I give this game a 9/10. I would have given it a 10 if it had a lot more customization than now because the game literally screams for one. If this game were to get a sequel then I'd be a happy man. If you love zombies, surviving, FTL-like games, maybe this might be for you. Otherwise, just look at a video or 2 of gameplay and see if it convinces you to buy.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

												I kickstarted this game an age ago on a whim, when I got fed up with waiting for Project Zomboid which it has become synonymous for.
Today, I finally decide to give it a go only a few hours before launch.
My surprised was welcome, as this is really fun. 
Like a beat-em-up crossed with Oregon Trail (or Organ Trail) the amount of replayability that is in this game is astounding.

These types of proceedural generated games can live or die on their variety and this game has it in spades. I have played through only 10 games so far, all dying and have loved nearly every moment of it.
There are downsides such as the graphics which on a small budget is understandable.
Also the music is grating at times, with the main theme chiptune track being the worst offender.
And be prepared to have this game crash often.

Pros
+The combat is simple but fun
+The stats for characters add a nice mechanic
+Has heaps of replayability
+Unique characters and scenes are great
+Good dev that is active on the forum and listens

Cons
-Crashes
-Very simple pixel graphics
-Music is hit and miss"

>Nothing too weird or exciting happens
>One day they raid a sports goods store
>Negan finds a baseball bat in that store
>I decide to have him weild it, just like in the show
>Few days pass, looking good

>Tensions rise between Michonne and the Governor
>Keep going until we find a factory
>We go deep into the factory and get a little lost
>Zombies start piling up
>Oh dear
>Negan is stuck in another room

>Rush in after him
>Room is covered in zombies
>Negan is covered in zombies
>I watch him die before my eyes
>Michonne followed me in
>All the zombies following her are now in here'
>I'm pushed to the middle of the room
>Michonne leaves the room as I'm engulfed in walkers
>Governor and Negan are dead
>Michonne goes on for a few more days
>Huge seige alert
>Michonne has to survive 2 hours
>Pinned down in under one
>I walk into another room
>Zombies eating someone
>Police officer runs in
>All the walkers following him run in
>Flashbacks
>I'm in the center of the room

												Her name was Ora, she was a dog, and this is her tail...*baddum tst*

I rescued Ora from a zombie infested apartment building, Ora had placed a banner out front which read ""Bark! Bark!"" Clearly a cry for help.

Ora became an invaluable member of the team, more than pulling her weight in combat, picking up grenades, and outting me for farting in the car via an extremely complex deductive process. However the defining victory of Ora was when heavily armed bandits and their totally not Immortan Joe leader had blocked the road before us and demanded all our food, weapons, supplies, and even our car! Ora had a plan, Ora always  had a plan. Ora proceeded to honk the horn, which amused the bandits to no end upon seeing an animal doing that. They let us through unharmed, we celebrated by robbing a lone trader.

Our merry band of jerks was not too stay bonded forever. We had stopped at a non-descript town to scavange for supplies, the zombies were out thick that day and so we had to do a lot more smashing, shooting, and running than usual. By the time we had picked the town clean it was swarming like a bee hive on Honey Day and we were firing all our guns to get out. In the Chaos I lost sight of Ora....I didn't notice her absence until we were in the car and pulling away...the last image I have of her is seared in my mind, valiantly wielding a golf club, hundreds of zombies closing in...

We died horribly just south of the border, and we deserved it for leaving Ora behind..

												Death Road to Canada is a joyous romp through Florida on your journey to the zombie-free country of Canada, filled with guns, gas, and blood. It takes the formula of Organ Trail and beefs it up with a healthy dose of Dead Rising’s furniture-smashing chaos and Scott Pilgrim Vs. The Game’s retro Beat-Em-Up silliness and manages to combine it all into a fun, hilarious mess that’s addictive for hours on end. I’ve yet to make it to Canada alive yet, but where many games of its ilk have often made me give up on trying, Death Road to Canada’s optimism and forgiving nature made me feel that one day I could actually do it. Not to mention it’s a ton of fun! If there’s a game that could prove that the zombie genre isn’t quite out of fuel just yet, Death Road to Canada and the broken down lemon it rides around in is definitely that game.

Now I love the various encounters with famous people and dogs and even being able to create my own friends and family. I have gotten to the last siege of the game 9 times now and I still havn't gotten past it. But hey all the more challenging I think this is a wonderful game and its a more awesome idea so far I have met Elvis, Jason Voorhees, a bodybuilder type that doesnt seem to have any attacks, an old women that can box, a luchadore, ALOT of diff. dog breeds, I love how th UI is set up and really like the little stats each person has and that you can even upgrade the traits by completing the random things the upgrades tell you to do  and how to get it and what not I really like the music and very catchy even going as far as catching myself humming it every once and awhile. Im so excited to see more of the updates to come out and I really want to see what type of potential this game has.
TL:DR-I LOVE DA GAME IT GOOD!"

												An top down survival horror affair. Like Organ Trail but with more action and less Rest (4 Hours). It keeps the tone light and campy-- Canada is the last surviving nation in the world, escape to it and live out the zombie apocalypse.

As an example of a winning game: I started with two random characters because I was tired of getting my brother and I killed by zombies. Turns out I met both myself and my bro on the way there. I died to zombies, and my brother made it to a scientific lab alone, where a ""science machine"" turned him INTO A DOG. He then proceeded to drive the car all the way up to Canada, where he became what I assume must be the first honorary talking, sentient dog-citizen of the Great Nation of Canada. This, after fighting off the incoming hordes with a chainsaw and the aid of the Mounties.

The permadeath is frustrating, but the lighthearted writing and sharp, simple gameplay will keep you coming back until you make it to America's Hat."

												More than just a bunch of combat & survival gameplay, DR2C is a story creator. On my very first playthrough, I really felt invested in the characters I managed to save and recruit -- they had personalities, skills and weaknesses, and felt like real, fleshed-out characters. Their adventure was marked by funny moments, big losses and lucky finds. Their ending was brutal and tragic. I expect to have thoroughly different experiences on each playthrough and look forward to that."

												Basically RNG: The Game. 

Everything in this game is RNG, essential supplies is from RNG, HEALING event is RNG (WTF?), recruitment is from RNG, events are RNG (Usually never good, just RNG of which bad events you get), and the RNG in the game is designed against you.

The first layer of RNG is the crashes, if you survived that and thought you are good, don't worry, you are not, the rest of the RNG is by design.

For example, I made a healing character, had plenty of med supplies, but that character will never trigger the healing event even though people are almost dead. Then later down the road she died trying to pull her teeth out even though according to the dialog choice she use to be a dentist. 

Or another example, I made a mechanic to fix cars, but the game always insist on making my healer fix the car. And of course she can't fix the car because her stats in mechanics is too low, so on top of losing the car, she's also in a bad mood, which if low enough the member will leave permanantly.

Also your main NEEDS to be an mechanic because the moment you are on foot when your car breaks down, you either get robbed of all your supply (you can choose to fight the bandits but the RNG never let me win yet), or you lose your life tripping and hurt yourself on flat road (again WTF?). And once your food is all robbed, and your healing supply is all used up, your mood drops to rock bottom, and your character automatically leave the team, even your main character. And then it's game over.

There are so many more problem with this game I just can't be bothered listing them all at this time. The game don't feel complete, interface needs some ironing out, game needs SERIOUS re-balance. And the bugs is in your face, I'm certain the only reason the game have a save feature at all is for crashes. I mean you can't save manually, and you can't leave the game and come back either, I tried and my save is gone once I re-launched the game.

Not adviced to purchase until the game is fixed."

We walked into a fancy house and we both died. Veer took over. He drove Peyton around barking at wildlife and drooling. They found my boyfriend on the side of the road playing video games and picked him up. He died right away. Veer dies as well trying to save him. He was a good dog. Peyton is the only one left. I still didn't trust him. He finds OctoDad on the side of the road, he finally gets in the car. They go to a junkyard for gas and Octodad dies. Then Peyton dies on the way out. Doesn't surprise me everyone dies and Peyton was left. 10/10 for suspcious dogs."

												One part Zombieland, one part roguelike, and one part 2d action brawler, DRtC is the game that we all hope every zombie game will be. It is the game every zombie game promises to be. It's very specifically the game Organ Trail promised it would be.

I wish I was articulate enough to explain why this game is so good, why it's such a delight to play, and why it's so addictive. I can't, but I hope however high my hours played gets for this will serve as a testament.

												“ONWARD TO CANADA!”Death Road to Canada (DR2C for short) is a *perma-death* roguelike survival. Your goal: Drive from Florida to Canada in 15 days. During the trip, you will loot & manage resources, train your characters, meet new people, deal with bandits, and make decisions in many other random events.

”COOL IT”Lovingly crafted in 3 years, DR2C is full of quirky jokes. On the road you will run into many other survivors. A car of up to 4 jerks. During the trip, you will argue and help each other. Whenever you run into a situation, options available to you will depend on the stats of your party members. A high strength character can fight a bear off. A charming person can sometimes get stuff for free at trader camps. There are also rare characters that have unique personalities, stats, abilities, and their own unique events. You can also make your own characters, and they will sometimes show up in the game. (there are also dogs and cats)

Buy NO anime!On the Death Road, you will occasionally find trader camps. The traders are randomized in each camp. Preserved food is used as currency. Sometimes you will even run into rare traders that will trade unique stuff. You need to make very prudent decisions on what to buy and what to sell. When you run out of gas, there is no guarantee that the next trader camp will have a gas trader.

”Is the Death Road really as bad as it sounds?”DR2C is brutally difficult and is not for the faint of heart. To survive the Death Road, you need both strategy and luck. DR2C has perma-death, and encourages you to play carefully rather than ruthlessly. The motivation to finish the game doesn’t come from the action itself. Instead, it comes from the story progression, the excitement of getting closer to the Canadian border day by day. 

tl;drHLTB
Takes ~2 hours to go through the entire Death Road
Takes much longer to beat the game because you’ll fail a lot
PROS
*PERMA-DEATH!!!*
The humor
Good depth
Lots of replayability (random events and characters, other game modes)
Very fun for local co-op
Good soundtrack (10+ tracks)
CONS
AI is sometimes buggy (Sometimes they get stuck picking up and dropping weapons) fixed
Melee becomes useless on the last day, and a high shooting stat is almost essential. A little unfair for strength characters
Your couch friend won’t be able to co-op with you if there is only 1 person in your party
It can be frustrating at times when you get unlucky"

												This game has already brought me so much fun !

First off, the soundtrack :

It may not be the one you'd expect from a game depicting the fall of society and travelling in a deadly environment where you can die any day.
It's more one of an action-packed loot-and-run, inexplicable event-riddled road trip between friends (or are they?) soundtrack, holding a lot of energy and generally transmitting that ""Let's freaking do it"" vibe. I love it, and like listening to it outside of the game from time to time. You can also access it easily in the game files.

The graphics :

I personally like a lot good pixel art, and this one is truly good ! I don't really know what i could add, plus you can easily see for yourself. Pixels done right.

The gameplay :

Movements are fluid, there are a good choice of ways to deal with the zombies when it comes to the action part of the game, such as the classic melee weapons, pistols, shotguns, rifles. You can also sometimes manage to find molotovs, pipe bombs, grenades etc... Moreover, some characters have specific ways to (or not to!) deal with  zombies and get all that sweet loot.
Your ai teammates, if you choose to take any with you during looting missions are good at following you around, managing their stamina (as in not killing non threatening zombies) and shouldnt die stupidly too often.
The only issues i've encountered yet are some with the depths, for example when you think a zombie is farther than you vertically than it really is, and also sometimes walls ""hitboxes"" taking melee hits instead of zombies.

In the other part of the game, wich is managing your road trip across zombinated states toward canada, you are faced with events and a couple of choices. Theses can range to bandit attacks, zombie sieges, picking your looting location, recruiting or not the random survivors you come across along the road, and much more.
This is in my opinion the hardest part of the game, as i've lost more good men to bandits and unfortunate events than zombies, but it's not frustrating at all. You can generally move along without too much damage if your group doesnt have someone able to deal with the situation, and it generally rewards good thinking, instead of having randomly generated outcomes which you don't have control of. To summarize, choices are not always easy, but it's not frustrating either.

There is also a possibility of local coop, but having not tested it I cannot say if it's good or bad, though I'd say having that possibility is a nice plus !

Replayability :

I absolutely guarantee you won't see everyting there is to see in your first playthrough. You most likely won't win it either. There is a lot of elements, characters, items and events to discover, and also a few gamemodes available from the start. Custom characters are a nice addition, and the perks available are progressively upgraded as you play the game. Don't think they are useless from the start either.
I have yet to play the game more, but at roughly 5 hours of play I did not get bored of it for a second, so I'd say the game does have a lot of hours of fun ahead for you.

Overall one of the most fun ""little"" games i've played in a long time. The gameplay, immersion, music are all very good and the humor make this game unique and lovable."

												I highly recommend the game. The gameplay itself is fairly simplistic and reminiscient of FTL. However, what lifts Death Road to Canada above and beyond are its amazing writing and insane sense of humor, which both immediatelly clicked with me and made it the most fun game this year. Totally recommend it, even if you'll have maaaany attempts ahead of you before making it to Canada (or maybe because of it!)."

This game is full of difficult choices. 

Haven't been addicted to a zombie survival game like this since Organ Trail, and while that game is very dear to me...dare I say it, DRTC does it better. It's a beautiful little game. Lots of features and options, sky high replayability and very responsive devs who are STILL working on adding cool features and tweaking the game make this an excellent purchase. I didn't wait for it to come on sale, and feel zero regrets about it. 

In terms of difficulty it is quite punishing. But the journey is enjoyable enough that even when its infuriating, I feel compelled to dive back in. 

This is an absolute treat."

												I may not have that many runs in yet but this game is great. My best run so far was when my buddy had dog friend as a perk and kept attracting dogs to the cause. About five days in I felt I was doing well then it happened. A seige completly devasted me killing the two humans in my party. One getting trapped in the horde and the other overcome by the grief of losing his partner charged head first shooting his shotgun as much as possible. All the while my lassy dog fighting with all its heart trying to save who ever was left. It only lasted seconds though the lassy all that remained. Making a getaway just as the horde closed in the dog was all I had left. Then my lassy decided it was time to stick those keys into the ignition and drive. The next day my lassy was mauled by a moose it was trying to help and thus ended my best run. 10/10"

Started a game, I usually like to pick characters who would be together on the show but I thought I could spice it up for one. I chose The Governor and Negan to be the first to characters.

>Game starts normally
>Nothing too weird or exciting happens
>One day they raid a sports goods store
>Negan finds a baseball bat in that store
>I decide to have him weild it, just like in the show
>Few days pass, looking good
>Find Michonne on the side of the road
>Tensions rise between Michonne and the Governor
>Keep going until we find a factory
>We go deep into the factory and get a little lost
>Zombies start piling up
>Oh dear
>Negan is stuck in another room
>He has good weapons and I can't let him die
>Rush in after him
>Room is covered in zombies
>Negan is covered in zombies
>I watch him die before my eyes
>Michonne followed me in
>All the zombies following her are now in here'
>I'm pushed to the middle of the room
>Michonne leaves the room as I'm engulfed in walkers
>Governor and Negan are dead
>Michonne goes on for a few more days
>Huge seige alert
>Michonne has to survive 2 hours
>Pinned down in under one
>I walk into another room
>Zombies eating someone
>Police officer runs in
>All the walkers following him run in
>Flashbacks
>I'm in the center of the room
>I'm covered in walkers
>Game over

Such an end is fit for a killer like me

The game presents itself in two different play-styles: an Oregan Trail like decision making rpg overworld, and a Nuclear Throne like top down fighter where you scavenge for supplies and weapons. There is also a character customisation where you can design your own characters and give them particular traits to spice up the character, or you can find randomly generated characters to adenture with, topped with some preset special characters that have unique dialog, abilities and weapons. All of this is presented in beautiful and detailed pixel art.

I only have two gripes with DR2C,
-Its difficulty if the first. While I understand that it is a rougelike and your chances of winning consistantly without a high level of practice are very low. This game also heavily relies on good RNG on your characters stats and the events they are put in; which may turn people off. Generally I find there are two ways you can play DR2C, you either play silly in order to have fun, often resulting in bad things happening due to you telling everyone to ""COOL IT"", or you can play super optimally and boring, usually resulting in higher chances of victory but takes away some charm the game has.
-The second is the small amount of bugs the game has. So far my game is unable to enter fullscreen and just makes the screen black, which I assume is a resolution issue. The other problem that has only happened once is the game randomly crashing presenting you with an error code. However, being a newly released game with updates coming out every day, these problems are sure to be fixed if not shortly, in the future.

Overall DR2C is a great pick up game with runs lasting around 30-60 minutes, packed full with hilarious dialog and a vast array of characters. Good times will be had with this game, but if RNG reliant games bug you, you might want to wait till this title is on sale. If not, I highly recommend it!"

												Started the game off by creating my family (dad,mum,brother,nan,uncle and ME!!!!)
Turns out im not good at surviving and i was swiftly killed while trying to work out how the game worked.
My brother was still left though so i went on an adventure!
......And was then pinned down in a ""survive the horde"" sort of game.
Then i found my golf loving dad at a driving range wielding a golf club. 
Things were looking up!
I even replaced a persons head with a pugs head...... because you can do that in this game so why not XD
Then eventually all of the group died when they were left carless and were attempting to get another one.

In summary:
THIS GAME IS AWESOME!"

												It started out as an adventure of my friend, Nic, and I to Canada. We've known each other since we were small. Together we survived some pretty prickly situations and we met a few friends along the way, Rusty and Jacinda. 

We were a rag tag group of survivors content on the idea of making it to Canada. Things were looking great but unfortunately that didn't last long. We had lost our car and were forced to trek on foot. 

After what seemed to be an eternity, we spotted a cabin and a van that resembled a dog. After fighting through the horde of zombies, we managed to find the keys. We struggled to make it back to the van, but we were on our way to Canada once again!

We all were in need of rest after the all the excitement we had endured during the day so we had found an empty house along the roadside. Night was falling upon us, as leader, I appointed Jacinda to barricade duty. This was a fatal decision on my part as leader. I may not have been perfect but I always seemed to keep us on top. Night had fallen and we were surrounded by zombies. With Jacinda's lackluster job, they had been able to break in and we had lost Nic and Rusty. Jacinda and I had narrowly escaped with our lives. 

Bitter towards Jacinda, I knew ultimately it was my decision which had led to the death of my childhood friend, Nic, and our beloved teammate, Rusty. Even after these events, we couldn't forget our initial goal of this journey. It was to make it to Canada. The sacrifice of our friend's could not be in vain. Once again, we pushed on.

Low on supplies and down to just the two of us, we decided to enter a nearby town to gear up. The rain helped muffle our sounds enough to push past the large packs of angry and aggressive zombies. We found a house with enough supplies to last us the remainder of our trip. Now we just needed to get back to our van.

On our way out the door, we noticed the large packs had moved to the outside of the house we were in, and sadly, we were spotted. We had tried to stand our ground, but were quickly overwhelmed and were forced to run. Making a mad dash to our van, we had gotten ourselves surrounded. 

It was in that moment that Jacinda had taken her hatchet and started fighting and pushing her way through one side. Myself and a bloody and beaten Jacinda had managed to make it to the doorway of a small house. She was bitten all over and we both knew that it was over for her. She told me to go inside without her. She said she was sorry but this is where her story ends. Reluctantly, I turned and closed the door.

Here I sit in this small house, alone and waiting for my impending doom while I write this letter. Moans and sounds of limbs banging against the door. I feel at peace.

10/10 Simulator for when 'murica falls because of the Trumpster. Would die travelling to Canada again."

												Great game - and I do not even like zombies. Come, my American friends! Join me here in Canada! I have lost too many friends and family members to Florida - do not add yourself to that terrible toll!

After almost 30 hours, I have not yet made it to Canada (Yes, there is quite a bit of RNG involved in this game - some of it ironic, most of it malicious, a lot of it intentional) but I do not care because the game is AMAZING! And I already live in Canada IRL.

10/10 will recreate my friends just to watch them die again. And again. And again."

												You huddle in your boarded up apartment, surrounded by zombies.  You ran out of food a week ago.  Your last friend died three days ago.  You ran out of bullets yesterday, but you saved one for yourself.  As the zombies tear down the door to your room, you put your pistol to your head and close your eyes.

You hear a familiar jingle in the distance, getting closer.  You open your eyes.  Suddenly one of the walls explodes inwards and a huge vehicle plows through, sending severed limbs and zombie entrails everywhere.  It’s an ice cream truck!  The driver has a green mohawk, and a rusty machete across her lap.  In the back you hear two people arguing about which one of them farted.  The driver throws the door open.

“Get in loser.  We’re going to Canada!”"

												-it was an average day. or so i thought.
-zombies invaded our town so i knew i had to escape to a place with no zombies, canada.
-i took a long a buddy named greg with me to canada. greg was a great  mechanic and doctor so i knew he'd be  perfect
-all was going well, we looted several places, stocked up on food, gas, and medical equipment
-along the road i spotted a dog. i recruited the dog, raliegh, to the team as we had more then enough food
-raleigh was extremely trustworthy and we used him to bride bandits and what not
-we continue our trek to canada, fending off hordes of zombies whilst collecting loots
-we then met peter on the side of the street alone
-knowing we had alot of food we thought another person wouldnt hurt us
-hes a fighter, lets recruit him they said
-look how big he is they said
-he'll be perfect they said
-so we allowed peter to join even though i really did not want to
-none the less he was a fighter and a warrior, and he really helped out the team
-or so we thought
-i began to get excited, as we had plenty of supplies and only 4 days left
-i began to trsut peter, and knowing he was a good shot, i gave him a gun
-and that was all good
-but what happened next will haunt me for the rest of my life
-we ran into a town, and in a house the was a grenade
-at the time i had never used a grenade, so  igave it to peter
-and that was the worst mistake of my life
-the next time we encountered a horde, and just as it looked like we deafeted it, we had not
-peter, who i had begun to trust had turned sides, a traitor as some may say
-he threw the grenade right at all of our feet
-he had instantly killed himself and greg, and severly injured me and raleigh
-flashbacks began to cross my mind of my vietnam days
-me and raleigh believed petercould have been apart of isis
-as we sit there half dead the zombies began to enclosure us
-me and raleigh could not escapeand had died

10/10 would trust an isis member again

												Started a run with myself and a friend. Recruited a dog in the first town. Dog distracted a bandit checkpoint so we could get past. Car broke down. Had the dog break through a zombie swarm and hotwire a sweet new fuel efficient ride. After the food ran out and morale fell through the floor, my friend kicked me out of the group and was subsequently chewed to death in an impossibly dense zombie siege. Dog barely escaped with its life. Game over because nobody was left to drive the car.

2/10, game is racist against dogs."

Most entertaining rouge like game I've ever played.
Funny and rewarding. Coop is ok, just some levels aren't meant for it, but overall it's a perfect couch game. The game feels complete but the release doesn't quite fit. I don't see why this doesn't have achievements or cards. Character creation could use some more options and there could be more skills/skill levels, but that all really can only subtract 1 point. At worst, it's 8 out of 10 for the music being too loud and repetitive. Still, this game is a must have if you are into a challenge or rouge likes or zombies or coop."

												Started with 2 people 1 a mechanic the other a doctor, killed tons of zombies, along the way I picked up some creepy dog thing in a trench coat, zombies sieged us doggie died already, the rest survived the siege, we sped away in our hatchback.

Things started getting rough, everyone was injured and the doctor kept starting fights. My mechanic saw a sasquatch on the side of the road, we turned around the car to investigate, the mechanic took a picture of the sasquatch tracks and became happy again. We saw a nice hotel on the road, the creepy lady wouldn't let us in. So we kept driving, sieged by zombies again, it was at this point where we decided we had enough, we ditched the car and gave up on our journey to canada.

R.I.P. Creepy trench coat dog thing

In another story

I started off with 2 dog lovers one irritating one calm They were doing well on their fantastic journey they started to run out of gas the one based off my friend decided to siphon gas, he wound up accidentily drinking some gas and getting sick. We visited a camp of traders My friend told one of the traders anime isnt real, the trade got mad at us and made us leave. A recruit showed up on the road, my friend told her to cool it and called her a nerd, she got mad and left. A corgi named kim showed up at the side of the road and joined our crew. Bandits stopped us My friend told them to cool it, he got shanked and died. We had lost our car the corgi and my last survivor, Ivan found a car lot and explored it. Ivan died almost instantly. The corgi sprinted through the car lot, jumped in a police car, started it, and sped away. The game ended just there as the corgi couldnt drive (butsomehowcouldstartacarandspeedaway).

Never forget that corgi I hope they are having fun in canada."

												To sum up this game... hummm.  You will die because you open a van door and hot sauce flows out and burns you. You fail to shoot the lock off twinky truck with a shotgun. You fall out of trees, You do massive jumps over huge ledges, you survive massive amounts of zombies through grit and determination, then you die because you swatted a bee. You decide to turn on Rare characters so you can then  repeat the process with Octodad, Link, and Jason Vorheez. then you die because your car broke down and you got attacked like half a million times before finding another one. You then decide to try something new with custom characters of your wife/husband son/daughter father and mother and then you get to see them die because they failed to do hard core parkour, they couldn't putt enough gold balls at the zombies, and because the game was cruel and gave you a sardine packed mega cheezed hour long siege, Aka lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off zombies."

												Incredibly funny.
Incredibly challenging.
Incredibly well done.
A very in-depth zombie survival game with LOTS of content and never the same experience twice.
One of the best rogue-likes I think on Steam right now.
Everyone should honestly give this game a shot. 

I've been a fan of this developer for years since they released Punch Quest (which this game heavily references with its humour). This game has been in the works for years, and it really really shows. I think the icing on the cake is being able to make your own characters, NPC's, and go on an adventure with all of them to escape the zombie hoards. 

*UPDATE FROM ORIGINAL*
The updates to this game have been INCREDIBLE and they keep getting better. This game just continues to constantly improve and blow me away with what they're doing with it. Easily one of my favorite purchases on Steam and always a fun game to come back to."

												Y'ALL BEST DROP FIFTEEN SPARE BUCKS ON THIS GAME IF YA KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YA.

Okay, southern accent aside [blame my upbringing], great af game. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥ to try and beat [throw in some dysentery and you have another Oregon Trail with zombies], but it's still fun. Granted, I grew up in the 90's/00's, not the 80's [this game's aesthetics], but in all honesty, the soundtrack will catch anyone's interest. Hell, just watch the trailer- it capture's the game's style PERFECTLY.

And the gameplay? Ohoho, the gameplay. You want all these zombies dead? Use weapons. Oh no, one of your party members wound up tired from a random encounter event! Time to let them sleep in the car! Oh no, now that you don't have your full party out looting, there're all these cool weapons lying around! Oh WOW! Is that a ninja?! Let's drop some food at her feet and recruit her! Ooh cool, it's Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson [the last bodybuilder]! Let's get fitness tips from him! What?! The ninja disappeared- but we can teleport with those smoke bombs she left behind!
This is all from a single playthrough of this game. I died on the last stretch as Papyrus from Undertale, having started out with Eggman and Metal Sonic from the Sonic franchise.

And for that matter, custom characters. You want to fight zombies as yourself? Well, here's as close as you'll get! Want a crossover of this and another popular game like Overwatch? Click that custom characters button [Starbound is also great for this, by the way].

tl;dr, this game's definitely worth its price. Only problem I have ewith it is that Starbound's been pulling more of my attention lately, haha."

												This game has everything,

Lunk will practice his spin attack in the car if he's unhappy....and kill your team.
A goofy clown will transport you to a haunted clown-of-the-dead cabin for a night of terror.
Dogs can be thrown into science machines to become dog-men....that will waste all of you ammo.
Elvis will threaten the light a bridge on fire and trap a group of people unless they back down...and then he burns it down anyway!
The freest man in the world roams on foot at inscredible speed wearing nothing but a horse mask.

I can go on and on, but just go see for yourself!  The rare character mode alone is enough for a great game, but when you get creative and add your own characters based on friends/family/popular celebs (I like making a Doc Brown and Rick Sanchez party of custom characters to start a trip), and then if they see me with a dog on the side of the raod you better believe it's going to be an amazing adventure."

												If there's one thing I've learned about zombie apocalypses, it's that hardly anyone makes it out alive. 

Especially Carol, my Uzi-wielding wiener dog. 

The fact that a dog can wield an Uzi and broker deals with bandits makes this game delightfully random in the best of ways. 

10/10, would play Carol the Uzi-wielding wiener dog again."

												How can I summarize this game? I started out with a guy who was a friend of dogs. With his best buddy. They got into a fight and split leaving just him on the road with some dogs he picked up. Then he got sick of the road and decided to call it quits. He told the french poodle of the party to remember everything he had taught it and wished the dogs farewell.

Now its just the two dogs driving to canada in an ice cream truck. My poodle become well trained and can also walk around using a pump shotty on two hind legs.

10/10

The game is a mix of oregon trail meets binding of isaac. I love it.

EDIT:
Crashes were fixed ages ago the game keeps getting updated and more improvements made by the devs. I have about 100 hours in this game and I still haven't found everything to find in it. The game offers a lot of play value for 15 bucks and frankly, so far is my game of the year.


Edit 2: 11/28/2016
This is still the best game of 2016 and well worth the price.

Yeah the game has only gotten better and beter. The devs arep utting in a lot of love and deserve credit."

												Take Oregon Trail/Organ Trail's journey and mostly random event and decision making mechanics, add stats to affect combat and events, put yourself in full control of the characters, and add fun mayhem and overwhelming hordes of zombies. 
Death Road to Canada is a game that has a wondeful sense of humor that are both randomly hilarious and have references to pop culture you can infer from events. Having the ability to customize your survivors between naming them, stats, and appearance is a great addition to affecting your decision to figuring out who's expendable, and who you'll dive into the horde of zombies to save. The game has a great looting mechanic that really makes you break all the things to find precious resources to keep heading on to Canada, which you hear is a magical and zombie free safe place."

Along the road we  had to deal with loads of bandits, got really beefy, and charmed a dog into giving us free bullets. Unfortunately we all died at the Canadian border shortly after kicking the first member of the team out for being a grade-A dink.

												   Death Road to Canada is a phenomenal mix of all the zombie games you have played before with Oregon Trail which makes for the most fun zombie apocalypse game in years if ever. This game strips down all of the slower moving aspects of zombie survival into a concise and streamlined re-playable experience. 

   The player controls randomly generated or self-generated characters on a romp from Florida to Canada in hopes to find safe haven. Along the way, resources must be scavenged, zombies must be crushed, allies need to be rescued or recruited, and hope to god the car doesn’t break down along the way.

Strengths:
•	The gameplay is just pure fun. Fast and Frantic with a bit of strategic maneuvering required when things get really hairy.
•	The RPG elements bring personality to each of the characters, and each specialization feels powerful enough to warrant a diverse group of zombie survivors. Just be sure to keep everyone as happy as possible or they might leave at the worst possible moment!
•	The random events are both funny and enjoyable, with a bit of rage inducing as well to keep things nice and balanced towards a harder difficulty.
•	Local co-op makes for a great addition, but what is even better, playing alone is just as fun. The AI allies are not just mindless drones, they will loot, replace their weapons and crack zombie skulls with precision.
•	The production values are extremely high, visuals are top notch, music is fantastic, and the UX is streamlined and easy to navigate and use. The game also tends to throw useful events your way if you happen to be SOL in a particular resource.

Weaknesses:
•	The lack of an online or four player option makes me a sad panda.
•	The pendulum of “Doing Well” to “Dead Meat” can swing extremely quickly. One moment you are doing fine, and the next day you are left with nothing because the car broke down.

Overall Death Road to Canada is the survival game I didn’t even know I needed in my life. Sometimes after playing hundreds of hours in Project Zomboid or State of Decay, it is nice to just have a bit of fun smashing zombies, collecting loots, and driving towards the Maple Leaf State. I see myself playing this game for months in hopes to unlock all of the different modes and characters, easily the best fifteen dollars spent in a long while.

												Man, this is a fun game! 

It's got the right mood and the right style. It all fits together so well and it knows that it doesn't want to be taken too seriously. Its a great game if you want to play alone or with a friend. I also really like the character customization as well as the variety of other characters, traits, talents, and other things to spice up the game a bit.

There is one bit of criticism that I want to give. I kinda feel that the music can be a bit repetetive. I feel that adding a couple more tracks could really compliment with the replayability of the game and the desire of the people wanting those cheevos.

Despite that, I recommend this game. It's a great title if you want a quirky post-apocalyptic adventure."

												Started a run with myself and a friend. Recruited a dog in the first town. Dog distracted a bandit checkpoint so we could get past. Car broke down. Had the dog break through a zombie swarm and hotwire a sweet new fuel efficient ride. After the food ran out and morale fell through the floor, my friend kicked me out of the group and was subsequently chewed to death in an impossibly dense zombie siege. Dog barely escaped with its life. Game over because nobody was left to drive the car.

2/10, game is racist against dogs."

												A rouge with survival elements with a splash of internet humor. The game presents itself in two different play-styles: an Oregan Trail like decision making rpg overworld, and a Nuclear Throne like top down fighter where you scavenge for supplies and weapons. There is also a character customisation where you can design your own characters and give them particular traits to spice up the character, or you can find randomly generated characters to adenture with, topped with some preset special characters that have unique dialog, abilities and weapons. All of this is presented in beautiful and detailed pixel art.

I only have two gripes with DR2C,
-Its difficulty if the first. While I understand that it is a rougelike and your chances of winning consistantly without a high level of practice are very low. This game also heavily relies on good RNG on your characters stats and the events they are put in; which may turn people off. Generally I find there are two ways you can play DR2C, you either play silly in order to have fun, often resulting in bad things happening due to you telling everyone to ""COOL IT"", or you can play super optimally and boring, usually resulting in higher chances of victory but takes away some charm the game has.
-The second is the small amount of bugs the game has. So far my game is unable to enter fullscreen and just makes the screen black, which I assume is a resolution issue. The other problem that has only happened once is the game randomly crashing presenting you with an error code. However, being a newly released game with updates coming out every day, these problems are sure to be fixed if not shortly, in the future.

Overall DR2C is a great pick up game with runs lasting around 30-60 minutes, packed full with hilarious dialog and a vast array of characters. Good times will be had with this game, but if RNG reliant games bug you, you might want to wait till this title is on sale. If not, I highly recommend it!"

												Ever wanted to play as a dog and collect passangers? Wanted to drive the open road and get a demon dog as a friend? You and a friend can do that. You can collect a ton of unique weapons and travel the open road to CANADA! It's great fun. I suggest everyone to get it. It's a solid fun game and it's even just as entertaining when you're on your last stretch in the game. Seriously. Worth the $15. It's tons of random events and it really delivers it! Hilarious situations and silly companions."

												I can't say enough praise about this game, but not everything is flawless.

First and foremost, the music. I love the music and it's so happy and really brings out the emotion within this game, there is only a couple sad/intense songs which might drive certain people away from this game. Also to go along with the music is the pixel aesthetic. However, the pixel theme makes the characters very simple and their features become hard to distinguish. But the thing the game does beautifully with the art is backgrounds, the color and motion the scenery provides is nice to look at and really adds to the atmosphere.

Game play:
There's two sections of game play within Death Road to Canada: the action section and the Oregon Trail RNG Strategy DND Skill Checkin' Character Deathin' Road to the Maple Syrupy Hockey Land of Stereotypes Eh? section. The action phase consists of you and your party picking up whatever weaponry is lying around and bashing the brains out of some un-dead walking corpses, there is no special abilities or attacks but there is a stamina function. This stamina function limits you in a good way, because you can't swing(but you can shoot) wildly, forcing you to be smart about your attacks, also factored by the size of the hoard, and the location of the horde. During these action phases, you will be doing one of two things: looting or defending. Always Be Looting, your source of resources defined by your choice of location to go find the good stuff in. Then there is siege. I hate siege. A siege is where you are confined to a small area of map for an extended period of time left with whatever you find and what you have on you to fend against increasingly large hoards of zombabos- some of these are really, REALLY, difficult if you don't have a reasonable supply of bullets and guns.

On to the RNG aspect portion of the game. Your typical food and gas and such, but there is also a great system of morale. Morale is simple, it's how happy your party members are. Good morale will keep things running while bad morale will lead to run ending situations- keep your morale high by having enough supplies. I think the morale system is fair and not overly imposing so it adds a fun layer to the car ride to Canada. Along the road you will have to make several choices, and what may seem like the correct answer is not always the right answer. There are a lot of hard decisions that are designed to screw you over- unless you have a person with enough skill to get you out of that sticky situation. There are an assortment of skills and they each do different things, some carry over into the action portions while the others exist purely for the car portions- you will want to keep these up as they will get you out of ALOT of bad times. Other than that everything else is pretty cookie-cutter.

Now most of this game is great, but one thing this game does not do well is UI. The UI is very interrupting, as the only way to switch your party leader is via the pause menu in-game, which really takes away from that intense horde fight going on. Also ammo splitting is the most needed thing in the UI but it's not fully there, as in there is not a specific way to do this, and the current system is confusing. The UI looks nice enough but the functionality needs to be a lot better- there's no direct switching of items from party member to party member in the pre-mission gear assignment screen.
Hopefully this will get implemented however.

Overall if you are into rougelikes, this game is great for beginners and experienced fans of the genre looking for a greater challenge- some of the modes are ball-bustingly hard for all you masochists out there. Give it a shot and I'm sure you will love this game."

												I been playing this game on and off my stream for a couple days now. I been hosting races as well. I bought this game blindly over the simple fact that the name spoke to me, and I am glad I did. With me being a huge zombie fan and actually moving to Canada in a month I just had to get it. Every run I have of this game I am smiling, laughing, or genuinely worried.

Now let's talk about the game. It's very fun! Like Oregon Trail but with the action sequences reminding me of Gauntlet or any over the top action game. I never truly feel safe, which is a good thing. Anything can happen, for example, have a lot of food? Well sorry you had a hole in your bag. Doing okay on health? Feral cats attack. The humor and randomness make this game feel unique. The game is simple and easy to learn but hard enough that I failed every run thus far. I encountered a few issues here and there but nothing game breaking, I considered it apart of the adventure. 

When I first streamed this game my viewers loved it and a few purchased it. They been playing a lot and not one of them has anything really negative to say. So this review is technically coming from 7 or so people. Out of what I seen between us all, none of us have gotten further then day 1 remaining and the variety makes each trip special. We all made each other in the cute character creator and go on the adventure with another. It gives us stories and funny screen shots to share. We all love Death Road To Canada!

TL:DR I turned into a Dogataur would highly recommend! 10/10 Poutines."

												This game is one of the most fantastic games I have ever had the honour of playing.
             I first heard of this game via YouTube, on a channel called ""PBGGameplays"". I have wanted ever since, I believe it was ~3-ish months ago, and I had been meaning to get it for a while.

And then I did get it.

And it was even better than I had expected it to be.

             It is very replayable, due to the randomized everthing, and the sheer difficulty of it all. I have tried many times, (to seemingly no avail), to reach Caanada, but it is very difficult. Oh, that doesn't make it bad. It's not impossible; I know that, and I have gotten so close to victory once or twice before.
             The controls are great too. From someone who has no usb-connected controllers, even the keyboard is great to use. The local multiplayer is fun, and it's quite easy to play using only one keyboard. I can see it working with three, maybe four players. 
             This game is chalk-full of quirky jokes and clever references. It jokes around quite a bit, but knows when it's time to kick some serious zomble @ss. From the awesome car prompts, (such as ""Let's boogie!"" or ""Hit it!"") which, honestly aren't necessarily even jokes, just completely awesome, to the Buttsville police departments, this game is made of the essence of fun. 
              I love the style of it all, and the (I think) 32-bit graphics. And the music. Ooooh the music. I love it. I love all of the music. All of it. It's the kind of music that makes you want to get up and dance the zomble-filled night away. Well done.

               Anyways, this game is just awesome, great job to the dev(s) who made it. If I were to rate this game with a number, it would have to be an absolute ten... out of five. I absolutely love this game,.

                                                                               That is all."

												Let me tell you a story about a guy and a random dog he found in a ditch.

Girlymaaaaaaaaaan (Named after an akward time back in college when he looked like the Bootleg Michael Jackson) was driving to canada in his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hybrid car with 2 expendable ♥♥♥♥♥ in the trunk, then 1 day when they we´re driving like usual, a feral ♥♥♥♥ing mut replaces one of the expendable dudes.
After that the dog (now named Smith) does jackshit and lets his new comrades die. Then 1 fatal day when he let´s the last Humie (GIRLYMAAAAAAAAAAAN) die, he steals the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hybrid car and starts driving, shooting, trading, farting in the car and wandering who the hell did it even tough he´s the only being in the car.
Then one day smith desides to have a little humanity and help some dudes in a shootout and ends up being shot and killed.
R.I.P Smith the dog, a true deathroad survivor. PS. 10/10 whould leave Bootleg Michael Jackson die in a cottage again."

												Death Road To Canada is a randomly generated zombie survival road trip simulator with tough yet rewarding gameplay and hours upon hours of zombie slaughtering fun.

Story
Death Road To Canada follows two survivors of a zombie apocalypse as they try to make their way to the safe confines of the beautiful country of Canada. There is no specific story since the vibe of the game is almost a make-your-own adventure type and RNG does play a high role in the gameplay. Although there is no story as such, along the way you’ll meet new survivors and NPCs (if you stay alive long enough) and there is plenty of dialogue and little random events.

General Gameplay
When you start the game you’ll begin with a few supplies like food and medicine and your car (which is where a good chunk of your gameplay will be spent). You’ll travel in your car (or on foot if you happen to run out of gas or break your vehicle) and it’ll be from there you’ll encounter random events, traders, new locations, bandits and even sometimes new survivors to join your group. Travelling in your car will consume gas and travelling no matter how you do it will also consume food which is one of the most important resources. Without food your group will starve, the more they starve the lower their ‘morale’ drops and once a person's morale is completely gone it is highly likely they will abandon the group. The more group members you have the more manpower you wield but also you’ll consume more food so remember that when picking up new survivors.
Along your journey you’ll find various location that you’ll have the choice to loot if you wish too but you can also choose to pass them by. Sometimes you’ll find a solitary location and others you’ll find two to pick from and each location's name will be kinda relative to what you find at that location e.g supermarket = food, hardware store = melee weapons. Displayed alongside the location name will also be details of the location you’re about to enter such as the size of the zombie swarm, how aggressive they are and the time of day. These three things massively affect whether you’re successful at that location or not so you do have to take them into consideration when playing or you’ll quickly end up as zombie chow. Once you’ve assigned any weapons you may have to your survivors you can enter your location where you’ll be able to loot and kill at will. You’ll usually find a bit of loot and maybe an NPC, sometimes you’ll find something a little more rare. 
Each survivor has hidden stats which you won’t be able to see until they need to be used or you level them up for example you won't know if John is a good Mechanic until he tries to fix a car or increases that specific skill. Most survivors start pretty weak but the progression system in the game increases each trait that survivors randomly have as you complete specific things throughout your runs. 
My favourite part of Death Road To Canada is the ability to add all your friends/family/enemies/acquaintances to the game as survivors you’ll have a chance to meet along the way. You’re able to name them, choose what they look like and wear and their traits and then either load them into your game from the start as your starting survivors or hope to come across them randomly in normal gameplay. There is a mode that increases your chances of coming across custom survivors so if you want to play a game where you’re likely to find all your friends then you can. The Custom Game Mode isn’t the only game mode you’ll find though, there are several ranging from change in difficulty to change in your trip length so there are lots of options for replayability if you manage to beat the normal main campaign (good luck).

Sound and Graphics
The graphics are pixel graphics and though I do enjoy the ‘old-school’ feel to them sometimes I have trouble seeing some things clearly, especially the larger the screen I play it on. 
The soundtrack is truly fantastic though! Instead of what you’d expect of a normal zombie survival game it takes an upbeat approach instead and the juxtaposition is fantastic. The whole package has a very nice retro feel to it and brings back some nostalgic feelings of the games on older consoles.

Pros
--- Randomized events, survivors and locations for replayability.
--- Local Co-Op so your friends can help you smash some zombies.
--- Fantastic soundtrack.
--- Difficult yet rewarding gameplay.
--- Customizability with survivors you can create yourself to encounter when you play. 
--- Various game modes
--- Awesome soundtrack (yet not available for purchase )-: )
---GNOMEY.

Cons
--- Full controller support yet instructions are keyboard keys only.
--- No achievements?!?!?!?!
--- Sieges can be a real pain in the...foot. Some are just a little too difficult.

Summary
Death Road To Canada to put it plainly is a great game with a hell of a lot of fun to be had. The randomization and various game-modes adds a great deal of replayability and the fact you can customize the game and add your own characters gives it a great feel. There's plenty of content included and for the hours of gameplay you’ll get out of it the price is more than fair. If you’re not willing to part with the cash right now it’s still a must buy during one of the Steam sales."

												Me and my buddy got a dog named easton by giving him food.
We sent him to the camp of some strangers to look cute and make sure we would get in, but he farted everywhere and got us kicked out.
After a few other adventures, he went crazy, killed my buddy, and ran away in the woods because he was ashamed killing his friend.
I miss him."

												Awesome zombie roadtrip/survival RPG game.
Great artwork, music and sound effects.

The game really has style and a unique flavour of its own.

Much of the trailer video is later on in the game and it starts off mellow and cranks up, which i was glad about.
I thought you were thrown in straight away with 500 odd zombie on you lol.

Random generated worlds each playthrough makes for unlimited replayability."

												So you think you can make it to Canada eh? Think you're high and mighty, capable of waltzing through the undead hordes with both skill and style? Well how about you COOL IT! and take a seat right there, cause getting to Canada ain't no picnic!

I've tried reaching Canada several times now; some tries more successful than others. From times where there was plenty of food, but where health slowly ticked away after every encounter. To times where I had plenty of health yet my group slowly died of hunger.

No this ain't Canada, it's the US of A; where the zombie virus affect both man and machine. Because cars seem to fail after ten miles and aluminum bats SNAP! at the speed of sound. As if God himself stacked the odds against you! And I'm not even mentioning the SIEGE!s.

Don't be fooled, this is a hard game, and when you play it long enough you will become familiar with these two words: Dang it!

Pros:
-Highly enjoyable if you have a slightly wacky (and maybe even macabre) sense of humor.
-Plain old enjoyable if you don't.
-Quite hard, (though at times luck based.)
-Very active devs, seriously. (As of writing; working actively to fix some bugs that snuck in release)

Cons:
-(Quite hard, though) at times luck based.
-Some weaponry breaks way too fast/randomly. In one of my new games; a character broke their starting weapon after one hit.

In short:
Personally love it; would get into a car made of aluminum foil, tell random people to COOL IT!, and get eaten while trying to drive to Canada again."

												Death Road to canada, a very hard yet enjoyable game. Hard because of how one second you have a full team where everyone is super good, but then when you get to a trader camp, have no food left, so then you steal some food from a trader, and then the whole camp kills everyone except your weak healer ;-;. Enjoyable because you could come a cross a very free horse man..... who cant wield any wepons so when your whole team dies excpet for him you basically are dead, which goes back to the hard thing XD. but there is a lot of replayability because of how everyone you meat on the road has random stats. There was this one time when i had a dog (o btw the dogs can talk and carry wepons XD) and she found a empty mascot suit that came to life and yelled ""I HATE MONDAYS!"", so then we did anything that a normal human would do, we recruted him to our group. But then things went wrong, one day while we were driving the suit just yell ""I HATE MONDAYS!"" and then he said ""AND TODAY IS A MONDAY"". then he teleported us all into a seige in a random set of woods and 2 of my people died, including my dog ;-;(just kidding it deserved it she was a jerk >:( ). so ya that is how i lost that game. But back to the actual review even with all of this fun stuff that i just talked about there are some cons one being the multiplayer, the second player has to each and everytime you go somewhere select the charrecter they want to play and join the fight which is realy tedious. Secondly the second player cannot go through doors which means, the first player has the infamous main charrecter deseas (but to a lower extent because they can die and the story goes on), this makes going through a house really annoying because the first player has to do everything. All in all this is a great game and i recomend it. And also the naked horse man is the most majestic thing i have seen in my life. :3"

												Got it as a gift from a friend. Cute game, lots of really cute and good ideas, but the gameplay is so frustratingly simple and the rng is stacked against you that it just becomes a slog to play through. You could be having a great time and then suddenly it throws at you a 2 hour long (ingame) seige with the worst settings, trapping you inside a tiny room with hundreds of zombies you can't do anything about. There is literally nothing you can do other than die in most cases. You can't even aim with your guns properly, even if your stats are high with it, because of the way the controls work. The game also goes for way too long for one default run so you'll be sitting there bashing your keyboard/game controller trying to start your car until your hands cramp.

I wouldn't recommend it personally, but can definitely see the appeal and you may get more mileage out of it than I did."

												This earns a seat next other magnificent indie retro games like ""Party Hard"" and ""Rouge Legacy"". But in a lot of ways this is technically better then both. Having multiple modes to choose from to fit your play style or your time frame and even for your experience. Adding in a reasonable character customization that can tailor your leader/potential traveling company personality and look. You can make any one from a basic solder to a YouTube celebrity like Jim Sterling. The coolest feature is one that we are starting to see less and less of in the AAA gaming industry, couch co-op. My only gripe is that it could use some mod support for players to add to this already incredible game.

I play consoles more often than not. But when I get that retro, nostalgia itch or an experience that I just can’t find on consoles, I go to steam. And my goodness this's a treasure. I give this a 9/10.

A most have on Steam."

												Death road to Canada is such a fantastic game and it has so many hilarious and surprising moments. The Goal of this game is to get to Canada while driving with a bunch of jerks and trying
to keep your face from being eaten off ;) .Since this game is pretty difficult and will probably take a few tries before you get to Canada, but when you do, it is so satisfying. Probably the most satsifying thing that i have ever done (now that i think about it, that sounds really sad). Overall its a really fun game and had some good laughs. Highly recommend getting this game. :)

Pros:
-Fun gameplay
-Different modes to keep things intresting
-As tough as old boots
-Great music
-The pixel art style is amazing (love all the small details)
-Lots of trial and error
-pretty good character customisation

Cons:
-Sometimes it can be a bit unfair

10/10 would play this again
and again
and again
:P"

												 On the Death Road, Casey the Surgeon and Spelunky Guy the Explorer were traveling in their car they had obtained after helping an alien fight a siege of zombies.

Along with their Bodybuilder friend, they travel along almost reaching New York. Until they are stopped after they learn the D*A*N*G*E*R   R*A*N*G*E*R*S, and the unfortunate situation they had gotten themselves into to.

After saving them and being blessed by Blue's pep talk, Green's swole tips, Orange's fitness training, and Pink healing wisdom; they found Vinny from Vinesauce, along with a gnome they found on the side of the road.

In a unfortunate siege, Bodybuilder, Vinny, and Gnome all bit the dust.

Without Spelunky Guy, which they booted out earlier, Casey traveled along the edge of New York almost to the border of Canada...

With chainsaw, pistol, and hatchet in hand; she prepared for the next 4 hour siege that would decide her fate...

Until she got stung and killed by a bee which flew into the car, after telling the bee, her final last words...










COOL IT!!!"

												This game is one of the most fantastic games I have ever had the honour of playing.
             I first heard of this game via YouTube, on a channel called ""PBGGameplays"". I have wanted ever since, I believe it was ~3-ish months ago, and I had been meaning to get it for a while.

And then I did get it.

And it was even better than I had expected it to be.

             It is very replayable, due to the randomized everthing, and the sheer difficulty of it all. I have tried many times, (to seemingly no avail), to reach Caanada, but it is very difficult. Oh, that doesn't make it bad. It's not impossible; I know that, and I have gotten so close to victory once or twice before.
             The controls are great too. From someone who has no usb-connected controllers, even the keyboard is great to use. The local multiplayer is fun, and it's quite easy to play using only one keyboard. I can see it working with three, maybe four players. 
             This game is chalk-full of quirky jokes and clever references. It jokes around quite a bit, but knows when it's time to kick some serious zomble @ss. From the awesome car prompts, (such as ""Let's boogie!"" or ""Hit it!"") which, honestly aren't necessarily even jokes, just completely awesome, to the Buttsville police departments, this game is made of the essence of fun. 
              I love the style of it all, and the (I think) 32-bit graphics. And the music. Ooooh the music. I love it. I love all of the music. All of it. It's the kind of music that makes you want to get up and dance the zomble-filled night away. Well done.

               Anyways, this game is just awesome, great job to the dev(s) who made it. If I were to rate this game with a number, it would have to be an absolute ten... out of five. I absolutely love this game,.

                                                                               That is all."

After almost 30 hours, I have not yet made it to Canada (Yes, there is quite a bit of RNG involved in this game - some of it ironic, most of it malicious, a lot of it intentional) but I do not care because the game is AMAZING! And I already live in Canada IRL.

10/10 will recreate my friends just to watch them die again. And again. And again."

												I just came out of my best run at this game yet. Me and my motley crew had a hybrid which took us up to 7 days out from Canada. Sadly we broke down and while walking in the woods we stumbled across an alien. And his alien car! With the promise of getting this car after the seige we fought. My team scraped through and once we had been told how to open the car we fought through uncountable waves of undead to reach this strange, grey vehicle. We leapt in and slammed the doors, revving the engine, preparing to shoot off into the sunset. Then the car exploded and we both died. 
This game is amazing. The style is really fun, the music is quirky and charming and the humor is on point. Definately worth the £10!"

I love the art style and unsubtle referential humour.
The sequence of events is in constant flux and all character perks feel useful in at least some situations.
Great co-op gameplay for two people and I feel like it could be ported to console for 4 player couch co-op (something lacking in todays market)

Would recommend to people who like to laugh and experience those moments of terror when you're surrounded on all sides, your out of bullets and that 2x4 just broke as you're friend was devoured before your eyes....

												This game is so much fun but it  could be like 50 % better if it hadnt such devestating RNG ...... i had 2 survivors with maxed out mechanic skill and i repaired my car 2 times with no problems. i was 2 driving days away from canada and i wanted to loot 1 final building. when i arrive at the mission, all my characters get out of the car when suddenly, completely out of nowhere, my car explodes !!! the explosion killed 3 out of 4 survivors leaving the leader in a humongous group of zombies with only a sledgehammer and a rifle (sledgehammer is one of the slowest weapons in the game and the rifle i had was a not auto at all ....). you can probably make out what happened next.... I got killed in seconds and i had 0 chance of getting out ! I can deal with randomness to a certain degree but when i have a perfect run and my almost guaranteed win gets taken away by something so ridiculous, i just cant take it serious anymore ! but all rng besides, i really enjoy the game and its pretty easy to spend hours on it. also you can make your own characters ( the left 4 dead crews fit perfectly) and meet them on the Death Road to Canada !"

												My group of ragtag misfits had made it all the way to Canadian border until the party's bruiser had gotten the smart idea to throw molotovs at the approaching wall of zombies.  Shortly after this he realized his mistake as the conflagrating waves of undead set fire to not only himself but his other friends, including a luchador who spent his last breath piledriving a zombie into the hostile crowds.  

As all four friends lay burning in the snow like the Earth immolating at the edge of a supernova, their last sight on this cursed world was that of a giant mech dressed as a Canadian Mountie singing, ""O' Canada"""

												I have waited for this game for about three years, and let me tell you that it has not disappointed me one bit. From meeting the main character of Don't Sh*t Yourself to having a car full of dogs (and when one was left it drove along the road), I can absoluely recommend this game to anyone that likes randomly generated dungeon crawler-esque games.
PS. You can always trust dogs. Unless they wear trench coats."

												Wow what a ride!!

Death Road to Canada is a real riot. I played local co-op with my wife and we both had a lot of fun! Very humorous Oregon Trail style game blended with some hack-n-slash action, with a bit of randomness thrown in for good measure.

Essentially, you are managing a group as they try to go from Florida to Canada. You manage supplies such as fuel, food, and different melee weapons and guns. There are choose-your-own-path events that pop up frequently. You sometimes will die VERY quickly from a random event, but its all good. The storyline is created as you go, and seems really great with each run.

Definately one of the highlights in this game is the ability to create custom characters, and save them so they pop up on future runs. I play myself, and my wife plays her in-game self. We put our friends in there. We choose their skill sets and how they look. It really makes the 'story' aspect so much more great.

Pros:
+Great blend of Oregon Trail and hack-n-slash gameplay
+Controller support makes this great to play from the couch
+The humor is spot-on and makes for really funny storylines that definately feel very unique each time you play
+The ability to create and save custom characters is awesome
+RPG-esque leveling up of skills really adds a layer of strategy

Cons:
-The music is pretty good, but is a bit 'lite' or 'wonky' for the game (this is hard to describe)
-I don't know if its just us, but the controller is a bit awkward in the menus (not during gameplay, though) - it feels like it is cutting out, but it is definately not a battery thing or connection since I checked
-You will have a few random deaths that feel cheap, but really its all fun and gave us good laughs

Definately an outstanding local co-op game. It is still fun single-player, but shines when playing with a friend. Overall, I could see us getting a lot of hours out of this one."

												ROADTRIIIIIIIIIIIIP!

EVERYONE NEEDS THIS GAME

Seriously though I have no idea why this isn't a more popular game, it's so amazing, it's one of the best roguelites I've played to this day. Comedy, difficulty, amazing music, and everything else. This game is a game I can see myself sinking multiple hours into, I have 10.5 hours into it already and I only bought it like 5 days ago, not much until you realize I've only spent like the last 2 of those 5 days playing games, and I was still busy as hell. This game really really needs to be noticed more, because it's an absolute gem amongst indie games.

Oh, and also always remember, cool it."

												What is Death Road to Canada?
Death Road to Canada is as the developers succinctly describe it in the Steam description, a 'randomly generated road trip simulator.' The game would also be considered to be a randomly generated zombie killing machine. The aim of the game is to lead you and acquaintances you meet along the way from Florida to Canada. This is because you have heard that Canada has been spared from the zombie apocalypse. However, as they say its the journey and not the destination that is the aim of the game.

Before I Begin
I have had a great time reading many of the reviews that have been contributed to Steam. This is the perfect game for sharing individual experiences. As a result, I can see fan fiction becoming an enormous part of the game's community. Therefore, kudos for this not only goes to the community members for creating this wonderful content but also to the developers for designing a game perfect and worthy of it. It is truly a testimony to the quality of the final product.

Learn As You Go
The tutorial teaches you the bare minimum. For some this may be a concern but it shouldn't be. I have found that some of the best games only teach the basic mechanics needed to play. The rest is left to the player experience. If you put the time into the game you will continue to learn each time you play. This is a very good thing. This is because some of the tricks I have learned wouldn't have meant as much had they been in the tutorial and had I not learned them by myself. Some of the magic of the playing is in the learning. Therefore, the game demands that you learn more as you progress. Consequently, you may die a few times but you need to mark these down as learning experiences.

Challenging...
To continue with the 'learning as you go' mantra of the game it must be acknowledged that it is very challenging. For starters, the zombie AI - as stupid as zombies may seem - can be quite tough. They can swarm and they can, and will, overwhelm you. Therefore you must remain alert and vigilant at all times. You must consider if you are outnumbered and if so what your best avenue of self defense and preservation is.

Weapons can and do break. You will run out of ammunition. However, you can hold multiple weapons at any one time. It is best policy to remember the strengths and weaknesses of your characters. This is most noteworthy because the weapons that you choose to wield - when you find them - can make the game easier. There's nothing better than having the ability to go to town against a swarm and defeating them all.

If there is one potential weakness of the game its in the fact that the difficulty can spike unpredictably. However, there is a valid argument that this adds realism to the game. There is never going to be any scenario that is exactly as it seems. Swarms can occur at random intervals. As a result of this randomness some of these spikes can lead to frustrating deaths.

... To the point of being Unforgiving
Generally, the game is unforgiving. Once you screw up there is very little chance for your survival. As a result of this the game is definitely one that has the potential to induce rage. An example of this rage came in my second unsuccessful attempt. I had successfully cleared a building and wanted to move on with the game. Therefore, I raced outside with my trio of seemingly hardened warriors into a swarm of the undead. I jumped in my car but of course I couldn't drive away because the vehicle was swarmed. They not only damaged the vehicle but proceeded to annihilate all of us. I could do nothing but watch in sheer terror.

Randomly Generated Adventuring
One of the best features of the game is the way in which it is randomly generated. Stories and settings for individual segments of the game are randomly generated. However, they are based somewhat from the options you are provided with.

In one of my segments I visited a city and was given the choice of whether or not I wanted to visit a sports store or a house with a HELP sign. As this was early on in the game and I was only with my initial buddy I chose to go to the HELP house. I took my chances that the house would have somebody still alive that would be willing to join my team. Although I bet the sports store probably had a nicer selection of weapons and equipment that I could pick up. This strategy was of the hope that the numbers game would help more than a randomized weapon. I was proven to be correct. I acquired the extra party member and was able to adventure on.

In conclusion, the events are random. This is especially relevant considering the entirety of the game is played out within these little settings. However, it leads me to the next segment of the game that is worth noting and that is the game's buddy system.

The Buddy System
This is one of my favorite features in the game. Hidden within the fun thrilled violence is a message about camraderie and the meaning of taking a road trip together. You have a choice at the beginning of the game whether or not you want to start with an ally. I would suggest that if you are a beginner that you do have one. If you have a second player with you then they can play the role. If not, then the computer will control them for you. Because the game has been well designed the AI does a reasonable job hacking enemies up for you.

Each ally comes with their own unique characteristics and skills that can add value to your team. Although beggars can rarely be choosers you may want to consider what type of characters you align yourself with. They can stay with you until they either die or they betray you. That's right, they can betray you. That in itself is a fascinating mechanic. If they do betray you then its game over. It's best to keep their morale high - through successful completion of events and stories - although I am uncertain as to whether or not this increases the likelihood of betrayal. I assume that it would.

Custom Characters
A great feature of the game is that you can create a number of custom characters. You can choose to play this character and/or have one as your buddy. If you choose not to do this then they can and will pop up throughout the game. It is at this turn that you can add them as allies.

Risk/Reward and Resource Management
There is a risk/reward system at play in the combination of stories/events and allies. Events will pop up throughout the game that provide you with an opportunity to utilize their abilities. If they are successful then you can increase your stockpile sometimes dramatically. However, failure in any of these events can see a crucial member of your unit die. As a result you will need to carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of your character, your current predicament and determine whether or not the potential reward is worth it. Given the unforgiving nature of the game each decision is significant.

With that said an underappreciated part of the game is in its resource management. Players must consider how many rations, medical supplies, fuel, etc. that they have at their disposal. Players must therefore weigh up the pros and cons of adding an ally. If you are running dangerously low on resources then adding a member to your team may not be the most sage of things to do.

As a result of the total combined randomness you are guaranteed a unique playthrough every time you play."

												I've been following Rocketcat Games for years now, since their early iOS days...
While I had been thoroughly disappointed in that they weren't making games for PC, I was thrilled when the kickstarter released for this game.

Sadly, I didn't have the funds to back it at the time, although it's great to see a kickstarter game that actually gets finished.

The game is really great. It's tough, like every rogue-like Rocketcat game.
Randomness sometimes doesn't seem too random, seems to give dull loot and dull character encounters. Especially when you modify the save files and find out what in all is actuall IN this game.

In the end, I wish there was more to the game, but I am still very satisfied with my purchase. The devs seem to be continuously adding. Highly recommend this game."

												To sum up this game... hummm.  You will die because you open a van door and hot sauce flows out and burns you. You fail to shoot the lock off twinky truck with a shotgun. You fall out of trees, You do massive jumps over huge ledges, you survive massive amounts of zombies through grit and determination, then you die because you swatted a bee. You decide to turn on Rare characters so you can then  repeat the process with Octodad, Link, and Jason Vorheez. then you die because your car broke down and you got attacked like half a million times before finding another one. You then decide to try something new with custom characters of your wife/husband son/daughter father and mother and then you get to see them die because they failed to do hard core parkour, they couldn't putt enough gold balls at the zombies, and because the game was cruel and gave you a sardine packed mega cheezed hour long siege, Aka lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off zombies."

												Let me tell you a story about a guy and a random dog he found in a ditch.

Girlymaaaaaaaaaan (Named after an akward time back in college when he looked like the Bootleg Michael Jackson) was driving to canada in his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hybrid car with 2 expendable ♥♥♥♥♥ in the trunk, then 1 day when they we´re driving like usual, a feral ♥♥♥♥ing mut replaces one of the expendable dudes.
After that the dog (now named Smith) does jackshit and lets his new comrades die. Then 1 fatal day when he let´s the last Humie (GIRLYMAAAAAAAAAAAN) die, he steals the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hybrid car and starts driving, shooting, trading, farting in the car and wandering who the hell did it even tough he´s the only being in the car.
Then one day smith desides to have a little humanity and help some dudes in a shootout and ends up being shot and killed.

												Started off with Genji and Tasha things were going smooth on our quest to Canada and along the way to Canada we met Billy. He was a fisherman with immense shooting skills but with a kind heart. He gave us some catfish when we were running low on food and helped us on our seige when we were sandwiched by zombies. Unfortunately the bandits came and   Billy sacrificed himself for us to move on. Next we stumble upon Ninja and took her in our team. Things were not doing well as our morale decreased and Tasha being the b*** that she is, wanted to boot Genji out of the team. Genji leaves and we went on and eventually  Tasha went through a votex and became Ahsat met Artsy on the way. Upon recruiting Artsy, Ninja just threw a smoke bomb and basically ditched the team. Things were going solid as a two man team and eventually we met Gnomey. Gnomey had a short time with us since he protected us from the bandits that tried to steal our food and supplies. We went onward and we met Snoop Dog. He was a nice guy sang songs for us and boosted the morale. We went to raid a supermarket packed with zombies and Snoop Dog being the gangster that he is shooted the zombies like theres no tomorrow. Unfortunately Snoop Dog got caught by the zombie horde and became food for the zombies. With just a few days away from Canada the team happened to stumble upon Ramboux. We paid 10 food to him to be in our team unfortunately he died right after we got him since he was unable to ride the car. As our journey to Canada almost comes to end we were getting worried that we do not have enough man power to do the last fight to Canada. Fortunate enough we saw Fatty Tuna the nerd and got him along with some medical supplies. Along the way we saw a HELP banner and paved our way through the zombies to recruit the last man in our team which was Kelp. We went on a seige for 4 hours and went through the Canadian boarder, fended off the last set of zombies and eventually we got into Canada with the Prime minister welcoming our team with open arms."

												I played this game when it came out, and was on the fence about it. Since then, it's had a lot of patches, re-balances, and content updates, and they've made the game much more fun. Ammo is a little more plentiful, weapons last a little longer, it's easier to gain momentum as you go. There are higher difficulties for those who want it, but normal no longer feels arbitratily punishing.

Further, I had a man get too sad to continue on the Death Road, and so he trained the dog that was his only companion to drive and told him to go and make him proud. Shotgun-wielding dog then made it to Canada.

A+. 5/5. Jasper is the best dog."

The only few problems I have with it are: there is no 4 player multiplayer, sometimes the cpu helping you will just stand there, and no online multiplayer but that is it. This game has to be one of the better games i have played in a while. The best way to play it though is to make friends then play familiar people mode.

												(Disclaimer : Review key recieved from developer)

The Death Road to Canada... or as I like to call it : ""The Happiest Zombie Apocalypse in America""
Bored of those gritty zombie games where you're stuck with relentless brown and green? Tired of those endless drudges through gore and misery only to wind up going from day to day rooting out tins of cold baked beans? Sick and tired of having to scavenge hundreds of planks to make fences for your little survivor camp? Hacked off at seeing the same identikit survivors which stories which all blend into each other and just make you reach for the booze?

Fret no longer, for I present the Happiest Zombie Apocalypse in America

Death Road to Canada is possibly one of the most lighthearted zombie murder games I've run into in a long while, ostensibly taking it's inspiration from the Organ Trail, and FTL, you're put in charge of two survivors, and a car. Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to drive to Canada, or to die trying. Hint, you're going to die a fair few times before you get there, but that's all part of the learning experience. You can either take some random survivors in a default game setting, or you can create your own survivors, be they friends or people you want to see turned into zombie chow, and set off with your own choice of team, with the intent of picking up more friends along the way.

Combat is a little bit loose, but that's intended by design, you are after all, survivors, not trained soldiers, so you tend to waff your melee weapons in the general direction of whatever is closest to you, said weapons ranging from spatulas (no, no joke) right the way through to sledgehammers, hockeysticks, nailboards, and baseball bats. Then you've the proper shootybang stuff with revolvers, pistols, shotguns and so on. The stats of your survivor play a significant part in how many swings they'll get in before they become ""winded"", or in the case of firearms, just how accurate they're prone to be (shotguns you can get away with giving to anyone, other guns you'll want to be a bit more careful with).

DRtC has strong DNA, with a lot of content and a strong level of depth involved
For what could have been a fairly simple pick up and play game, there's a lot of statistical complexity under the hood, with weapons having their own ""drain"" on player stamina, weapons having their own fire rate, accuracy and spread, and vehicles having their own consumption rate, and durability. Characters too have their own personality traits and benefits, meaning that it's unlikely you'll run across two survivors that are exactly the same in a given playthrough, as a direct result, DRtC becomes a far stronger game than the Organ Trail and actually elevates itself up to the company of games like Death Skid Marks, which shares the same kind of irreverant humour and sense of fun about it.

This doesn't even touch on the fact there's pets you can bring into the team (Dogs and Cats, though as yet I've not been successful at grabbing either), there's choose your own adventure style events, though these are more simplistic than say, FTL, they are stat based in terms of the choices you get with differing chances of success, and depending on your survivors, you may get presented with different options from one playthrough to the next.

Closing thoughts
Death Road to Canada -could- have been a throwaway title, or something that would have been fun for a pick up and play but ultimately not something that would stand up to repeated scrutiny. I'm glad to report that this definitely is not the case, there's real longevity here, and there's a definite gem of a game here. One that has managed to emerge as another Kickstarter success (which is a bit of a rarity these days) and one the devs rightly should be quite happy about.

Verdict : Highly recommended, with one caveat which I'll discuss below. 

However, I do not feel that it significantly detracts from the game itself as this is a single player experience, 

it would be nice to see it resolved somewhen though.

There -is- one unanswered question which I'll update my review with as time progresses, and that concerns a KS exclusive piece of content which whilst not *vast*, is game affecting. As is normal for any review I do, I do ""due dilligence"" on all games that go through Kickstarter, and I highlight such things because in the interests of being thorough, that's my job. 

One of the reward tiers ($50) provided backers with a specific game unlock, allowing them to have the option of a kitten or puppy as a ""morale booster"" who would grow into a full team member over time, at the cost of an additional food drain. This would be something in the -longer term- I'd like to see added as purchasable DLC of some sort, as it would be nice to have the full game made ""content complete"", however, as I state above, because this game is predominantly a singleplayer experience, this isn't something that will affect players beyond their personal preference.

This element will be removed or revised as more information is made available."

												True story...

Added my brother into the game as a custom character. He gets picked up by a party of three. They then all encounter a siege and all but my brother (named Dead Man) die. Next loot phase, he finds a machine, which I have him enter. He comes out with stat boosts and is now a dog. He manages to finish that loot phase without dying.

Game indicates everyone is dead... but wait, there's still a dog. My brother turned dog then focuses on going to Canada and proceeds to DRIVE THE CAR.

Next, we encounter bandits. Bandits let brother pass because, oh, he's just a dog.

He then proceeds to pick up a person before coming across a cabin with a chainsaw, which he proceeds to pick up (being I'm controlling him) and starts killing zombies with a chainsaw while walking on his hind legs.

If this wasn't enough, the next loot phase, he finds a blowtorch and lights himself on fire by accident, killing himself.

I have never laughed this hard playing a game.

												I added me and my wife as custom characters. We came across a dog holed up in an appartment building and recruited him onto our team. A few miles down the road my wife and the dog proceed to have an arguement and she made me choose between her and the dog. 

This was the hardest choice I've ever made in my entire life.

Then I recruited Lank from the Lagand of Zalda and sold his soul to a demon."

												This game is so much fun but it  could be like 50 % better if it hadnt such devestating RNG ...... i had 2 survivors with maxed out mechanic skill and i repaired my car 2 times with no problems. i was 2 driving days away from canada and i wanted to loot 1 final building. when i arrive at the mission, all my characters get out of the car when suddenly, completely out of nowhere, my car explodes !!! the explosion killed 3 out of 4 survivors leaving the leader in a humongous group of zombies with only a sledgehammer and a rifle (sledgehammer is one of the slowest weapons in the game and the rifle i had was a not auto at all ....). you can probably make out what happened next.... I got killed in seconds and i had 0 chance of getting out ! I can deal with randomness to a certain degree but when i have a perfect run and my almost guaranteed win gets taken away by something so ridiculous, i just cant take it serious anymore ! but all rng besides, i really enjoy the game and its pretty easy to spend hours on it. also you can make your own characters ( the left 4 dead crews fit perfectly) and meet them on the Death Road to Canada !"

												This is based off of a true story.

Everything was fine. Kiara, Rosaline, and their dog, Billy, were cruising down the Death Road to Canada. They had over 200 gas, over 30 food, 20 medical kits, and more ammo and weapons than they know what to do with. They were a happy family, eating marshmallows and telling scary stories around the fire.
Then... everything changed when the group of bandits attacked.
Kiara was killed. But that wasn't the worst part. The dog was killed. Sweet little Billy. Struck down in his prime. Rosaline was all alone.
So she traveled on. The car broke down. She walked alone, through the rain. She didn't have time to mourn the lost of her dearest friends... her only friends. Then, when all hope was gone, while looting an apartment, Rosaline found a dog, Jeanette. She adopted Jeanette and they traveled onwards.
The two comrades happened upon a junkyard that had a decent car. At the junkyard was another dog that joined them in their new car. Jeanin was one of them now. Their family was growing. They were all smiles and laughs. Jeanette loved to stick her fluffy doggy head out the window.
And another dog, Virginia, found them on the road and joined them! Rosalin was surrounded by sweet, loving, zombie-killing dogs. What more could she ask for?
But one apartment... there were too many zombies. Rosalin was seperated from her beloved dog. She slashed at the rotting zombies with her rusty machete but she was too tired. Her arms went limp at her side as she felt teeth rip into her flesh. She looked at Jeanette one last time... her last breath was a single, whispering word:
""Canada.""
The fluffy little dog gathered up her friends, her comrades, her family, and fled the apartment, leaving behind the skeleton of her beloved master. With that one word echoing in her mind, Jeanette jumped in the front seat of the car and taught herself to drive. They were going to get to Canada.
The three dogs fought and fought for over a week. They battled their ways through sieges, through swarms, through factories, through grocery stores, through the skeletons of the hundreds of humans who had died in their journey to Canada. So many had died. But these little dogs were making it.
They were less than two days away. They stopped at a trading camp one last time. The traders took pity on the three dogs and gave them some free ammo. The dogs were eterneally grateful.
But Rosalin had had all the guns.
The dogs didn't have any guns.
One last stop before reaching Canada.
They were trapped in a house.
It was a siege. They just had to survive long enough and then escape.
Zomies were raining from the ceilings, flooding through the door as a flood of death and gore. No other human had ever gotten this far before. Not even close. But these dogs. These brave dogs, Jeanette, Jeanin, Virginia... they had done what no other human had done. They had gotten to Canada.
Almost.
Jeanette was the first to die as she desperately tried to lead the pack of zombies away from her comrades and from the door which would soon be open. But the house was too small. She was overwhelmed.
Jeanin took over. Sweet little Virginia was being overwhelmed. Jeanin ran in, batting the zombie away, scratching and biting them to protect Virginia, who was quickly becoming tired. Jeanin succeeded in her goal, but only after she died.
Virginia. She was all alone. The zombies were busy feasting upon the carcasses of Jeanette and Jeanin. Virginia ran towards the door. The siege wasn't over but it was almost time for that blessed door to be free. She would be ready.
But the zombies were far more ready than she was.
They were waiting right outside the door and came rushing in to greet her. Virginia fought her way to the door and tried to leave.
""It is unsafe to go outside right now.""
She couldn't leave. Not yet. She tried to run away. She fought and fought and fought... but it was all for naught. She was less than a foot away from the exit.
The zombies circled her and Virginia's body fell to the floor as they bit and scratched her. Her blood was ripped out from her veins and her limbs were devoured by the growling mass of zombies. As her soul slowly left her eyes, she could see one last sign...
""The siege is over. It's safe to go outside.""
One day away.
One driving day away from Canada.
Almost.

10/10 would get a pack of dogs to drive a car to Canada again."

												It started out as an adventure of my friend, Nic, and I to Canada. We've known each other since we were small. Together we survived some pretty prickly situations and we met a few friends along the way, Rusty and Jacinda. 

We were a rag tag group of survivors content on the idea of making it to Canada. Things were looking great but unfortunately that didn't last long. We had lost our car and were forced to trek on foot. 

After what seemed to be an eternity, we spotted a cabin and a van that resembled a dog. After fighting through the horde of zombies, we managed to find the keys. We struggled to make it back to the van, but we were on our way to Canada once again!

We all were in need of rest after the all the excitement we had endured during the day so we had found an empty house along the roadside. Night was falling upon us, as leader, I appointed Jacinda to barricade duty. This was a fatal decision on my part as leader. I may not have been perfect but I always seemed to keep us on top. Night had fallen and we were surrounded by zombies. With Jacinda's lackluster job, they had been able to break in and we had lost Nic and Rusty. Jacinda and I had narrowly escaped with our lives. 

Bitter towards Jacinda, I knew ultimately it was my decision which had led to the death of my childhood friend, Nic, and our beloved teammate, Rusty. Even after these events, we couldn't forget our initial goal of this journey. It was to make it to Canada. The sacrifice of our friend's could not be in vain. Once again, we pushed on.

Low on supplies and down to just the two of us, we decided to enter a nearby town to gear up. The rain helped muffle our sounds enough to push past the large packs of angry and aggressive zombies. We found a house with enough supplies to last us the remainder of our trip. Now we just needed to get back to our van.

On our way out the door, we noticed the large packs had moved to the outside of the house we were in, and sadly, we were spotted. We had tried to stand our ground, but were quickly overwhelmed and were forced to run. Making a mad dash to our van, we had gotten ourselves surrounded. 

It was in that moment that Jacinda had taken her hatchet and started fighting and pushing her way through one side. Myself and a bloody and beaten Jacinda had managed to make it to the doorway of a small house. She was bitten all over and we both knew that it was over for her. She told me to go inside without her. She said she was sorry but this is where her story ends. Reluctantly, I turned and closed the door.

Here I sit in this small house, alone and waiting for my impending doom while I write this letter. Moans and sounds of limbs banging against the door. I feel at peace.

10/10 Simulator for when 'murica falls because of the Trumpster. Would die travelling to Canada again."

Then the three immediatly find Tommy Wiseau in a haunted house
They raid an arcade, and spend the next few hours there.
They raid yall mart and a furniture store.
At the furniture store, the muscle car will not start and they are forced to abandon the sweet blue car.
The weather is horrid. They lose morale
They find a miserably long load and lose morale
They think they see a car that might work
Duke and Danica die, at the same moment, both barfing after being killed by zombies
Bill Nye is the new leader
Bill Nye is killed seconds later, barfing, after being killed by zombies
Tommy Wiseau is the new leader

												Played Organ Trail? It's an excellent redo of the old Oregon Trail, except Zombie-themed. I love the game, it's interesting and dark and grim in a beautiful way. Highly recommended.

Now strip away the dark and grim, overcaffeinate it, jack it up with that unique style of methamphetamine crazy, and add an uptempo soundtrack, and you get Death Road to Canada. Even more recommended.

This lovely little thing has had me drop multiple other triple-A games I'd been playing to focus here almost exclusively. I have yet to successfully reach the glorious Canadian utopia, but for all my losses I haven't once felt discouraged or frustrated. You fire it up and go again, probably laughing at whatever it was that was your demise. It keeps the humor coming, and it is simultaneously hilariously out of place, and yet completely in tune with the crazy aesthetic. The replayability of this is off the scale for several different reasons. 

I love this game. My kid also loves this game. This is exactly what the Zombie trope needed."

												Basically RNG: The Game. 

Everything in this game is RNG, essential supplies is from RNG, HEALING event is RNG (WTF?), recruitment is from RNG, events are RNG (Usually never good, just RNG of which bad events you get), and the RNG in the game is designed against you.

The first layer of RNG is the crashes, if you survived that and thought you are good, don't worry, you are not, the rest of the RNG is by design.

For example, I made a healing character, had plenty of med supplies, but that character will never trigger the healing event even though people are almost dead. Then later down the road she died trying to pull her teeth out even though according to the dialog choice she use to be a dentist. 

Or another example, I made a mechanic to fix cars, but the game always insist on making my healer fix the car. And of course she can't fix the car because her stats in mechanics is too low, so on top of losing the car, she's also in a bad mood, which if low enough the member will leave permanantly.

Also your main NEEDS to be an mechanic because the moment you are on foot when your car breaks down, you either get robbed of all your supply (you can choose to fight the bandits but the RNG never let me win yet), or you lose your life tripping and hurt yourself on flat road (again WTF?). And once your food is all robbed, and your healing supply is all used up, your mood drops to rock bottom, and your character automatically leave the team, even your main character. And then it's game over.

There are so many more problem with this game I just can't be bothered listing them all at this time. The game don't feel complete, interface needs some ironing out, game needs SERIOUS re-balance. And the bugs is in your face, I'm certain the only reason the game have a save feature at all is for crashes. I mean you can't save manually, and you can't leave the game and come back either, I tried and my save is gone once I re-launched the game.

Not adviced to purchase until the game is fixed."

												8.5/10 game, 5/10 gameplay
This game isn't even RNG, the game director does everything it can to make it impossible for you to win. Extreme difficulty can be fun, but only if the difficulty can be overcome by enough skill.

I had the dream team of 2, a dog and a human, the dog was max intellect (to the point of being able to use a gun), and we had a fast car with 200 gas, 15 food, great weapons etc and the human decided to leave the death road while at NEUTRAL positivity, leaving the dog. Immiedietly after that, i was stuck in a 2 hour hoard in a mall, with so many zombies that the doors were blocked off with no possible escape while the room was quickly filling up, nothing to throw or anything. There was no decicion i could of made earlier in my gameplay that could of prevented that death.

With that out of the way, the gameplay you DO get before being excecuted is fun, plus the soundtrack is dank 

I'm only recommending this game to protect myself from a hundred fanboys that will swarm any negative comment about any game they play, and for anyone who likes getting hecked with a cactus over and over beause they enjoy the game up to that point"

-The combat

I'll jump straight to the main point...
You spend a lot of time fighting in this game so the combat system is gonna make or break the game for you... It's simplistic but you can't exactly button mash your way through. Which is a good thing. Repetitive swings will deplete your stamina so a weaker character will tire fast. It's a fun romp and the humor and soundtrack will win plenty of people over."

												 Target Audience:    Roguelike Action Fans

 Summary:   
Death Road To Canada is the essence of action roguelike gameplay: replayability, and yet simplicity with hidden layers of gameplay. While making your way to the land north of America, you'll be put into binds and situations that will force split-second decisions that can doom you. The mixture of the action gameplay along with the Oregon Trial like strategy gameplay works together rather well: as both end up enhancing the gameplay and choices of the other. And like a good roguelike: it's difficult, but manageable, forcing you to make difficult decisions that's not just there for show. It's the risk and reward mechanics that shine here: really rewarding you in pushing as far as your team can go without breaking, but punishing you heavily if you push too far. 
Sure, you're going to struggle with some of the controls at first. But these are the right kind of “inaccurate” controls: controls that complement the gameplay in question. The only major problem I have with the game is the crashes (which is being addressed by the developer), and the AI can be REALLY dumb at times, getting itself killed rather easily. But if you like anything in the roguelike genre mixed with action, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not picking up Death Road To Canada. It'll probably be on my “underrated games of the year” list, as it's not going to get the mainstream attention that it should. But you should give it your attention.

 Lists: 
Positives:
 Keeps the pressure on. Once you get past the first few days, you're feeling every battle. Resources are a godsend, and you'll never feel comfortable. 
 A great example of a good risk/reward system. Pushing your team to its edge in getting resources before the night comes, but pushing too far will usually hurt your team and maybe get it killed. 
 Smart decision making is rewarded. Understanding your teams strengths, and what option to choose based on it, will result in the appropriate outcome 90% of the time. There's just enough RNG added here to make things interesting, without making you feel like you're not in control. 
 Morale system in particular is actually implemented with some thought put behind it, and makes a difference when trying to go further and further. 
 You'll have to make hard decisions. Actual hard decisions. Not decisions that actually don't mean jack ♥♥♥♥ in the end. Like “Choose between these two characters. One goes away.” 
 Combat may be simple, but it's effective. It's about space management, and forces the player to think about how they can escape a room without losing anyone. It may be repetitive: but it's the good kind of repetitive. It's more about strategy and smart decisions made. 
 Some nice alternate weaponry that serves a specific purpose, like the cardboard tube. This gives you more reasons to vary up your arsenal. 
 Use of the environment is rewarded. Walking into a room with 50 zombies, only to yell “NOPE” and close the door behind you actually rewards you if you can get out without them noticing. Forcing enemies to bite through furniture can give you the space you need in order to deal with hordes.  
 I like the control set for the most part here, even if it can be unwieldy at times. The thing is, it complements the combat and the tone that the gameplay is going for. You're not supposed to be a super Walking Dead gunslinger. You're just bob from the local diner. It will actually take some time and experience in order to actually be a bad ♥♥♥.
 It's always fun to run across the different popular media and video game characters in the world they've created here. Adding Octodad to the team? Yeah, I dig it. 
 It's that goofy kind of realism. There's feral cats, Zombies, aliens, and gators you wrestle. And yet, for some reason, you think this is reasonable given the universe, and can see it happen. Oh, and the whole Octodad thing. 
Negatives:
 As of right now, I've had several crashes, but the developer is diligently working to solve the problems in question. Note that Windows 10 users may need to be weary of it.
 Your AI partners can be.....very very dumb. Walking into zombies without any thought process what so ever if you get even the least bit separated. 
 Wanted to see a button dedicated to switch characters. Would have made things a lot smoother in terms of using that feature. 
 Some of the randomness of the weapon degradation can be annyoing, because you really don't know what some of your weapons conditions are. 
 The visual style just doesn't help the game out in the end. It's got a lot of customization and elements that would be taken to the next level if it had the visual elements behind it."

												One part Zombieland, one part roguelike, and one part 2d action brawler, DRtC is the game that we all hope every zombie game will be. It is the game every zombie game promises to be. It's very specifically the game Organ Trail promised it would be.

I wish I was articulate enough to explain why this game is so good, why it's such a delight to play, and why it's so addictive. I can't, but I hope however high my hours played gets for this will serve as a testament.

Death Road To Canada is very, very good, and you should buy it."

												Saw some gaming YouTube channels I regularly watch play it, thought it was cool (especially since I'm fond of roguelikes), and added it to my wishlist on Steam and kind of forgot about it. 

Cue Autumn sale. Decided to buy it. Let it sit in my library for about a week or so before deciding to play.

All I can say is this: WOW.

Right from the start, it's pretty damn good. Nothing says ""awesome"" like slashing through zombies while going north (Though a zombie apocalypse seems more like an average day in Florida anyways). Sure, I haven't had too many runs so far, but they were surprisingly kind of intense. Every death sucks, especially in the times where I've gotten so far, but that's roguelikes for you, and that's why I love them.

Also, I'm Alexandra the resilient martial artist with a kitchen knife. Can't beat that."

												I started out with just a couple of randos, eventually met an Elvis impersonator who was so good at karate he didn't need weapons, then met myself and found out I was an enormous jackass. Along the road we  had to deal with loads of bandits, got really beefy, and charmed a dog into giving us free bullets. Unfortunately we all died at the Canadian border shortly after kicking the first member of the team out for being a grade-A dink.

Rocketcat's made another great game, and finally one that you can play on something other than a phone."

												Just finished my best run yet:

Start off with me and a gentle giant karate master named Greg
Greg and I go a few days with no mishaps and collect lots of supplies
We find some Mary Poppins knockoff on the side of the road
Let Mary Poppins join us on our journey to Canada
We journey onwards until we encounter a siege in the sewers
Mary Poppins' umbrella weapon isn't putting a dent in the zombies and it looks like all is lost
Suddenly Greg unleashes his kung fu fury and kills multiple zombies with one punch
We barely make it out of the sewers and we continue on our way
Soon after we take a dog named Karin into our group
A few days go by with nothing too unusual happening
We then find a custom character based on my friend that I made earlier
Mary Poppins gets the boot and my friend joins the group
Our team of four carves a path of carnage on the remainder of the trip to Canada
We have tons of supplies, tons of gas, and tons of food
Nothing could go wrong
The second last siege happens
We make it out with no casualties
Then comes the last siege
It's four minutes long in an average sized city
Too many zombies
We run in and out of buildings looking for supplies
I find some grenades
I pick them up as my character but switch to Greg afterwards to switch out a weapon
Badchoice.png
Zombies pile into the building
We could have handled them easily and escaped the building
But my character decides to throw two of the three grenades at the horde
We're in a very small building
I switch back to my character and sprint out of the building
Karin runs out of the building with me
Greg and my friend weren't so lucky
It's just me and Karin left with three more minutes until we can enter Canada
Karin and I survive for quite a while until she gets overwhelmed and dies
Guess it's up to me now
Run around the city with my shotgun and pitchfork trying to train the zombies
Only thirty seconds left
I'm overwhelmed but run to the edge knowing I can leave soon
Start shotgunning the incoming horde
Run out of bullets
Stuck trying to pitchfork the surrounding horde
Only five seconds left before I can leave
I die








10/10 would get my hopes up and then have them shattered at the last minute again"

												Got it as a gift from a friend. Cute game, lots of really cute and good ideas, but the gameplay is so frustratingly simple and the rng is stacked against you that it just becomes a slog to play through. You could be having a great time and then suddenly it throws at you a 2 hour long (ingame) seige with the worst settings, trapping you inside a tiny room with hundreds of zombies you can't do anything about. There is literally nothing you can do other than die in most cases. You can't even aim with your guns properly, even if your stats are high with it, because of the way the controls work. The game also goes for way too long for one default run so you'll be sitting there bashing your keyboard/game controller trying to start your car until your hands cramp.

I wouldn't recommend it personally, but can definitely see the appeal and you may get more mileage out of it than I did."

												A rouge with survival elements with a splash of internet humor. The game presents itself in two different play-styles: an Oregan Trail like decision making rpg overworld, and a Nuclear Throne like top down fighter where you scavenge for supplies and weapons. There is also a character customisation where you can design your own characters and give them particular traits to spice up the character, or you can find randomly generated characters to adenture with, topped with some preset special characters that have unique dialog, abilities and weapons. All of this is presented in beautiful and detailed pixel art.

I only have two gripes with DR2C,
-Its difficulty if the first. While I understand that it is a rougelike and your chances of winning consistantly without a high level of practice are very low. This game also heavily relies on good RNG on your characters stats and the events they are put in; which may turn people off. Generally I find there are two ways you can play DR2C, you either play silly in order to have fun, often resulting in bad things happening due to you telling everyone to ""COOL IT"", or you can play super optimally and boring, usually resulting in higher chances of victory but takes away some charm the game has.
-The second is the small amount of bugs the game has. So far my game is unable to enter fullscreen and just makes the screen black, which I assume is a resolution issue. The other problem that has only happened once is the game randomly crashing presenting you with an error code. However, being a newly released game with updates coming out every day, these problems are sure to be fixed if not shortly, in the future.

Overall DR2C is a great pick up game with runs lasting around 30-60 minutes, packed full with hilarious dialog and a vast array of characters. Good times will be had with this game, but if RNG reliant games bug you, you might want to wait till this title is on sale. If not, I highly recommend it!"

												Death Road to canada, a very hard yet enjoyable game. Hard because of how one second you have a full team where everyone is super good, but then when you get to a trader camp, have no food left, so then you steal some food from a trader, and then the whole camp kills everyone except your weak healer ;-;. Enjoyable because you could come a cross a very free horse man..... who cant wield any wepons so when your whole team dies excpet for him you basically are dead, which goes back to the hard thing XD. but there is a lot of replayability because of how everyone you meat on the road has random stats. There was this one time when i had a dog (o btw the dogs can talk and carry wepons XD) and she found a empty mascot suit that came to life and yelled ""I HATE MONDAYS!"", so then we did anything that a normal human would do, we recruted him to our group. But then things went wrong, one day while we were driving the suit just yell ""I HATE MONDAYS!"" and then he said ""AND TODAY IS A MONDAY"". then he teleported us all into a seige in a random set of woods and 2 of my people died, including my dog ;-;(just kidding it deserved it she was a jerk >:( ). so ya that is how i lost that game. But back to the actual review even with all of this fun stuff that i just talked about there are some cons one being the multiplayer, the second player has to each and everytime you go somewhere select the charrecter they want to play and join the fight which is realy tedious. Secondly the second player cannot go through doors which means, the first player has the infamous main charrecter deseas (but to a lower extent because they can die and the story goes on), this makes going through a house really annoying because the first player has to do everything. All in all this is a great game and i recomend it. And also the naked horse man is the most majestic thing i have seen in my life. :3"

												One More For The Road
When I first saw this game before release, I thought it was ok.
After the Dog Release Trailer, I was very intrigued.
Then Vinny from Vinesauce and his ""virtual-self who will never see Canada due to everything killing him"" sold it for me.

     I love this game. This game, without a doupt, has that ""One more go and I'll stop but you keep playing"" hold on you. The combat reminds me of Dark Souls where you must pace yourself. The music is catchy and will put you in a good mood no matter how bad your day IRL was. The comedic outcomes of events are fantastic, showing that this whole journey is for the fun then for the zombie drama. The characters will always make you laugh with the stupid stuff they get into, even in death. It's just wonderful.

     The game has a few flaws but nothing a patch won't fix like AI characters geting stuck juggling duplicate weapons on the ground, items on Y'all Mart shelfs not being clearly visiable for picking up, not knowing what day it is (looking at you Monday) and not being able to ""Always Be Looting"" whenever you wish. Overall, this game worth every can of food. If I were to suggest a few things to add to this game-

3DS/Vita Ports
I need this on the go, please!

4 Player Online/MMO Co-Op
2 Player Local Co-Op is nice but I don't have anyone to play with. Online would help. While your at it, bump it up to 4 players for more mayhem. Prehaps while playing Online we may bump into another player who needs help and team up for a bit.

Rare Character Select and More Rare Characters
I feel once a rare character is found, you should be able to play as them when starting up a new game, but only in the mode they were found in. (i.e Found Lank in Rare Mode, Lank is playable in all Rare Mode Options.) The current selection of Rare Characters is hillarious but we need more; like Doomguy, Issac, Mayro, Sanic, Puc-Man, The L4D and Dead Island Survivors, the Protect-Me Knights/Gotta Protectors, Fazbear & Friends, Robbie Rotten, and more!

More Rare Rides
Just more please. I could list so many; The Time Travaling DeLorean, Mad Max's Machine, Classic Ecto 1, The Bat Mobile, Santa's Sleigh, Cars from Wacky Racers, TF2 Sniper's Camper Van, The Flintstone's Car, Thomas the Tank Engine's Bertie Bus (Hell thrown in Thomas as well cause why not?), and more! 

No Hitch-hikers Allowed Mode
Pick 1-4 characters and they will be the only ones you can play with.

USA Tour Mode
Tour ALL 50 States before reaching Canada. Starting in Florida and ending in Alaska; To Canada or Bust.

More Custom Character Options
More Heads, Hairs, Skin tones, Body sizes, Misc, Clothing, Perks, Save slots, and more please! Also, Saveable Stats, Choice of starting weapon, and an option for Rare Perks earned by Rare Characters (or least they bump a perk up to 4 stars).

More Animals
I wanna see more crazy animals to team up with or even ride. Ask Jontron if his ""Robotic bird"" Jacques can be put in to shoot zombies with his lazor beam eyes.

More Zambies
Don't take that too literal, I'm more refering to more looks and even ""Speical Infected"". Custom Zombie Maker, maybe?

Level Editor
An option to make our own maps that may randomly generate into the mix of places to visit.


Seriously, worth every can of food so far, keep up the good work."

												I added me and my wife as custom characters. We came across a dog holed up in an appartment building and recruited him onto our team. A few miles down the road my wife and the dog proceed to have an arguement and she made me choose between her and the dog. 

This was the hardest choice I've ever made in my entire life.

												I can't say enough praise about this game, but not everything is flawless.

First and foremost, the music. I love the music and it's so happy and really brings out the emotion within this game, there is only a couple sad/intense songs which might drive certain people away from this game. Also to go along with the music is the pixel aesthetic. However, the pixel theme makes the characters very simple and their features become hard to distinguish. But the thing the game does beautifully with the art is backgrounds, the color and motion the scenery provides is nice to look at and really adds to the atmosphere.

Game play:
There's two sections of game play within Death Road to Canada: the action section and the Oregon Trail RNG Strategy DND Skill Checkin' Character Deathin' Road to the Maple Syrupy Hockey Land of Stereotypes Eh? section. The action phase consists of you and your party picking up whatever weaponry is lying around and bashing the brains out of some un-dead walking corpses, there is no special abilities or attacks but there is a stamina function. This stamina function limits you in a good way, because you can't swing(but you can shoot) wildly, forcing you to be smart about your attacks, also factored by the size of the hoard, and the location of the horde. During these action phases, you will be doing one of two things: looting or defending. Always Be Looting, your source of resources defined by your choice of location to go find the good stuff in. Then there is siege. I hate siege. A siege is where you are confined to a small area of map for an extended period of time left with whatever you find and what you have on you to fend against increasingly large hoards of zombabos- some of these are really, REALLY, difficult if you don't have a reasonable supply of bullets and guns.

On to the RNG aspect portion of the game. Your typical food and gas and such, but there is also a great system of morale. Morale is simple, it's how happy your party members are. Good morale will keep things running while bad morale will lead to run ending situations- keep your morale high by having enough supplies. I think the morale system is fair and not overly imposing so it adds a fun layer to the car ride to Canada. Along the road you will have to make several choices, and what may seem like the correct answer is not always the right answer. There are a lot of hard decisions that are designed to screw you over- unless you have a person with enough skill to get you out of that sticky situation. There are an assortment of skills and they each do different things, some carry over into the action portions while the others exist purely for the car portions- you will want to keep these up as they will get you out of ALOT of bad times. Other than that everything else is pretty cookie-cutter.

Now most of this game is great, but one thing this game does not do well is UI. The UI is very interrupting, as the only way to switch your party leader is via the pause menu in-game, which really takes away from that intense horde fight going on. Also ammo splitting is the most needed thing in the UI but it's not fully there, as in there is not a specific way to do this, and the current system is confusing. The UI looks nice enough but the functionality needs to be a lot better- there's no direct switching of items from party member to party member in the pre-mission gear assignment screen.
Hopefully this will get implemented however.

Overall if you are into rougelikes, this game is great for beginners and experienced fans of the genre looking for a greater challenge- some of the modes are ball-bustingly hard for all you masochists out there. Give it a shot and I'm sure you will love this game."

												I've been following Rocketcat Games for years now, since their early iOS days...
While I had been thoroughly disappointed in that they weren't making games for PC, I was thrilled when the kickstarter released for this game.

Sadly, I didn't have the funds to back it at the time, although it's great to see a kickstarter game that actually gets finished.

The game is really great. It's tough, like every rogue-like Rocketcat game.
Randomness sometimes doesn't seem too random, seems to give dull loot and dull character encounters. Especially when you modify the save files and find out what in all is actuall IN this game.

In the end, I wish there was more to the game, but I am still very satisfied with my purchase. The devs seem to be continuously adding. Highly recommend this game."

												I beat the game twice one time on regular and Familiar Characters Mode out of the 25 run. Very funny on the thing you pick can save your butt most of the time. Alway keep up morale or your character start to leave by steal your supplies. Game is good but the game make it you have to have all slot fill or a S*** load of zombies are gonna f*** you up like you run out of breath be all red and can't swing your weapons. Best tip when you rob, rob people that are trading for food or gas. Never rob the weapon master cause  most of the time they will kill you or your hold group takes 2 damage.

Over all this game end really fast depends on your character and their ability to stay calm or be stronger with melee weapon or start with better weapon. Can customize your own characters. Wish i had more place to explore to get more supplies cause only one or two house fill with junk just makes it harder to beat the game. I give it a 4 out of 5.

P.s NEVER ADD JASON TO YOUR TEAM....."

												I despise zombie games.  There are SO many zombie games these days, and tv shows for that matter, that they aren't done with any real sense of quality.  Deathroad to Canada is a completely different beast.  Yes it has zombies and for some it may be the focus of the game.  For me it's not.  I can honestly say I haven't felt this refreshed with a zombie esque type game in a very long time, the last was Zombie Estate 1 and 2 for Xbox 360 from the indie dev selection.  When I initially heard about this game I had reservations.  Only upon watching people play, like Vinesauce who ironically solidified my decision to buy this gem, did I realise this game was far better than it seems at times.  The genuine tongue and cheek humor adds flavor to moments when you are stuck in a room with 30+ zombies pining after you like some schoolgirl over her boy band crush.  As of writing this I have YET to actually beat the game.  This doesn't frustrate me or anything because each time I get close, I am sent into erratic displays of giddy laughter.  Can't tell you how many times I think I'm doing great only to lose my car, then get swarmed by a massive horde of zombies in a horrible attempt to find another vehicle.   By the end I'm left with 1 person, sometimes a bat wielding dog who happens to know how to DRIVE :P.  Needless to say I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and everyone who asked my opinion."

												Highly recommended. Great retro style graphics with a clear design and aesthetic throughout and awesome gameplay to go right along with it. Combines excellent action elements with enough randomly generated events to continue to be awesome, interesting, and different on each run through. Easy to pick up but rewards repeated plays as you try different combinations of characters and if the developers past games are any indication expect some great additional content updates."

												Rogue-like with beat-em-up flavor.  The gameplay mechanics are simple, but there's strategy not only on an active surface level but also at a deeper character development/inventory control level that keeps you continually engaged  One of the most enjoyably replayable game I've owned.  There's so many random encounters and situations the game doesn't get old."

												A rouge with survival elements with a splash of internet humor. The game presents itself in two different play-styles: an Oregan Trail like decision making rpg overworld, and a Nuclear Throne like top down fighter where you scavenge for supplies and weapons. There is also a character customisation where you can design your own characters and give them particular traits to spice up the character, or you can find randomly generated characters to adenture with, topped with some preset special characters that have unique dialog, abilities and weapons. All of this is presented in beautiful and detailed pixel art.

I only have two gripes with DR2C,
-Its difficulty if the first. While I understand that it is a rougelike and your chances of winning consistantly without a high level of practice are very low. This game also heavily relies on good RNG on your characters stats and the events they are put in; which may turn people off. Generally I find there are two ways you can play DR2C, you either play silly in order to have fun, often resulting in bad things happening due to you telling everyone to ""COOL IT"", or you can play super optimally and boring, usually resulting in higher chances of victory but takes away some charm the game has.
-The second is the small amount of bugs the game has. So far my game is unable to enter fullscreen and just makes the screen black, which I assume is a resolution issue. The other problem that has only happened once is the game randomly crashing presenting you with an error code. However, being a newly released game with updates coming out every day, these problems are sure to be fixed if not shortly, in the future.

Overall DR2C is a great pick up game with runs lasting around 30-60 minutes, packed full with hilarious dialog and a vast array of characters. Good times will be had with this game, but if RNG reliant games bug you, you might want to wait till this title is on sale. If not, I highly recommend it!"

												True story...

Added my brother into the game as a custom character. He gets picked up by a party of three. They then all encounter a siege and all but my brother (named Dead Man) die. Next loot phase, he finds a machine, which I have him enter. He comes out with stat boosts and is now a dog. He manages to finish that loot phase without dying.

Game indicates everyone is dead... but wait, there's still a dog. My brother turned dog then focuses on going to Canada and proceeds to DRIVE THE CAR.

Next, we encounter bandits. Bandits let brother pass because, oh, he's just a dog.

He then proceeds to pick up a person before coming across a cabin with a chainsaw, which he proceeds to pick up (being I'm controlling him) and starts killing zombies with a chainsaw while walking on his hind legs.

If this wasn't enough, the next loot phase, he finds a blowtorch and lights himself on fire by accident, killing himself.

I have never laughed this hard playing a game.

10/10, would endlessly die traveling to Canada again. Great game."

												Got DANG is this game unforgiving, one misguided decision and your entire run is ruined. Get the chainsaw or a special character with a strong weapon, try not to lose it/them. Don't have too many animals on the team (unless you're going for ""cheevos""), they can't hold a lot usually and most animals can't drive if you run out of humans; only dogs can. Look at your characters' stats and skills: they will help you make key decisions that will make or break your run. Don't lose your car.

Pros:
• Play as almost anyone: make characters of your friends and family, be a random famous pop culture icon, several different animals. Give custom characters useful perks and skills to balance your team.
• Each playthrough feels fresh and unique
• Character stats are surprisingly intricate and faithful to the history of roguelikes
• Music is pretty killer (although sometimes they loop somewhat less than seamlessly 
• New team members can be recruited fairly quickly, keeping the gameplay fresh
• RNG is your best friend

Cons:
• Weapon stamina works in an unorthodox kind of way, can be obstructive at times
• Very easy to get stuck behind rubble or a wall, making yourself easy pickings for a nasty horde
• Very easy to completely fk up your game with a single bad decision
• jfk this game is fckin hard as hell how do I get past the last seige
• RNG is Satan incarnate

Overall: good, clean, humorous, soul-crushingly-difficult zombie-killin' character-buildin' fun. Be mindful of your neighbors when you scream after losing."

												A very fun game, but not without it's faults. 

While I enjoy each run I do, mostly due to the excellent soundtrack and humor, I've yet to actually reach Canada, though. Pretty much every time I get to the last day I've been stopped by an overwhelmingly huge siege of zombies in a tiny room, and my team dies pretty quickly afterwards. Not sure if the final massive wave is a set event or if I'm just unlucky, since my sample size is admittedly pretty small. It might be this game's version of Oregon Trail's river challenge, but unlike dodging rocks on a river, a siege of that size seems kinda impossible to complete.

I get that it's a survival game (which is one of the main things keeping me from becoming frustrated with bad RNG,) but I feel like the difficulty curve makes it really hard to recommend this to a general audience. If you're a results-driven person who needs to win to have fun or feel a sense of accomplishment, I think this game would be very frustrating. If you're okay with just seeing how far you can get and letting the trip ride out while enjoying some excellent music, I think you'd have a pretty good time. That said - even while I enjoy the journey, I feel like my best runs would be much more satisfying if I actually felt as if I had any chance of succeeding near the end. I have a really fun time playing, but it's sort of disappointing to have a run where you play/manage your resources well to only have the game tell you ""nah, not this time, buddy.""

What I'm saying is, it's a fun game, and a good way to burn some time, but could be a lot more satisfying with a rebalance patch or a casual mode. Either could make the game much more accessible, I think."

												This game will f&$% you up. You need to have the holy power of the RNG to survive. Now, that does not make this a bad game, it makes it realistic, for a zombie apocalypse anyways. I started off with two people. All was going well, then we met another guy, and we let him join. Then, a seige happened. A seige is where you have to hold out long enough before escaping, which can last a while. My original partner died. Blah Blah Blah anime katanas, blah blah blah Prius, and we find a girl, and let her join. Blah Blah Blah Raiders, Blah Blah Blah Supermarket, another seige. Now this time, there's two other people trapped in here with us, a police officer, and what looked like a scientist. My guy was the only survivor, after we all got cornered, and I was the only person who tried to run through the zombies, instead of fighting them. So I drive for a while longer, nobody else shows, supplies are running low, and I find this car, which looks like it has supplies. Aaaaaand the keys are missing. I walk around the surrounding area ducking and weaving, trying to find the keys, and then I find this log cabin, which is overrun with ZED, I try to run inside, but get pinned in a corner, like those I had left behind, and I died fighting. So yeah, amazing brand new game, go play it now."

And I really mean it, the soundtrack is glorious and betrays the whole atmosphere of the game.
Surrounded by zombies? This catchy tune will help you numb the pain.
No fuel for your car? How about something upbeat, so you won't think about your invetiable demise?
Swarmed by an army of zombies and no bullets left? Time for a groovy tune, to serve as your funeral song.

Story and universe are immersive and ''possible'' enough. (sorry I'm french so my english is horrible).

I play with xbox 360. For the gameplay it work fine. In the menu, its horrible. Still playable tought. One patch away from being good. Maybe the dev love the keyboard, but the it feel more natural to play with the xbox controller.

The difficulty seem pretty good. IN the first playthrougth It took a long before I loose. After my defeat, I jumped immediably right into it.

My general comment on the layout. Close the door of the can't enter house. Sometime you can pass over the junk pile, sometime you can't. It's confusing.

Will play again and will try the multiplayer."

												This game is amazing! Even on 'easy' it's still a great challenge and despite all the countless, horrorible deaths me and my friends and family in game went through, it was always fun to start it back up and try again. 

My only complaint(very minor though), is that when i have familar mode on, I only ever got 3 or 4 of the 8 characters i've made. Like the same few characters over and over and none of the others. 

If you still have doubts getting this game, just watch Projared play it and you'll be sold"

												tl;dr: A roguelike zombie survival game done right. 

There's many things about this game that just keep making making me tell myself ""one more try"" even after I've been playing it for hours. So far the only bug I've seen is when you get through a tiny space and your teamates will make an entire circle around the object so that they can get to you, that got my teamates killed many, many times.

One of my best runs so far, was with a guy named Dik, I gave him Megabuff and Warrior and tried to make him look like a biker. He had basically become a zombie master, with almost all abilities maxed out. I was 1 day from Canada, had more than 60 food and died to a molotov I threw at a group of zombies during a siege. My dog was the only one left, and even though he survived the siege, I hadn't teached him to drive a car, so I ended up losing and starting over. But I couldn't be mad at the game, because it was my fault.

Now, onto the pros and cons.

PROS:
+Randomly generated maps, survivors and personalities.
+Random events (I once got my character possessed by a demon)
+Zombies get more aggressive the more time you spend on a mission
+YOU CAN THROW FURNITURE AROUND!
+The game has a good sense of humour
+Decent amout of skills and perks to choose from, and you can level up your skills
+Teamates who are actually smart about weapon choice. For example, if your follower is using a melee weapon but gets tired and is carrying a ranged weapon, it will change to the ranged weapon until it has enough stamina back. It will also pick up weapons on the ground when it has none left.

CONS:
-Not many customization options, females get more than males
-The follower's pathfinding sometimes bugs out
-Sometimes if there's a weapon on the floor, your teamate will keep changing his weapons continuously until you move away from it
-Only local co-op.

All in all, i'd give this game a solid 9/10. I really love this game and hope to see it getting some new updates soon"

Yes we Canadians have armed forces equipped with ice hockey sticks, everyone is blonde, we got moose commandos, beaver pets and we got insane amount of igloos all around the country. Our people always use ""eh!"" at least once in every sentence. We have snow even in summer but most importantly!

My #1 complaint is poor AI companion pathfinding, and with such a small team, it may be a while before they can really sort it out. But the updates so far have been very encouraging, so if you can get over some unfair deaths and losses and just look forward to trying new stuff on the next run, I can't recommend this enough."

												I may not have that many runs in yet but this game is great. My best run so far was when my buddy had dog friend as a perk and kept attracting dogs to the cause. About five days in I felt I was doing well then it happened. A seige completly devasted me killing the two humans in my party. One getting trapped in the horde and the other overcome by the grief of losing his partner charged head first shooting his shotgun as much as possible. All the while my lassy dog fighting with all its heart trying to save who ever was left. It only lasted seconds though the lassy all that remained. Making a getaway just as the horde closed in the dog was all I had left. Then my lassy decided it was time to stick those keys into the ignition and drive. The next day my lassy was mauled by a moose it was trying to help and thus ended my best run. 10/10"

												In Death Road to Canada, you are a survivor making their way from Florida to Canada in a brutal zombie-infested roadtrip. Along the way you'll meet friends, enemies, and frenemies with their own randomized skills and characteristics. You can also create your own survivors and set their appearence and traits. The undead, bandits, and your own ineptitude will put your survival skills to the test as you collect food, fuel, medicine, and bullets. All of which are important on the Death Road.

The highlight of Death Road to Canada is the absurdity of it. Mexican wrestlers, giant bug-eyed anime girls, or a Monday-hating orange cat can be meet on the road as RARE characters. Reading SWOLE magazine increasing your strength or transforming your dog into a Dogman, the randomized events on the Death Road make each attempt more interesting than the last. All while making you laugh, this game will punch you in the gut with its difficulty and other game modes to mix things up.

I wholeheartedly recommend this game for its replayability, awesome soundtrack, and the comedic tone that makes it a memorable roadtrip simulator.

												More than just a bunch of combat & survival gameplay, DR2C is a story creator. On my very first playthrough, I really felt invested in the characters I managed to save and recruit -- they had personalities, skills and weaknesses, and felt like real, fleshed-out characters. Their adventure was marked by funny moments, big losses and lucky finds. Their ending was brutal and tragic. I expect to have thoroughly different experiences on each playthrough and look forward to that."

												An top down survival horror affair. Like Organ Trail but with more action and less Rest (4 Hours). It keeps the tone light and campy-- Canada is the last surviving nation in the world, escape to it and live out the zombie apocalypse.

As an example of a winning game: I started with two random characters because I was tired of getting my brother and I killed by zombies. Turns out I met both myself and my bro on the way there. I died to zombies, and my brother made it to a scientific lab alone, where a ""science machine"" turned him INTO A DOG. He then proceeded to drive the car all the way up to Canada, where he became what I assume must be the first honorary talking, sentient dog-citizen of the Great Nation of Canada. This, after fighting off the incoming hordes with a chainsaw and the aid of the Mounties.

The permadeath is frustrating, but the lighthearted writing and sharp, simple gameplay will keep you coming back until you make it to America's Hat."

												After having watched Vinny Vinesauce play this, I decided to give it a try. RNGesus can either be your best friend or an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ in this game. You can customize the characters you want to play, as well as give them certain stats/perks. But trust me, no matter how good you make out your character to be, RNG can take him/her down easily. It's no wonder that many people struggle to get a certain character to Canada, since it's 15 in-game days long and a lot of RNG-based events can take place during that time.

I, for one, was on the last day with my own customized character, but was also in a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation. With low health, not much ammo, weak melee weapons and not-so-good stats, I just couldn't make it. SO close, but yet so far.

This is also a good game to stream in the future when I actually can stream. But either way, this game's awesome and I highly recommend it."

- Create chibi survivor version of the dog whisperer ""Cesar""
- Recruit rotating small army of disposable dogs (and a witch's cat) to scavange and fight for me
- Have dog named Quinton save Bruce Lee and is taught Kung Fu as reward
- Kung Fu dog Quinton becomes only survivor of nasty hoard attacking alien ship
- Surprised (though at this point I shouldn't be) that Quinton learns to drive the car 
- Using him I finish the quest down ther death road to Canada!

												I loved Darkest Dungeon, the idea of sending a party of your friends into random situations is a great one. Death Road to Canada uses a similar system, however instead of walking through dungeons you are adventuring on to Canada. On your way to Canada you will experience a vast number of different events. These events can range from meeting travellers that end up joining your party to encountering bandit, bodybuilding enthusiasts. These events are the foundation for the game and offer plenty of re-playability to the game itself. 

Exploration
Moving on from the in-game events, lets address one of the negatives I have with the game, exploration. Each building you venture into is extremely lacking in the creativity department. Most buildings will be filled with gas, food and weapons. The problem is to find all of them, you will want to search every room, this creates very boring scenarios of you and your friend searching through empty rooms which are literally empty. They could have atleast added some furniture to make them feel more authentic, but instead if you enter a room with nothing but a bunch of garbage blocking off a door. You instantly know to turn around because it will be one of the MANY empty and pointless rooms in this game. Just to clarify my criticism here Is that the rooms are completely baron of ANYTHING, they didn’t have to contain usable items, but I would have liked to see these rooms contain some sort of personality or baring. Not only did this make exploration, long and arduous but it really encouraged players to skip exploring entirely If they already had enough supplies to last them a while. 

Visuals/Graphics
And now is the part of every review where I talk graphics. Now this game has that same pixelated art style we have all become VERY familiar with over the years. It seems that after one game tried using this retro look EVERY possible indie promotion started using it for reasons I can’t recognise. Luckily here it fits decently, as the world created around your survivors is wacky enough to fit the strange 80’s style visuals. 

Performance
No surprise here with its low CPU and GPU intensive graphics, the game runs fineand they offer you some nice, complementary options; fliters for the screen if you want to go full 80's mode, stylistic screen tearing toggle options and fully rebindable keys. I should also mention that all actions in the game can be changed on controller as well as the keyboard, when you are playing co-op with a friend I found that this was a nifty addition to controller users.

Music
As for the music, it’s quite strange. Normally in a zombie game where you’re fighting for survival you wouldn’t have fun up-beat music sounding off in the background. But much like the visuals it works well with the cheesy game the developers are creating. It took me a while to get used to it but after I did, I can’t imagine going back to the solemn soundtracks of past zombie games. 

Combat
Combat feels decent enough, it doesn’t take away anything from the game but it felt too basic to warrant praise of any kind. In combat you can use guns, melee weapons and explosives. Melee weapons use up your character’s stamina, your character’s stamina is measured in the traits your character has unlocked. Obviously more physically athletic survivors will be able to use their melee weapon for longer without getting tired. The gun play is fine, the game automatically locks on to zombies you are facing which works well enough. I am slightly dissapointed as it felt like the developers were catering a little too much to the controller users rather than the much more plentiful keyboard and mouse users, thsi is ecspecially the case with the gun play, it felt like their main goal was to dumb it down completely so that controller users wouldn't be left behind by the vastly superior PC controls. But in saying that, it's not necessarily a bad system of combat, I just feel like it takes away the benefit of using a keyboard and mouse to a slight degree, and let me highlight the word slight, this is a MINOR nitpick. 

Conclusion
Overall Death Road to Canada is a fun game to play with your friends, you can laugh at the random events that occur and dance to the funky music playing in the background while killing zombies constantly. However, without friends this game is quite bland, exploration is quite a linear experience and on your own the combat feels dreadfully average."

												Wow... now this is an interesting game. Basically Oregon Trails with zombies and a healthy (And heavy) dose of humor that suddenly pops up in the strangest places. Just to give you an example of this seriously hard but enjoyable game, I'll just mention my best run yet. 
Start off with two of my own characters, quickly recruited two more, and raided multiple places including buttville's police department. 
Then a rather hard siege came. I lost one; an annoying woman who was always tlaking about getting swole who bore copper goggles and a pink mohawk. But she died. Then, we went and found some traders- it was actually just a talking, standing dog selling ammunition, very casually. After him, we went and raided a collapsed Y'all mart... and we lost two of our people in a vain attempt to loot sugar cakes and cans of nodescript meat. 
And eventually, after crashing a car over a fissure in the ground and stealing an exterminator's van (Complete with giant plastic ant on the roof), I met Horse. 
Majestic, fast, valiant... and completely ♥♥♥♥ing insane. Basically, he was a completely naked man who would just neigh, wore a horse mask, and ran twice as fast as other characters. And low and behold, he would become the hero of this story. 
The last remaining survivor of my original group eventually diedin yet another siege, and for a long time, Horse marched on alone; charing through salvagable areas without even killing a single zombie because he could not swing a weapon. (For those are not arms, but his ""Forelegs""!) But due to some loophole the devs missed, he could shoot a gun and he became wonderous with that shotgun of his. 
Soon, I went and rescued a big fluffy white dog that took to Horse, and for nearly five days it was those two, riding on in several more cars (One which Horse managed to fix), having highly intelligent conversations between their barks and neighs. 
Eventually, the dog died in a sewer, trying to protect her equine partner. The dog and the horse- a partnership that wasn't destined to last! But Horse eventually found another companion, a bright purple haired woman with a big pistol that did much of the talking for those last few days. 
And then Canada, our last objective, came into view. Three sieges happened before, though... and good gods, fear those sieges. Especially when you're Horse. 
My purple-haired companion perished halfway into the first one (Her pistol was big, but not big enough). Horse survived the second without barely a scratch, running in circles for two hours in game time to avoid the zombies. 
But the final siege was twice as strong, and, two miles (I think) from his goal, Horse died as he had lived, running endlessly. 

This is a wonderful, brilliant game that holds plenty of surprises. It's a bit pricey, but it's worthwhile, trust me."

												This game is as addicting as it is similar to playing FTL but with zombies and decisions. You and your party have to escape to the borders of Canada since the USA is having a zombie apocalypse and oh boy, you will have a variety of choices and events in your journey since the destination is sort of like reaching Mt Everest or finding a lost treasure. In gameplay, you have to loot resources from places from food to gas, weapons, etc in order to survive the journey. But be careful, zombies in this game are numerous so you have to be hasty or cautious depending on what you're dealing with and have to battle your way in and out. You also have to plan ahead as your resources easily run out.

Pros:

+ Replayability (You will get a lot of game overs if you're not prepared. The fact you have plenty of customization as well as events to help you succeed is why it's really enjoyable whenever I repeat the game. Wanna go Leeroy Jenkins? Get a BERSERK character. Rather play safe and smart? Paranoid characters are your brains.)

+ Variety (Characters, weapons, events, cars, etc, I lost count how many events there are and some are even references to characters from games, movies, real life people, etc. I won't spoil who but it's a lot fun discovering the silly references the devs put in. The characters also have their own stats and traits so keep in mind on them. )

+ Customization (You can customize characters that you wanna put in like naming them  because they'll appear in the game when you find them. The strong parts are the traits and perks you can put in which have their pros and cons. They can help you or betray you depending on the situation)

+ Music (For a zombie apocalypse game, it sure fits well with some happy ones as well as 'LET'S KICK SOME ZOMBIE BUTT"" music. Very enjoyable. )

+ Graphics (Pixel art as the main art style, it's simple but it shows it really well. I do wish the characters faces look a little better but hopefully in a sequel or such, they'll make it better)

+ Dogs/Cats are playable (They can loot and shoot...SOLD! )

I don't have much cons for this game but I'll just give my little nit picks

Nitpicks:

- RNG (RNG is what makes the fun and despair of a game though I feel that a lot of bad stuffs happen more to me IMO. Though that's part of the fun so take this as a grain of salt.)

- More character customization ( I know this is a pro but I do want more clothes or at least a workshop for this game. If there's mods I would love to see it happen)

Overall, I give this game a 9/10. I would have given it a 10 if it had a lot more customization than now because the game literally screams for one. If this game were to get a sequel then I'd be a happy man. If you love zombies, surviving, FTL-like games, maybe this might be for you. Otherwise, just look at a video or 2 of gameplay and see if it convinces you to buy.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

The car ran out of gas. 
I stubbed my toe. 
A bee flew into the car. 
Your favorite survivor steals everything and abondons the group. 
A demon possesses a survivor and demands food. 
Bandits with guns demand all your food, gas, medical supplies, and personal belongings. 
A magical genie appears then turns out to be one of those evil genies.

												Awesome rogue survival game!
If you like these games, like FTL, Binding of Isaac, Dungeon of the endless ect. then this game will entertain your tortured soul.

Random Events, Zombies, Survival, Zombiegore, Pixelshit and crazy folks (you can even make your own characters to play and even show up during your journey).
The more you play it, the more stuff you'll unlock, also you level up skills/traits and the progress of these will never be lost.

Saw this on Greenlight years ago and was waiting for the release and i am not disappointed.


Only minor complain: No steam-achievements, but meh, FTL doesn't have em' aswell and it's still awesome."

												This game will make you laugh and cry. 
It's like Oregon trail but with zombies and humor. 
First few tries, you don't mind dying but after that you just want to finish so when you do it feels amazing.
Pretty dificult sometimes even with the, ""Rare Characters"" mode which makes it easier to find unusual but powerful characters.

I found this game really enjoyable for the time that I played it, which wasn't really 45 hours, I just happened to leave my PC on overnight a few times with the game open. I told myself that I would play the game more after I initially finished it the first time but when I started a new playthrough right after I actually finished it, I kept thinking I wanted to take a break and play a different game. Still, for $15 dollars this game is to me, a must have because it's 100% worth the experience.

10/10 would tell people to  C O O L  I T  again."

												How can I summarize this game? I started out with a guy who was a friend of dogs. With his best buddy. They got into a fight and split leaving just him on the road with some dogs he picked up. Then he got sick of the road and decided to call it quits. He told the french poodle of the party to remember everything he had taught it and wished the dogs farewell.

Now its just the two dogs driving to canada in an ice cream truck. My poodle become well trained and can also walk around using a pump shotty on two hind legs.

10/10

The game is a mix of oregon trail meets binding of isaac. I love it.

EDIT:
Crashes were fixed ages ago the game keeps getting updated and more improvements made by the devs. I have about 100 hours in this game and I still haven't found everything to find in it. The game offers a lot of play value for 15 bucks and frankly, so far is my game of the year.


Edit 2: 11/28/2016
This is still the best game of 2016 and well worth the price.

Yeah the game has only gotten better and beter. The devs arep utting in a lot of love and deserve credit."

												ROADTRIIIIIIIIIIIIP!

EVERYONE NEEDS THIS GAME

Seriously though I have no idea why this isn't a more popular game, it's so amazing, it's one of the best roguelites I've played to this day. Comedy, difficulty, amazing music, and everything else. This game is a game I can see myself sinking multiple hours into, I have 10.5 hours into it already and I only bought it like 5 days ago, not much until you realize I've only spent like the last 2 of those 5 days playing games, and I was still busy as hell. This game really really needs to be noticed more, because it's an absolute gem amongst indie games.

Oh, and also always remember, cool it."

												Pros:
+Pick up and play or spend time customizing characters
+Overall progression as well as current playthrough progression
+Hilarious writing and theme
+Simple gameplay, graphics, and sound (you might be able to play this on a ten-year-old computer)
+Rare events add extra replay value, ensuring that you'd have to play dozens of times to see everything

Cons:
-Random difficulty even in normal will make you start over from the beginning and play again because you keep telling yourself ""this will be the one"" until you realize it's 2 in the morning on a school night (is that a con?)
-Only time I beat it was when a dog I didn't even like was good at running away

If you like roguelike-likes, Oregon Trail type games, zombies, retro graphics, humor, and making characters based on your family and friends and watching them die horribly for stupid reasons, you will like this game.
On the other hand, if you think the destination is more important than the journey, this game will frustrate you like no other. Don't expect to be able to make it to Canada every time, even if you think you're prepared for everything.

10/10 would sacrifice myself and all I love to save a stupid dog again"

												Death Road To Canada is a randomly generated zombie survival road trip simulator with tough yet rewarding gameplay and hours upon hours of zombie slaughtering fun.

Story
Death Road To Canada follows two survivors of a zombie apocalypse as they try to make their way to the safe confines of the beautiful country of Canada. There is no specific story since the vibe of the game is almost a make-your-own adventure type and RNG does play a high role in the gameplay. Although there is no story as such, along the way you’ll meet new survivors and NPCs (if you stay alive long enough) and there is plenty of dialogue and little random events.

General Gameplay
When you start the game you’ll begin with a few supplies like food and medicine and your car (which is where a good chunk of your gameplay will be spent). You’ll travel in your car (or on foot if you happen to run out of gas or break your vehicle) and it’ll be from there you’ll encounter random events, traders, new locations, bandits and even sometimes new survivors to join your group. Travelling in your car will consume gas and travelling no matter how you do it will also consume food which is one of the most important resources. Without food your group will starve, the more they starve the lower their ‘morale’ drops and once a person's morale is completely gone it is highly likely they will abandon the group. The more group members you have the more manpower you wield but also you’ll consume more food so remember that when picking up new survivors.
Along your journey you’ll find various location that you’ll have the choice to loot if you wish too but you can also choose to pass them by. Sometimes you’ll find a solitary location and others you’ll find two to pick from and each location's name will be kinda relative to what you find at that location e.g supermarket = food, hardware store = melee weapons. Displayed alongside the location name will also be details of the location you’re about to enter such as the size of the zombie swarm, how aggressive they are and the time of day. These three things massively affect whether you’re successful at that location or not so you do have to take them into consideration when playing or you’ll quickly end up as zombie chow. Once you’ve assigned any weapons you may have to your survivors you can enter your location where you’ll be able to loot and kill at will. You’ll usually find a bit of loot and maybe an NPC, sometimes you’ll find something a little more rare. 
Each survivor has hidden stats which you won’t be able to see until they need to be used or you level them up for example you won't know if John is a good Mechanic until he tries to fix a car or increases that specific skill. Most survivors start pretty weak but the progression system in the game increases each trait that survivors randomly have as you complete specific things throughout your runs. 
My favourite part of Death Road To Canada is the ability to add all your friends/family/enemies/acquaintances to the game as survivors you’ll have a chance to meet along the way. You’re able to name them, choose what they look like and wear and their traits and then either load them into your game from the start as your starting survivors or hope to come across them randomly in normal gameplay. There is a mode that increases your chances of coming across custom survivors so if you want to play a game where you’re likely to find all your friends then you can. The Custom Game Mode isn’t the only game mode you’ll find though, there are several ranging from change in difficulty to change in your trip length so there are lots of options for replayability if you manage to beat the normal main campaign (good luck).

Sound and Graphics
The graphics are pixel graphics and though I do enjoy the ‘old-school’ feel to them sometimes I have trouble seeing some things clearly, especially the larger the screen I play it on. 
The soundtrack is truly fantastic though! Instead of what you’d expect of a normal zombie survival game it takes an upbeat approach instead and the juxtaposition is fantastic. The whole package has a very nice retro feel to it and brings back some nostalgic feelings of the games on older consoles.

Pros
--- Randomized events, survivors and locations for replayability.
--- Local Co-Op so your friends can help you smash some zombies.
--- Fantastic soundtrack.
--- Difficult yet rewarding gameplay.
--- Customizability with survivors you can create yourself to encounter when you play. 
--- Various game modes
--- Awesome soundtrack (yet not available for purchase )-: )
---GNOMEY.

Cons
--- Full controller support yet instructions are keyboard keys only.
--- No achievements?!?!?!?!
--- Sieges can be a real pain in the...foot. Some are just a little too difficult.

Summary
Death Road To Canada to put it plainly is a great game with a hell of a lot of fun to be had. The randomization and various game-modes adds a great deal of replayability and the fact you can customize the game and add your own characters gives it a great feel. There's plenty of content included and for the hours of gameplay you’ll get out of it the price is more than fair. If you’re not willing to part with the cash right now it’s still a must buy during one of the Steam sales."

												Death Road to Canada is a game about controlling a car full of jerks as they ♥♥♥♥ up literally everything from Florida to Canada.

If you're a fan of games that are unforgiving at the slightest mistake, you should get this. If you lose your car, you lose the game.

Pro Tip: Make custom characters that you'll be comfortable with. There'll be situations where you can talk your way out, or you'll have to fight your way out of.

Pro Tip 2: There's no shame in asking for help or going to the wiki. I know I said it before, but this game is UNFORGIVING."

That aside, some of my most fun adventures include being repeatedly kicked by moose, that time I was betrayed by a very unloyal dog and murdered in my sleep, the time my unloyal dog flipped out and attempted to rob a trader and was subsequently murdered...I could go on., but I'll save some of the random event surprises for people to experience on their own. And remember, losing is fun--if you can't agree with that statement and NEED to win, maybe this game isn't for you..."

												   Death Road to Canada is a phenomenal mix of all the zombie games you have played before with Oregon Trail which makes for the most fun zombie apocalypse game in years if ever. This game strips down all of the slower moving aspects of zombie survival into a concise and streamlined re-playable experience. 

   The player controls randomly generated or self-generated characters on a romp from Florida to Canada in hopes to find safe haven. Along the way, resources must be scavenged, zombies must be crushed, allies need to be rescued or recruited, and hope to god the car doesn’t break down along the way.

Strengths:
•	The gameplay is just pure fun. Fast and Frantic with a bit of strategic maneuvering required when things get really hairy.
•	The RPG elements bring personality to each of the characters, and each specialization feels powerful enough to warrant a diverse group of zombie survivors. Just be sure to keep everyone as happy as possible or they might leave at the worst possible moment!
•	The random events are both funny and enjoyable, with a bit of rage inducing as well to keep things nice and balanced towards a harder difficulty.
•	Local co-op makes for a great addition, but what is even better, playing alone is just as fun. The AI allies are not just mindless drones, they will loot, replace their weapons and crack zombie skulls with precision.
•	The production values are extremely high, visuals are top notch, music is fantastic, and the UX is streamlined and easy to navigate and use. The game also tends to throw useful events your way if you happen to be SOL in a particular resource.

Weaknesses:
•	The lack of an online or four player option makes me a sad panda.
•	The pendulum of “Doing Well” to “Dead Meat” can swing extremely quickly. One moment you are doing fine, and the next day you are left with nothing because the car broke down.

Overall Death Road to Canada is the survival game I didn’t even know I needed in my life. Sometimes after playing hundreds of hours in Project Zomboid or State of Decay, it is nice to just have a bit of fun smashing zombies, collecting loots, and driving towards the Maple Leaf State. I see myself playing this game for months in hopes to unlock all of the different modes and characters, easily the best fifteen dollars spent in a long while.

												One More For The Road
When I first saw this game before release, I thought it was ok.
After the Dog Release Trailer, I was very intrigued.
Then Vinny from Vinesauce and his ""virtual-self who will never see Canada due to everything killing him"" sold it for me.

     I love this game. This game, without a doupt, has that ""One more go and I'll stop but you keep playing"" hold on you. The combat reminds me of Dark Souls where you must pace yourself. The music is catchy and will put you in a good mood no matter how bad your day IRL was. The comedic outcomes of events are fantastic, showing that this whole journey is for the fun then for the zombie drama. The characters will always make you laugh with the stupid stuff they get into, even in death. It's just wonderful.

     The game has a few flaws but nothing a patch won't fix like AI characters geting stuck juggling duplicate weapons on the ground, items on Y'all Mart shelfs not being clearly visiable for picking up, not knowing what day it is (looking at you Monday) and not being able to ""Always Be Looting"" whenever you wish. Overall, this game worth every can of food. If I were to suggest a few things to add to this game-

3DS/Vita Ports
I need this on the go, please!

4 Player Online/MMO Co-Op
2 Player Local Co-Op is nice but I don't have anyone to play with. Online would help. While your at it, bump it up to 4 players for more mayhem. Prehaps while playing Online we may bump into another player who needs help and team up for a bit.

Rare Character Select and More Rare Characters
I feel once a rare character is found, you should be able to play as them when starting up a new game, but only in the mode they were found in. (i.e Found Lank in Rare Mode, Lank is playable in all Rare Mode Options.) The current selection of Rare Characters is hillarious but we need more; like Doomguy, Issac, Mayro, Sanic, Puc-Man, The L4D and Dead Island Survivors, the Protect-Me Knights/Gotta Protectors, Fazbear & Friends, Robbie Rotten, and more!

More Rare Rides
Just more please. I could list so many; The Time Travaling DeLorean, Mad Max's Machine, Classic Ecto 1, The Bat Mobile, Santa's Sleigh, Cars from Wacky Racers, TF2 Sniper's Camper Van, The Flintstone's Car, Thomas the Tank Engine's Bertie Bus (Hell thrown in Thomas as well cause why not?), and more! 

No Hitch-hikers Allowed Mode
Pick 1-4 characters and they will be the only ones you can play with.

USA Tour Mode
Tour ALL 50 States before reaching Canada. Starting in Florida and ending in Alaska; To Canada or Bust.

More Custom Character Options
More Heads, Hairs, Skin tones, Body sizes, Misc, Clothing, Perks, Save slots, and more please! Also, Saveable Stats, Choice of starting weapon, and an option for Rare Perks earned by Rare Characters (or least they bump a perk up to 4 stars).

More Animals
I wanna see more crazy animals to team up with or even ride. Ask Jontron if his ""Robotic bird"" Jacques can be put in to shoot zombies with his lazor beam eyes.

More Zambies
Don't take that too literal, I'm more refering to more looks and even ""Speical Infected"". Custom Zombie Maker, maybe?

Level Editor
An option to make our own maps that may randomly generate into the mix of places to visit.


Seriously, worth every can of food so far, keep up the good work."

												Started the game off by creating my family (dad,mum,brother,nan,uncle and ME!!!!)
Turns out im not good at surviving and i was swiftly killed while trying to work out how the game worked.
My brother was still left though so i went on an adventure!
......And was then pinned down in a ""survive the horde"" sort of game.
Then i found my golf loving dad at a driving range wielding a golf club. 
Things were looking up!
I even replaced a persons head with a pugs head...... because you can do that in this game so why not XD
Then eventually all of the group died when they were left carless and were attempting to get another one.

In summary:
THIS GAME IS AWESOME!"

												This game is like Oregon Trail meets Zombies Ate My Neighbors. (oh that's been said before? well, it's still true) and I think I REALLY like it.

I'll get the Cons & Pros out of the way, first.

CONS:it's perma-death.
meaning you may get attached to awesome characters only to have him or her or EVERYONE die. :D

the RNG on text encounters. Sometimes the RNG will seem unfair & that's just how it is with these games. Make a choice that has a 50/50 chance of being good or terrible. Oh no. Lookit, a character died 'cause the game told me she/he did.

""Doors and how they can kill you"" - how doors work is only 1st player (lead role) can go through doors to go to the next room. This would be fine, BUT if 2nd player isn't immediately next to you, a delay is put in before 2nd player appears at the next doorway. In theory it's good, but it quickly becomes frustrating when you realize ""Oh no. 2nd player was 2 steps behind me and now I just killed them."" :SNEUTRALSit's so good you'll almost always get that 'just one more time' feeling when & if you die.

family friendly -(could be a pro or a con) nothing inappropriate; NO cursing, excessive gore, or 'suggestive' talkPROS: (too many to list, but I'll try) 2 Player Co-Op! -drop-in/drop-out cooperative play at any time. (fun tip: 2nd Player can choose which party member to play as when dropping in on a playable encounter - ie: town, swarm event, etc.)

Cool character creator -sure, it may be retro pixelated graphic style, but there are enough customization options to generally make characters that look mostly like anyone you know.

64 character slots -save & use your own custom characters; can set as the 2 starting characters OR as possible recruits. 

different modes -3 modes are unlocked from the start. more can be unlocked as you play the game and do certain things. Each mode has different rules for which characters you will meet. (note: play familiar mode if you want your team to meet ONLY custom characters)

great soundtrack (that reminds me of music from Metropolismania [PS2 game, released 2002] for some reason)

Fun for the whole family & funny -in text narration, character dialogue, and some animations & references

references (I won't spoil) to at least a few things from your childhood and/or 90's/early 2000s era.

RNG: never knowing what characters you're going to run into

SAVE AND QUIT! - the game doesn't make this feature super obvious, BUT if you quit the game, then the current game session will be saved at the point of the last town /playable encounter. Awesome, considering each game session varies in length

H I G H Replay Value. due to random encounters, random characters, and randomly generated levels -all varied enough to keep it interesting through dozens of hours of playthroughs (probably even more)

nuances of strategy: shut doors behind you, carry up to 3 weapons, choosing roles & weapons before each playable encounter...these are all things that did NOT need to be in the game, but their inclusion gives DRtC much more strategy and depth
CLOSINGI can't put into words how great this game is. You NEED IT NOW.
Play it with family. Play it with friends.♠ It will make you laugh and maybe even feel nostalgic. Don't let the ""rogue-like"" label scare you off. It's well worth any frustrations. 



9/10 > > > Great game. Almost perfect.





-----
♠ Also, play it all by yourself :( *insert joke about morale going down*... :D

edit 1 (12-01-16): fixed formatting of lists
edit 2 (12-09-16): fixed typo on 'nuances of strategy' under PROS
edit 3 (12-10-16): added 'family friendly' under Neutrals; added '64 character slots', '2 Player Co-Op' under Pros; reworded title and description for 'Save and Quit'
e4 (12-22-16): reworded description of 'Save and Quit' to be more clear and concise
e5 (12-27-16): added con ""Doors & how they can kill you"" (might even say it hit me like a ton of zombies at a doorway)
e6 (02-20-17): changed wording on '64 character slots'; &added bullet point of 'different modes'"

												Saw some gaming YouTube channels I regularly watch play it, thought it was cool (especially since I'm fond of roguelikes), and added it to my wishlist on Steam and kind of forgot about it. 

Cue Autumn sale. Decided to buy it. Let it sit in my library for about a week or so before deciding to play.

All I can say is this: WOW.

Right from the start, it's pretty damn good. Nothing says ""awesome"" like slashing through zombies while going north (Though a zombie apocalypse seems more like an average day in Florida anyways). Sure, I haven't had too many runs so far, but they were surprisingly kind of intense. Every death sucks, especially in the times where I've gotten so far, but that's roguelikes for you, and that's why I love them.

Also, I'm Alexandra the resilient martial artist with a kitchen knife. Can't beat that."

												Death Road To Canada is an action rpg that has alot of charm and reminded me of a modern Oregon Trail game. You have some very tough decisions to make on you're journey to Canada that really effect the game and there are also some sections that have action oriented gameplay and zombies all over the place, the game can get brutal!

Don't let the cute, old school pixel style graphics fool you, it is very challenging and will keep you on you're toes at all times. The dialogue is well written, the game is very funny and random events are all very well done.

You have to manage you're group of people as you try and make it from Florida to Canada. Like Oregon Trail before it, you must manage many things, including fuel, weapons, guns and food. One aspect I love, that I mentioned above is some of the tough choices you have, which remind me of a good rpg. 

Each game has been very different so far and I can see a good amount of replay value to this game. Did I mention make you're decisions wisely? Sometimes things as small as letting someone join you're group, to going to find loot and losing one or all of you're group members.

Sometimes the vehicle will break down, if one of you're characters is a mechanic they can fix it, if you get jumped by bandits you must make the decision to pass over of you're hard each food/gas/ammo to the bandits or attack them. All of the random events and choices are very welll written to and alot of the time are very hard choices that take a little while to decide what you want to pick. 

You will also have to pick weither to stop and check out some houses or stores along you're way, sure it would be nice to get some more food, ammo or gas but at what cost? You might get jumped by the zombies and it could all end there. Do you check out the city or keep driving and going to the next one? 

If you have a friend or family member around you can also get them to hop in at times and control one of you're gorup members. One aspect I wish this game had was coop for people that are not in the same house. Local coop is cool but boy would this be fun with friends from other countries or cities. The other aspect I had some issues with was the crashes, I had 4 or 5 crashes during my many hours on the game. And lastly, the controls for keyboard and mouse could be improved, thankfully it handles flawless with a controller.

Still the good far outweigh the bad as Death Road To Canada brings a wonderful new, zombie style take on the Oregon Trail formula and does most of it very very well. The writing is top notch, the game has a ton of charm, the gameplay is fun, you have tough choices to make and it has good replay value.  This is a game that I find really good for an hour at a time and I can see myself playing much more over the next year. A few minor issues didn't take away from  the enjoyment I had while playing this game. Each time you restart it feels like a new experience, interested to see what new things the developers add in the future. 

Get ready for a hell of a ride with Death Road To Canada! Oh yeah, one last thing, never let a clown in you're vehicle if you see one on the side of the road!

**I got a copy of this game to review from the developers. This is the rough draft of the review, the final/edited version will be up on the website sometime this week or next week**"

												In the short time that I've spent with it (singular run thus far), I can tell you that DRTC is a delightful title. Part choose-your-own-adventure, part pixel brawler, part zombie survival, DRTC is an ingenous blend of terror, amazing 16-bit banjo music and maple syrup."

												8.5/10 game, 5/10 gameplay
This game isn't even RNG, the game director does everything it can to make it impossible for you to win. Extreme difficulty can be fun, but only if the difficulty can be overcome by enough skill.

I had the dream team of 2, a dog and a human, the dog was max intellect (to the point of being able to use a gun), and we had a fast car with 200 gas, 15 food, great weapons etc and the human decided to leave the death road while at NEUTRAL positivity, leaving the dog. Immiedietly after that, i was stuck in a 2 hour hoard in a mall, with so many zombies that the doors were blocked off with no possible escape while the room was quickly filling up, nothing to throw or anything. There was no decicion i could of made earlier in my gameplay that could of prevented that death.

With that out of the way, the gameplay you DO get before being excecuted is fun, plus the soundtrack is dank 

I'm only recommending this game to protect myself from a hundred fanboys that will swarm any negative comment about any game they play, and for anyone who likes getting hecked with a cactus over and over beause they enjoy the game up to that point"

												-it was an average day. or so i thought.
-zombies invaded our town so i knew i had to escape to a place with no zombies, canada.
-i took a long a buddy named greg with me to canada. greg was a great  mechanic and doctor so i knew he'd be  perfect
-all was going well, we looted several places, stocked up on food, gas, and medical equipment
-along the road i spotted a dog. i recruited the dog, raliegh, to the team as we had more then enough food
-raleigh was extremely trustworthy and we used him to bride bandits and what not
-we continue our trek to canada, fending off hordes of zombies whilst collecting loots
-we then met peter on the side of the street alone
-knowing we had alot of food we thought another person wouldnt hurt us
-hes a fighter, lets recruit him they said
-look how big he is they said
-he'll be perfect they said
-so we allowed peter to join even though i really did not want to
-none the less he was a fighter and a warrior, and he really helped out the team
-or so we thought
-i began to get excited, as we had plenty of supplies and only 4 days left
-i began to trsut peter, and knowing he was a good shot, i gave him a gun
-and that was all good
-but what happened next will haunt me for the rest of my life
-we ran into a town, and in a house the was a grenade
-at the time i had never used a grenade, so  igave it to peter
-and that was the worst mistake of my life
-the next time we encountered a horde, and just as it looked like we deafeted it, we had not
-peter, who i had begun to trust had turned sides, a traitor as some may say
-he threw the grenade right at all of our feet
-he had instantly killed himself and greg, and severly injured me and raleigh
-flashbacks began to cross my mind of my vietnam days
-me and raleigh believed petercould have been apart of isis
-as we sit there half dead the zombies began to enclosure us
-me and raleigh could not escapeand had died

10/10 would trust an isis member again

												First run of the game.

be playing as character Nanc, and her buddy who is a doctor guy.
shortly after setting out, a bee flies into the window of the car and won't leave.
doctor guy tries to kill it, dies instantly from bee sting.
spend most of the early journey alone, until Nanc meets a fisherman guy who only speaks in fishes.
later meet a doctor girl, and a big tough guy. go on lots of daring adventures and close calls with the three of them.
one day we are robbed by bandits, and big guy intimidates them by saying he'll burn down their bridge. they let us go and he burns down their bridge anyway.
later things start going bad, and doctor girl gets peeved. so she bullies big guy out of our group. sad times ahead.
car is out of gas and we trying to get a new one. find one but have to get keys from nearby cabin. very full of zombies.
too many zombies even with guns, and they overwhelm us. Nanc runs to grab keys and then runs for the car, but fisherman is left behind.
see him being devoured as me and doctor lady drive away. his corpse distracted the zombies enough for us to escape.
mean doctor lady starts bullying me, and causing problems. she has a meltdown and runs off.
Nanc is all alone again, with only a little gas and some ammo. but only 4 days to Canada now.
see two survivors need help. use what little ammo i have to help them escape giant horde.
they don't want to join. instead offer useless mechanical training.
car runs out of gas and have to walk, but there's still hope. only 2 more days until Canada.
get attacked by a cat. it doesn't do a lot of damage but makes Nanc feel bad.
Nanc performs first aid on herself. not very good at it, because doctors always did it.
Nanc kills herself attempting to heal cat wounds. game over.

												Her name was Ora, she was a dog, and this is her tail...*baddum tst*

I rescued Ora from a zombie infested apartment building, Ora had placed a banner out front which read ""Bark! Bark!"" Clearly a cry for help.

Ora became an invaluable member of the team, more than pulling her weight in combat, picking up grenades, and outting me for farting in the car via an extremely complex deductive process. However the defining victory of Ora was when heavily armed bandits and their totally not Immortan Joe leader had blocked the road before us and demanded all our food, weapons, supplies, and even our car! Ora had a plan, Ora always  had a plan. Ora proceeded to honk the horn, which amused the bandits to no end upon seeing an animal doing that. They let us through unharmed, we celebrated by robbing a lone trader.

Our merry band of jerks was not too stay bonded forever. We had stopped at a non-descript town to scavange for supplies, the zombies were out thick that day and so we had to do a lot more smashing, shooting, and running than usual. By the time we had picked the town clean it was swarming like a bee hive on Honey Day and we were firing all our guns to get out. In the Chaos I lost sight of Ora....I didn't notice her absence until we were in the car and pulling away...the last image I have of her is seared in my mind, valiantly wielding a golf club, hundreds of zombies closing in...

We died horribly just south of the border, and we deserved it for leaving Ora behind..

10/10 would purchase Melton the Cat from a witch for 15 hamburgers again."

												This is a really fun game, especially for what it seems like on the surface. Both the pixel art and the zombies are done with enough charm and care that I enjoyed ever single event! The Rare Characters mode is also a treat, as an already-lighthearted game swerves into gleeful absurdity at times. This is a fantastic way to spend a few hours at a time!"

												This is based off of a true story.

Everything was fine. Kiara, Rosaline, and their dog, Billy, were cruising down the Death Road to Canada. They had over 200 gas, over 30 food, 20 medical kits, and more ammo and weapons than they know what to do with. They were a happy family, eating marshmallows and telling scary stories around the fire.
Then... everything changed when the group of bandits attacked.
Kiara was killed. But that wasn't the worst part. The dog was killed. Sweet little Billy. Struck down in his prime. Rosaline was all alone.
So she traveled on. The car broke down. She walked alone, through the rain. She didn't have time to mourn the lost of her dearest friends... her only friends. Then, when all hope was gone, while looting an apartment, Rosaline found a dog, Jeanette. She adopted Jeanette and they traveled onwards.
The two comrades happened upon a junkyard that had a decent car. At the junkyard was another dog that joined them in their new car. Jeanin was one of them now. Their family was growing. They were all smiles and laughs. Jeanette loved to stick her fluffy doggy head out the window.
And another dog, Virginia, found them on the road and joined them! Rosalin was surrounded by sweet, loving, zombie-killing dogs. What more could she ask for?
But one apartment... there were too many zombies. Rosalin was seperated from her beloved dog. She slashed at the rotting zombies with her rusty machete but she was too tired. Her arms went limp at her side as she felt teeth rip into her flesh. She looked at Jeanette one last time... her last breath was a single, whispering word:
""Canada.""
The fluffy little dog gathered up her friends, her comrades, her family, and fled the apartment, leaving behind the skeleton of her beloved master. With that one word echoing in her mind, Jeanette jumped in the front seat of the car and taught herself to drive. They were going to get to Canada.
The three dogs fought and fought for over a week. They battled their ways through sieges, through swarms, through factories, through grocery stores, through the skeletons of the hundreds of humans who had died in their journey to Canada. So many had died. But these little dogs were making it.
They were less than two days away. They stopped at a trading camp one last time. The traders took pity on the three dogs and gave them some free ammo. The dogs were eterneally grateful.
But Rosalin had had all the guns.
The dogs didn't have any guns.
One last stop before reaching Canada.
They were trapped in a house.
It was a siege. They just had to survive long enough and then escape.
Zomies were raining from the ceilings, flooding through the door as a flood of death and gore. No other human had ever gotten this far before. Not even close. But these dogs. These brave dogs, Jeanette, Jeanin, Virginia... they had done what no other human had done. They had gotten to Canada.
Almost.
Jeanette was the first to die as she desperately tried to lead the pack of zombies away from her comrades and from the door which would soon be open. But the house was too small. She was overwhelmed.
Jeanin took over. Sweet little Virginia was being overwhelmed. Jeanin ran in, batting the zombie away, scratching and biting them to protect Virginia, who was quickly becoming tired. Jeanin succeeded in her goal, but only after she died.
Virginia. She was all alone. The zombies were busy feasting upon the carcasses of Jeanette and Jeanin. Virginia ran towards the door. The siege wasn't over but it was almost time for that blessed door to be free. She would be ready.
But the zombies were far more ready than she was.
They were waiting right outside the door and came rushing in to greet her. Virginia fought her way to the door and tried to leave.
""It is unsafe to go outside right now.""
She couldn't leave. Not yet. She tried to run away. She fought and fought and fought... but it was all for naught. She was less than a foot away from the exit.
The zombies circled her and Virginia's body fell to the floor as they bit and scratched her. Her blood was ripped out from her veins and her limbs were devoured by the growling mass of zombies. As her soul slowly left her eyes, she could see one last sign...
""The siege is over. It's safe to go outside.""
One day away.
One driving day away from Canada.
Almost.

10/10 would get a pack of dogs to drive a car to Canada again."

												This game will f&$% you up. You need to have the holy power of the RNG to survive. Now, that does not make this a bad game, it makes it realistic, for a zombie apocalypse anyways. I started off with two people. All was going well, then we met another guy, and we let him join. Then, a seige happened. A seige is where you have to hold out long enough before escaping, which can last a while. My original partner died. Blah Blah Blah anime katanas, blah blah blah Prius, and we find a girl, and let her join. Blah Blah Blah Raiders, Blah Blah Blah Supermarket, another seige. Now this time, there's two other people trapped in here with us, a police officer, and what looked like a scientist. My guy was the only survivor, after we all got cornered, and I was the only person who tried to run through the zombies, instead of fighting them. So I drive for a while longer, nobody else shows, supplies are running low, and I find this car, which looks like it has supplies. Aaaaaand the keys are missing. I walk around the surrounding area ducking and weaving, trying to find the keys, and then I find this log cabin, which is overrun with ZED, I try to run inside, but get pinned in a corner, like those I had left behind, and I died fighting. So yeah, amazing brand new game, go play it now."

												I started out with just a couple of randos, eventually met an Elvis impersonator who was so good at karate he didn't need weapons, then met myself and found out I was an enormous jackass. Along the road we  had to deal with loads of bandits, got really beefy, and charmed a dog into giving us free bullets. Unfortunately we all died at the Canadian border shortly after kicking the first member of the team out for being a grade-A dink.

Rocketcat's made another great game, and finally one that you can play on something other than a phone."

												 Follow the Death Road 
Death Road to Canada is one of those games where you cant stop playing it, almost like going out to a restaruant you really enjoy... but instead of eating food to appeal your appetite you're playing a videogame. I first heard of this game when a YouTuber by the name of PBGGameplay made a halloween themed video about this game, and instantly I knew this was the game for me. The music is amazing and is the exact opposite of what I think a zombie game would have, it reminds me of an old super nintendo TMNT beat-em-up (the best kind of beat-em-up). The gameplay is fun and rewarding, you feel pretty good once you beat a super hard siege or come back from a location with more loot then normal you feel really good and confident. The re-playability is amazing and the different game modes and outcomes for events on the road like the UFO landing sight add so much content  and if you keep the alien alive till the end of the siege you get the UFO as a car . In the end  Death Road to Canada   is my favorite game of 2016, and definitely one of my favorite games of all time. Onward to canada!"

												 Target Audience:    Roguelike Action Fans

 Summary:   
Death Road To Canada is the essence of action roguelike gameplay: replayability, and yet simplicity with hidden layers of gameplay. While making your way to the land north of America, you'll be put into binds and situations that will force split-second decisions that can doom you. The mixture of the action gameplay along with the Oregon Trial like strategy gameplay works together rather well: as both end up enhancing the gameplay and choices of the other. And like a good roguelike: it's difficult, but manageable, forcing you to make difficult decisions that's not just there for show. It's the risk and reward mechanics that shine here: really rewarding you in pushing as far as your team can go without breaking, but punishing you heavily if you push too far. 
Sure, you're going to struggle with some of the controls at first. But these are the right kind of “inaccurate” controls: controls that complement the gameplay in question. The only major problem I have with the game is the crashes (which is being addressed by the developer), and the AI can be REALLY dumb at times, getting itself killed rather easily. But if you like anything in the roguelike genre mixed with action, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not picking up Death Road To Canada. It'll probably be on my “underrated games of the year” list, as it's not going to get the mainstream attention that it should. But you should give it your attention.

 Lists: 
Positives:
 Keeps the pressure on. Once you get past the first few days, you're feeling every battle. Resources are a godsend, and you'll never feel comfortable. 
 A great example of a good risk/reward system. Pushing your team to its edge in getting resources before the night comes, but pushing too far will usually hurt your team and maybe get it killed. 
 Smart decision making is rewarded. Understanding your teams strengths, and what option to choose based on it, will result in the appropriate outcome 90% of the time. There's just enough RNG added here to make things interesting, without making you feel like you're not in control. 
 Morale system in particular is actually implemented with some thought put behind it, and makes a difference when trying to go further and further. 
 You'll have to make hard decisions. Actual hard decisions. Not decisions that actually don't mean jack ♥♥♥♥ in the end. Like “Choose between these two characters. One goes away.” 
 Combat may be simple, but it's effective. It's about space management, and forces the player to think about how they can escape a room without losing anyone. It may be repetitive: but it's the good kind of repetitive. It's more about strategy and smart decisions made. 
 Some nice alternate weaponry that serves a specific purpose, like the cardboard tube. This gives you more reasons to vary up your arsenal. 
 Use of the environment is rewarded. Walking into a room with 50 zombies, only to yell “NOPE” and close the door behind you actually rewards you if you can get out without them noticing. Forcing enemies to bite through furniture can give you the space you need in order to deal with hordes.  
 I like the control set for the most part here, even if it can be unwieldy at times. The thing is, it complements the combat and the tone that the gameplay is going for. You're not supposed to be a super Walking Dead gunslinger. You're just bob from the local diner. It will actually take some time and experience in order to actually be a bad ♥♥♥.
 It's always fun to run across the different popular media and video game characters in the world they've created here. Adding Octodad to the team? Yeah, I dig it. 
 It's that goofy kind of realism. There's feral cats, Zombies, aliens, and gators you wrestle. And yet, for some reason, you think this is reasonable given the universe, and can see it happen. Oh, and the whole Octodad thing. 
Negatives:
 As of right now, I've had several crashes, but the developer is diligently working to solve the problems in question. Note that Windows 10 users may need to be weary of it.
 Your AI partners can be.....very very dumb. Walking into zombies without any thought process what so ever if you get even the least bit separated. 
 Wanted to see a button dedicated to switch characters. Would have made things a lot smoother in terms of using that feature. 
 Some of the randomness of the weapon degradation can be annyoing, because you really don't know what some of your weapons conditions are. 
 The visual style just doesn't help the game out in the end. It's got a lot of customization and elements that would be taken to the next level if it had the visual elements behind it."

												My group of ragtag misfits had made it all the way to Canadian border until the party's bruiser had gotten the smart idea to throw molotovs at the approaching wall of zombies.  Shortly after this he realized his mistake as the conflagrating waves of undead set fire to not only himself but his other friends, including a luchador who spent his last breath piledriving a zombie into the hostile crowds.  

As all four friends lay burning in the snow like the Earth immolating at the edge of a supernova, their last sight on this cursed world was that of a giant mech dressed as a Canadian Mountie singing, ""O' Canada"""

												My favorite thing to do in this game is make tons of custom characters of everyone I know, online and offline. There's a gameplay mode that prioritizes your custom characters. It makes for a lot of fun, running into everyone you know in the game and seeing their horrible or sometimes awesome fate."

												It started out as an adventure of my friend, Nic, and I to Canada. We've known each other since we were small. Together we survived some pretty prickly situations and we met a few friends along the way, Rusty and Jacinda. 

We were a rag tag group of survivors content on the idea of making it to Canada. Things were looking great but unfortunately that didn't last long. We had lost our car and were forced to trek on foot. 

After what seemed to be an eternity, we spotted a cabin and a van that resembled a dog. After fighting through the horde of zombies, we managed to find the keys. We struggled to make it back to the van, but we were on our way to Canada once again!

We all were in need of rest after the all the excitement we had endured during the day so we had found an empty house along the roadside. Night was falling upon us, as leader, I appointed Jacinda to barricade duty. This was a fatal decision on my part as leader. I may not have been perfect but I always seemed to keep us on top. Night had fallen and we were surrounded by zombies. With Jacinda's lackluster job, they had been able to break in and we had lost Nic and Rusty. Jacinda and I had narrowly escaped with our lives. 

Bitter towards Jacinda, I knew ultimately it was my decision which had led to the death of my childhood friend, Nic, and our beloved teammate, Rusty. Even after these events, we couldn't forget our initial goal of this journey. It was to make it to Canada. The sacrifice of our friend's could not be in vain. Once again, we pushed on.

Low on supplies and down to just the two of us, we decided to enter a nearby town to gear up. The rain helped muffle our sounds enough to push past the large packs of angry and aggressive zombies. We found a house with enough supplies to last us the remainder of our trip. Now we just needed to get back to our van.

On our way out the door, we noticed the large packs had moved to the outside of the house we were in, and sadly, we were spotted. We had tried to stand our ground, but were quickly overwhelmed and were forced to run. Making a mad dash to our van, we had gotten ourselves surrounded. 

It was in that moment that Jacinda had taken her hatchet and started fighting and pushing her way through one side. Myself and a bloody and beaten Jacinda had managed to make it to the doorway of a small house. She was bitten all over and we both knew that it was over for her. She told me to go inside without her. She said she was sorry but this is where her story ends. Reluctantly, I turned and closed the door.

Here I sit in this small house, alone and waiting for my impending doom while I write this letter. Moans and sounds of limbs banging against the door. I feel at peace.

10/10 Simulator for when 'murica falls because of the Trumpster. Would die travelling to Canada again."

												This is a GREAT game. It is fun to play by yourself but it is better with friends. The only few problems I have with it are: there is no 4 player multiplayer, sometimes the cpu helping you will just stand there, and no online multiplayer but that is it. This game has to be one of the better games i have played in a while. The best way to play it though is to make friends then play familiar people mode. I don't have many hours on this game because I prefer playing with friend to guard your back."

												Great game, distinct from The Organ Trail despite the same overall concept. This is more of a frenzied sprint rather than The Organ Trail's marathon - instead of distance, you have 15 days of driving from Florida to Canada. You need gas, food, and whatever you can get your hands on. Good luck, godspeed, try not to die.

Exploring points of interest makes up a majority of the gameplay and is very action oriented. You can choose who goes out, and then the scavenging party goes of to a randomly generated SNES style action map level, very distinct from OT's EGA emulation. 

Shooting zombies was the main defense in OT. While that's an option here, there's a huge emphasis on melee, knocking down enemies, and mobility - running past zombies RE style is usually your best option when scavenging. You and your buddies can die out there, you do not immediately get sent back to safety OT style after zombie contact. It actually takes being cornered or prolonged zombie contact to die, though, hence the mobility emphasis.

The only real complaint I have is that some mechanics may be initially obtuse, though you will probably be okay with this if you are a fan of rogue-likes that do similar things. For example, stats are hidden until you use them, which can be quite frustrating if you make assumptions or are gambling wildly on skills. I can't really say it's a negative as it does become more apparent over time who is good at what, or if you just make custom characters, but beware if it's your first time out!

In summary: good gameplay that's more active and engaging. Lots of game modes, easy to get in and out of, quite funny, great music, and gives me an odd River City Ransom vibe when scavenging, especially with some ai partners or better yet a second local player along.

Final note:
For the love of god, if you find a man dressed as Garfield, DO NOT TAKE HIM ALONG. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID. HE IS THE ANGEL OF DEATH AND MONDAYS."

												Disclaimer: I received this pre-release copy from backing the original Kickstarter.

Death Road To Canada is Oregon Trail. That's all it is. It's a weird simplified Oregon Trail-esque game with modern comedy writing and wacky events in lieu of normal strategic planning and ""realistic"" events like injuries and diseases. Now, you may be thinking, ""Isn't this just Organ Trail? Why do we need multiple games for this one extremely niche market?"" First of all, why don't we need multiple games, second of all, what we've got here is a pretty solid game.

There are two phases to the game: traveling and the choices you make on the road, and scavenging for supplies on the open road. Traveling works the way any similar random game works, be it Oregon Trail or FTL or Convoy or whatever. You will find rest places or bandits or teammates on the open road, and decide who to barter with, what to trust, who to tell to COOL IT (from personal experience, there's basically never a reason to tell anyone to COOL IT, which is a shame). The scavenging, in my opinion, is where the real heart of the game lies. Here you are in full control, weaving past hordes of the undead and rummaging through any house you can find in search of food, gas, health, ammo, and the occasional weapon. Combat is a last resort, as ammo is limited and all weapons have a chance of breaking (the AI apparently did not get this memo, as it will move to smack any zombie that comes within smacking distance, even if all they have at their disposal is an old umbrella or a femur). House maps are generated from random rooms, whose floor plans defy the laws of known physics with rooms that overlap each other and lead to god knows where. It's silly. It takes getting used to.

Of course, any game following in the old footsteps of good old ""terrible death is educational"" will stumble onto the same problems as its predecessors: everything is left to the whims of the RNG, and the RNG hates your stupid surviving face. If your team has high morale, whoops, here's an event that drops everyone's morale. Got a surplus of food? Be a shame if some bandits were to get in your way. What's that? You have a car with gas? What do you think this is, Daytona USA? Sometimes while you're driving, characters will just argue with each other and lower their morale. Having an RNG that doesn't basically cheat certainly isn't easy, but typically there's some kind of middle ground. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure erred on the side of ""too easy"", though primarily that was due to gameplay being more based on skill than luck. In Death Road To Canada, the skill-based sections are enjoyable, but the luck-based ones are just a reminder to properly lubricate before making your decision.

I do have to give this game props where it's due: for a zombie game, it does a good job at making a proper zombie atmosphere. The zombies are many and travel in hordes, and there's a thick VHS film grain that covers the screen giving it a classic Romero graphic look. (And yes, it can be turned off.) The one real surprising outlier is the music, which for whatever reason is some arcadey honky-tonk that adds to the game's ""quirkiness"", and if that's the kinda word that makes your stomach crawl up your esophagus, you might as well look elsewhere. The whole game's about being quirky, from constant references to being ""swole"" to the ability to play as a car-driving dog. This here is the silly version of Organ Trail, that's the name it's made for itself and that's how I enjoy it. (I mean, enjoying is sort of a relative term. I enjoy it as long as the game allows me to enjoy it before throwing me into a ditch and stealing my ♥♥♥♥.)


Bottom line: this game is a game of Russian Roulette at some twisted carnival with the biggest teddy bear if you last five rounds. It's a twelve inch novelty ♥♥♥♥♥, and it's made of cubes because this game has a quirky pixel art style. And if you're the kind of masochistic thrill seeker who's into that stuff, then this is a fine way to spend your evening."

												Death Road to Canada is an amazing game where you attempt to take a car full of jerks to the Canadian border so they can live out their blissful existence free from the American zombies. Along the way, you'll find talking dogs, kawaii Anime girls, and a buttload of other crazy characters that make the game ridiculously entertaining. There is a lot of replay value and though I haven't tried co-op yet, that seems quite entertaining as well. I'd like to include an anecdote, but instead I'll just list a few things that have happened to me in this game in the few hours I've played it:

[SOME SPOILERS]
-Had a character possesed by a Demon
-Met an Alien who helped us blast through undead
-Had a character die because they attempted to pull out a loose tooth
-Had a moose chuckle at my characters, then kill them
-Told too many people to ""cool it""
-Opened way too many toilets, expecting too much each time
-Had my dreams of reaching Canada destroyed before my eyes 

I've yet to reach Canada (my most recent playthrough was my closest, with my Demon-Possesed Debutante reaching the final mission before becoming zombie chow) so it is challenging but after a brief break, I always return to the game, telling myself that I will make it ""this time.""

EDIT: After 14 hours, I finally made it to Canada with my custom character (Hank) and a whole lotta luck.

8/10 Recommended."

												I made my best friend and myself. We were killin it. We found two dogs, a poodle we didn't trust named Peyton, and a Husky we loved named Veer. We walked into a fancy house and we both died. Veer took over. He drove Peyton around barking at wildlife and drooling. They found my boyfriend on the side of the road playing video games and picked him up. He died right away. Veer dies as well trying to save him. He was a good dog. Peyton is the only one left. I still didn't trust him. He finds OctoDad on the side of the road, he finally gets in the car. They go to a junkyard for gas and Octodad dies. Then Peyton dies on the way out. Doesn't surprise me everyone dies and Peyton was left. 10/10 for suspcious dogs."

												Let me tell you a story about a guy and a random dog he found in a ditch.

Girlymaaaaaaaaaan (Named after an akward time back in college when he looked like the Bootleg Michael Jackson) was driving to canada in his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hybrid car with 2 expendable ♥♥♥♥♥ in the trunk, then 1 day when they we´re driving like usual, a feral ♥♥♥♥ing mut replaces one of the expendable dudes.
After that the dog (now named Smith) does jackshit and lets his new comrades die. Then 1 fatal day when he let´s the last Humie (GIRLYMAAAAAAAAAAAN) die, he steals the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hybrid car and starts driving, shooting, trading, farting in the car and wandering who the hell did it even tough he´s the only being in the car.
Then one day smith desides to have a little humanity and help some dudes in a shootout and ends up being shot and killed.
R.I.P Smith the dog, a true deathroad survivor. PS. 10/10 whould leave Bootleg Michael Jackson die in a cottage again."

												 On the Death Road, Casey the Surgeon and Spelunky Guy the Explorer were traveling in their car they had obtained after helping an alien fight a siege of zombies.

Along with their Bodybuilder friend, they travel along almost reaching New York. Until they are stopped after they learn the D*A*N*G*E*R   R*A*N*G*E*R*S, and the unfortunate situation they had gotten themselves into to.

After saving them and being blessed by Blue's pep talk, Green's swole tips, Orange's fitness training, and Pink healing wisdom; they found Vinny from Vinesauce, along with a gnome they found on the side of the road.

In a unfortunate siege, Bodybuilder, Vinny, and Gnome all bit the dust.

Without Spelunky Guy, which they booted out earlier, Casey traveled along the edge of New York almost to the border of Canada...

With chainsaw, pistol, and hatchet in hand; she prepared for the next 4 hour siege that would decide her fate...

Until she got stung and killed by a bee which flew into the car, after telling the bee, her final last words...

												I should probably mention that I've only played 8.7 hours and I've only ever played Familiar Characters Mode, so I haven't fully explored the game yet, but from what I've played, I can say it's one of my most favorite games of 2016. The gameplay is extremely fun and never seemed to grow boring, the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, and the graphics are brilliant. And even though I haven't played it as much recently, I still have the soundtrack stuck in my head. If you've played games like Oregon Trail or Super Amazing Wagon Adventure and enjoyed them, you will enjoy this. I recommend this game fully, I fail to see how anybody could hate this game after playing it. There are so many different modes which just adds more playability. I feel like there could be more customization, but for what they have right now is great. Overall a great game and definitely in my top 5 games for 2016, highly recommend for anybody."

												Just finished my best run yet:

Start off with me and a gentle giant karate master named Greg
Greg and I go a few days with no mishaps and collect lots of supplies
We find some Mary Poppins knockoff on the side of the road
Let Mary Poppins join us on our journey to Canada
We journey onwards until we encounter a siege in the sewers
Mary Poppins' umbrella weapon isn't putting a dent in the zombies and it looks like all is lost
Suddenly Greg unleashes his kung fu fury and kills multiple zombies with one punch
We barely make it out of the sewers and we continue on our way
Soon after we take a dog named Karin into our group
A few days go by with nothing too unusual happening
We then find a custom character based on my friend that I made earlier
Mary Poppins gets the boot and my friend joins the group
Our team of four carves a path of carnage on the remainder of the trip to Canada
We have tons of supplies, tons of gas, and tons of food
Nothing could go wrong
The second last siege happens
We make it out with no casualties
Then comes the last siege
It's four minutes long in an average sized city
Too many zombies
We run in and out of buildings looking for supplies
I find some grenades
I pick them up as my character but switch to Greg afterwards to switch out a weapon
Badchoice.png
Zombies pile into the building
We could have handled them easily and escaped the building
But my character decides to throw two of the three grenades at the horde
We're in a very small building
I switch back to my character and sprint out of the building
Karin runs out of the building with me
Greg and my friend weren't so lucky
It's just me and Karin left with three more minutes until we can enter Canada
Karin and I survive for quite a while until she gets overwhelmed and dies
Guess it's up to me now
Run around the city with my shotgun and pitchfork trying to train the zombies
Only thirty seconds left
I'm overwhelmed but run to the edge knowing I can leave soon
Start shotgunning the incoming horde
Run out of bullets
Stuck trying to pitchfork the surrounding horde
Only five seconds left before I can leave
I die








10/10 would get my hopes up and then have them shattered at the last minute again"

												Let's be honest, zombie games are overdone. The genre is congested with stale, uninspired, boring and pointlessly challenging games that make this over saturated part of the market even more and more irrelevant.  But this game, with its goofy atmosphere, upbeat music  and charming art style, is breathing new life into this undead genre.
Death Road to Canada is an easy game to pick up, an easy one to learn, but even harder to put down. The rogue-like adventure/survival aspects make every play through of this game different and interesting. And with the custom character feature, you are given the power to generate so many more possibilities as you experiment to see who works well with whom.
Part of the reason this game is so easy to fall in love with is the culmination of its dorky sense of humor and catchy OST. For some unforeseeable reason, the chiptune music pairs perfectly with a game about blood, guts and survival. And the possibly fatal decisions you are making on the road turn from frustrating to hilarious due to the comical writing. Never before has a fart been the catalyst that led to my character's downfall, and for that reason alone this game deserves an award. 
I have but two complaints. First is that the RNG can sometimes ruin you. Often you are left with decisions while driving; do you surrender food or fight the bandits? Abandon the car or attempt to fix it? etc, etc. But at times you come to a decision where the solution involves shooting or other skills, and by some cruel twist of fate the character making this decision is the least proficient marksman. And you can't change that. This has never ruined the experience for me, mind you. With these decisions, the game is often fair. All of my failures are my own, not the game's. Save one instance, this is also my second complaint. For some reason, when the AI characters encounter a weapon they already have they get stuck in a perpetual loop of weapon switching. This doesn't happen too often, but when traveling the mall I had two characters of mine get stuck in this loop with umbrellas which resulted in their deaths. This led to a slippery slope which ended in a game over. So beware of that.
Ultimately this game is more than worth your time and money. It's fair yet challenging. It's more fun than frustrating. And it's highly addictive. Give it a chance, especially if you love other rogue games like Binding of Isaac and things of that ilk. I'd also like to recommend checking out more of Rocketcat's games. I enjoy playing their mobile games, and I look forward to see what these devs will do in the future.
TL;DR
Good game. Happy chiptune music. Dog's use crowbars. Farts can be fatal. This game is rife with references to different shows/games/etc. Cat video magazines are a thing in this game and I'm sad that they aren't real."

												Was going to Canada with my roommate and some random girl.

Then we saw a hitchhiker in a hockey mask. Decided to give him a lift to Canada too.

Overnight the random girl disappeared. It was funny. Guy in the hockey mask shows us his machette and chainsaw and it's realy funny. She must have just run off.

Then my roommate disappered the next night without leaving a note... it grieved and it wasn't funny. Hockey mask doesn't say anything.

Shortly after, existance as i know it ceases to be, and the guy in the hockey mask continues our journey for us.

												This game is very enjoyable for those who like to play hack and slash and like to make choices that can be very severe to your team's survival. Some of the deaths during these ""car events"" can be very silly but yet really stupid. The AI in this game is very well tbh imo. Descision making is sometimes hard and having to select the right choice (because yolo) for a situation is very satisfying. I can tell you that Rocketcat Games developers are very active and supportive and will always try to update the game! I bought two of their games on my iphone and they really good! This game is also coming to ios so if you want to having a bigger discount on this game, wait around one month to buy this game on your phone. I think its around 7 dollars. or u can just wait for the steam sale for this game if u want ^.^

i highly recommend this game if you are in to the Telltales, ""walking dead"" kind of games and if you like the ""castle crashers"" hack and slash kind of gameplay!

also every character you play with or make in the game has different traits and personalities and every new game has a random generated events and maps, so that makes the replay value increase!"

												Skill has little or nothing to do with completing this game.  Don't get me wrong, you use skill to play the game.  It's quite fun.  But you can get right up to the end, and on the hour of your triumph the game will simply say ""GAME OVER"" in the most abrupt and unpleasant of manners without even a random chance of your success.  You can be at the top of the stats game, tons of supplies, 1 day from the end, and a dialog appears with a single button ""OK"" and says ""Someone forgot to turn the car engine off when the team went to sleep and the entire team has died from carbon monoxide poisoning.""  Is that even legal?  I've left this game feeling like I've been abused.  Like my rights have been violated on some fundamental level.

Still, I would buy it again.  Is this what Stockholm syndrome feel like?"

												I don't normally review games, sorry if this is a little rough around the edges, for a short written review. 


TL;DR: ""You like Rouge-like games? You like funny things? Buy this, yo.""

I've already spent several hours in the game, and am still far from getting bored with the game, there's so much to love.

The Story:

Very Straightforward, your goal is to get from Canada, from the US (I want to say you start in Florida). However, like many things in life, the story's more about the journey, than the destination. You'll be creating your own story along the way, from choosing how to handle a roadside robbery, to kick certain members out of the group when they complain about the ride too much, to wether or not to give that seemingly pretty friendly dog a knife. 

Gameplay:

The gameplay is fairly straightforward in Death Road. The game is perma-death, meaning once you lose a character, until you start another run they're gone for good.

There are a set of skills in the game that are rolled mostly randomly for all characters, from being able to repair your car to how you handle certain weapons. These stats come into play in a variety of different way throughout the game. 

 Your character(s) have two three major types of weapons they can use. 
1) Melee weapons. Almost all melee weapons will make you tired after repeated use, which takes a few moments before you can really start swinging at the undead spooks again. Most Melee weapons will also break after a certain period of time.
2) Guns. Totally rad. Guns are awesome in every way. Except they take from a preeeeeeeeetty limited supply of bullets. Some runs you're going to have next to no bullets, sometimes you'll have...no bullets. Later on you'll be gathering enough to reliably use them, but conserve ammo wisely.
3) Throwables, from grenades to Molotovs, these help clear a massive wave of zombies. They can also hurt your friends. Found that out the hard way. 

You're charged with fighting horde after horde of the Zombie menace, scavenging for much needed food, fuel, weapons, and ammo. Each character can only take 3 bites from a zombie before they turn into some new lunch meat, so zombies can fairly consistantly pose a large threat in big enough numbers. Getting swarmed and surrounded from all sides will mean almost certain death,

Music:

Aaaahhhhhhh the music is great in this game. It's an awesome contrast from the pretty bleak situation your characters find themselves in, and its actually really enjoyable to listen to while managing your inventory, and making important choices like who should get the first bite of that candy bar. 

Extra Things Worth Mentioning:

Two major things stand out to me that I think are worth bringing up, the Humor and the Character Creator.

The Humor in Death Road is phenominal. Several moments in the game had me actually laughing out loud, atracting the unwanted attention of curious family members. One of my favorite examples of this is:

One of the events your party can experence is stopping by a campsite, and telling ghost stories to one another. However, in one of my runs, only a single character remained, but I saw the ""Tell ghost stories"" option was still there. Assuming it would act like I had more than one party memeber, I clicked it, and was pleasantly supprised by the special dialouge, where half-way through my character discovered he was telling his story to ghosts the entire time. 

The Charactor Creator is also a huge pro in my book. You can create and save up to (roughly) 16 charactes. You can customize several things about these characters, from their looks, to their outlook on life. You can choose to take One or Two of these characters with you at the begining of the game, or instead chose to randomize your starting cast. You will rarely run into your characters you created when you encounter random people throughout the course of the game, making it a very special treat to run into that weird 12th grade teacher you chose to spend 15 minutes creating in a video game. 


All in all I really, really loved the game, and highly suggest it to anyone interested in rougelikes, zombies, or even just fun in general. The game oozes quality, from the random times you'll find yourself bartering with dogs with guns to when you choose to end an argument by driving a car into a tree."

												After having watched Vinny Vinesauce play this, I decided to give it a try. RNGesus can either be your best friend or an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ in this game. You can customize the characters you want to play, as well as give them certain stats/perks. But trust me, no matter how good you make out your character to be, RNG can take him/her down easily. It's no wonder that many people struggle to get a certain character to Canada, since it's 15 in-game days long and a lot of RNG-based events can take place during that time.

I, for one, was on the last day with my own customized character, but was also in a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation. With low health, not much ammo, weak melee weapons and not-so-good stats, I just couldn't make it. SO close, but yet so far.

This is also a good game to stream in the future when I actually can stream. But either way, this game's awesome and I highly recommend it."

												Man, this is a fun game! 

It's got the right mood and the right style. It all fits together so well and it knows that it doesn't want to be taken too seriously. Its a great game if you want to play alone or with a friend. I also really like the character customization as well as the variety of other characters, traits, talents, and other things to spice up the game a bit.

There is one bit of criticism that I want to give. I kinda feel that the music can be a bit repetetive. I feel that adding a couple more tracks could really compliment with the replayability of the game and the desire of the people wanting those cheevos.

Despite that, I recommend this game. It's a great title if you want a quirky post-apocalyptic adventure."

												I kickstarted this game an age ago on a whim, when I got fed up with waiting for Project Zomboid which it has become synonymous for.
Today, I finally decide to give it a go only a few hours before launch.
My surprised was welcome, as this is really fun. 
Like a beat-em-up crossed with Oregon Trail (or Organ Trail) the amount of replayability that is in this game is astounding.

These types of proceedural generated games can live or die on their variety and this game has it in spades. I have played through only 10 games so far, all dying and have loved nearly every moment of it.
There are downsides such as the graphics which on a small budget is understandable.
Also the music is grating at times, with the main theme chiptune track being the worst offender.
And be prepared to have this game crash often.

Pros
+The combat is simple but fun
+The stats for characters add a nice mechanic
+Has heaps of replayability
+Unique characters and scenes are great
+Good dev that is active on the forum and listens

Cons
-Crashes
-Very simple pixel graphics
-Music is hit and miss"

												Ah yes, yet another zombie game. The brainless corpses are being featured in more and more games, to the point where there isn't much freshness left. So... does this Death Road to Canada manage to bring a new spin on the walking dead? Surprisingly, yes. 

The playstyle is nothing new and will be imediately fammiliar to every Oregon Trail (and Organ Trail) fan. You control a group of survivers on their way to Canada, where everything is better... well at least people aren't being eaten alive (and even if they are - free healthcare!) The story is not that complicated and very barebone. All you have to know is that the world is populated by zombies and that Canada is 15 driving days away. 

You start out with two survivers, which you can freely customize. There is quite a lot of different options and everybody can make something to suit their needs. If you're feeling up to it, you can also try rare character mode, where most of the companions you encounter are replaced with people with all sort of special abilities. I'm 8 hours into the game and I'm still often running into new companions, so there is quite a decent variety there. Once you've selected the options you like, you can hit start and be off on your journey.

Every character has different attributes, which aren't visible imediately. Instead, you discover them over time by performing different tasks that require that perticular skill. Another thing you have to keep track of are supplies. You have to gather food, fuel, meds and three types of ammo. If you run out of any of the first two, you're basicly screwed since morale also plays a big part in the game.

There are two parts to the game. The first one is presented by different encounters, where you get to pick what you want to do in a specific situation. Attributes play a huge rule here, as they can be the difference between loosing half of your supplies and beating the bandits in a flexing competition. There are quite a lot of different random events and while you can evade sometimes prevent the negative outcome, this isn't always the case. This means you can sometimes loose a big hunk of supplies (expecialy if you run out of fuel) and even members of the group, which can get quite annoying. Sure, a bit of randomness is welcome, however to much of it can make you feel salty when everything goes to hell.

The second part of the game consists of exploring of areas, populated by zombies. These include different types of missions, such as sieges and scavenging missions, to name a few. They get harder and harder over time and the same holds for the number of zombies, which can sometimes reach over 100 corpses at a time. This means that sometimes it's better to avoid them instead of trying to kill them, since they just keep on coming. Fortunately, there is quite a lot of different weapons and this does help to keep things interesting. 

From the graphics standpoint, the game looks decent but nothing special. The pixelated graphics do help it run smoothly even on older systems and integrated graphic cards, which is a big plus if your computer is a bit outdated. 
Another thing I'd point out is the soundtrack. Some of the reviewers stated that they got annoyed by it after a couple of hours, but I'm still loving it - It just fits so well. 

Conclusion:
Initialy, I've had a bit of a hard time deciding wheather I should recommend Death Road to Canada or not. Mostly because it isn't that cheap (you could argue 15$ is cheap) and there is a lot of randomness that can often screw you over. In the end however, I've decided to put my recommendation on it. I've had quite a lot of fun playing and every run I made seemed unique. While I still haven't managed to finish the game on normal mode, I've still had my share of fun. You know what they say - Sometimes the journey is more important than the destination. 

Final Rating: 7.8/10"

												Although there have been other games that throw Oregon Trail’s ideas into a zombie apocalypse, like some of the best roguelikes (Dungeons of Dredmor being another), Death Road balances its difficulty with a ton of humor and a lighthearted soundtrack. Whenever you lose a party member to zombie death or an unlucky bee sting, there’s some gag or funny line there to break the tension. 

In one playthrough, I:

Rode across the apocalypse in an ice cream truck
Lifted barbells in a zombie-filled gym, boosting my strength
Tore through the undead with a mop
Declined to purchase anime
Was attacked by ants in my sleep
Befriended an Elvis doppelgänger
Was ambushed by a ranting old man who, despite not looking dangerous, killed me

I also love that you can create and save custom characters—I re-created the duo from Zombies Ate My Neighbors."

												One part Zombieland, one part roguelike, and one part 2d action brawler, DRtC is the game that we all hope every zombie game will be. It is the game every zombie game promises to be. It's very specifically the game Organ Trail promised it would be.

I wish I was articulate enough to explain why this game is so good, why it's such a delight to play, and why it's so addictive. I can't, but I hope however high my hours played gets for this will serve as a testament.

												This game takes me back to 2nd grade playing the Oregon Trail ... if zombies had been as popular then as they are now!  Silly, yet surprising difficult, the journey from Florida to Canada is frought with a variety of random events. From cars breaking down, surprised bandit attacks, zombie sieges - the game never lets you get too comfortable.  I will say that the difficulty definitely follows an ever increasing pattern. I have consistently struggled/lost the last of my party around the same time when I hit a particular string of bad luck and/or a really bad siege.

I can't be upset though - what other game lets you have a horse as a party member (poor thing was incredibly useless and it was very unfair to it that it was my last remaining party member and all it could do was NEIGH as it died) or blow up a truck of Twinkies (who knew they were explosive - though I always suspected it).

If you want a quick play with lots of humor and zombies, I'd highly recommend it!"

												8.5/10 game, 5/10 gameplay
This game isn't even RNG, the game director does everything it can to make it impossible for you to win. Extreme difficulty can be fun, but only if the difficulty can be overcome by enough skill.

I had the dream team of 2, a dog and a human, the dog was max intellect (to the point of being able to use a gun), and we had a fast car with 200 gas, 15 food, great weapons etc and the human decided to leave the death road while at NEUTRAL positivity, leaving the dog. Immiedietly after that, i was stuck in a 2 hour hoard in a mall, with so many zombies that the doors were blocked off with no possible escape while the room was quickly filling up, nothing to throw or anything. There was no decicion i could of made earlier in my gameplay that could of prevented that death.

With that out of the way, the gameplay you DO get before being excecuted is fun, plus the soundtrack is dank 

I'm only recommending this game to protect myself from a hundred fanboys that will swarm any negative comment about any game they play, and for anyone who likes getting hecked with a cactus over and over beause they enjoy the game up to that point"

												I loved Darkest Dungeon, the idea of sending a party of your friends into random situations is a great one. Death Road to Canada uses a similar system, however instead of walking through dungeons you are adventuring on to Canada. On your way to Canada you will experience a vast number of different events. These events can range from meeting travellers that end up joining your party to encountering bandit, bodybuilding enthusiasts. These events are the foundation for the game and offer plenty of re-playability to the game itself. 

Exploration
Moving on from the in-game events, lets address one of the negatives I have with the game, exploration. Each building you venture into is extremely lacking in the creativity department. Most buildings will be filled with gas, food and weapons. The problem is to find all of them, you will want to search every room, this creates very boring scenarios of you and your friend searching through empty rooms which are literally empty. They could have atleast added some furniture to make them feel more authentic, but instead if you enter a room with nothing but a bunch of garbage blocking off a door. You instantly know to turn around because it will be one of the MANY empty and pointless rooms in this game. Just to clarify my criticism here Is that the rooms are completely baron of ANYTHING, they didn’t have to contain usable items, but I would have liked to see these rooms contain some sort of personality or baring. Not only did this make exploration, long and arduous but it really encouraged players to skip exploring entirely If they already had enough supplies to last them a while. 

Visuals/Graphics
And now is the part of every review where I talk graphics. Now this game has that same pixelated art style we have all become VERY familiar with over the years. It seems that after one game tried using this retro look EVERY possible indie promotion started using it for reasons I can’t recognise. Luckily here it fits decently, as the world created around your survivors is wacky enough to fit the strange 80’s style visuals. 

Performance
No surprise here with its low CPU and GPU intensive graphics, the game runs fineand they offer you some nice, complementary options; fliters for the screen if you want to go full 80's mode, stylistic screen tearing toggle options and fully rebindable keys. I should also mention that all actions in the game can be changed on controller as well as the keyboard, when you are playing co-op with a friend I found that this was a nifty addition to controller users.

Music
As for the music, it’s quite strange. Normally in a zombie game where you’re fighting for survival you wouldn’t have fun up-beat music sounding off in the background. But much like the visuals it works well with the cheesy game the developers are creating. It took me a while to get used to it but after I did, I can’t imagine going back to the solemn soundtracks of past zombie games. 

Combat
Combat feels decent enough, it doesn’t take away anything from the game but it felt too basic to warrant praise of any kind. In combat you can use guns, melee weapons and explosives. Melee weapons use up your character’s stamina, your character’s stamina is measured in the traits your character has unlocked. Obviously more physically athletic survivors will be able to use their melee weapon for longer without getting tired. The gun play is fine, the game automatically locks on to zombies you are facing which works well enough. I am slightly dissapointed as it felt like the developers were catering a little too much to the controller users rather than the much more plentiful keyboard and mouse users, thsi is ecspecially the case with the gun play, it felt like their main goal was to dumb it down completely so that controller users wouldn't be left behind by the vastly superior PC controls. But in saying that, it's not necessarily a bad system of combat, I just feel like it takes away the benefit of using a keyboard and mouse to a slight degree, and let me highlight the word slight, this is a MINOR nitpick. 

Conclusion
Overall Death Road to Canada is a fun game to play with your friends, you can laugh at the random events that occur and dance to the funky music playing in the background while killing zombies constantly. However, without friends this game is quite bland, exploration is quite a linear experience and on your own the combat feels dreadfully average."

												 Follow the Death Road 
Death Road to Canada is one of those games where you cant stop playing it, almost like going out to a restaruant you really enjoy... but instead of eating food to appeal your appetite you're playing a videogame. I first heard of this game when a YouTuber by the name of PBGGameplay made a halloween themed video about this game, and instantly I knew this was the game for me. The music is amazing and is the exact opposite of what I think a zombie game would have, it reminds me of an old super nintendo TMNT beat-em-up (the best kind of beat-em-up). The gameplay is fun and rewarding, you feel pretty good once you beat a super hard siege or come back from a location with more loot then normal you feel really good and confident. The re-playability is amazing and the different game modes and outcomes for events on the road like the UFO landing sight add so much content  and if you keep the alien alive till the end of the siege you get the UFO as a car . In the end  Death Road to Canada   is my favorite game of 2016, and definitely one of my favorite games of all time. Onward to canada!"

												Started with 2 people 1 a mechanic the other a doctor, killed tons of zombies, along the way I picked up some creepy dog thing in a trench coat, zombies sieged us doggie died already, the rest survived the siege, we sped away in our hatchback.

Things started getting rough, everyone was injured and the doctor kept starting fights. My mechanic saw a sasquatch on the side of the road, we turned around the car to investigate, the mechanic took a picture of the sasquatch tracks and became happy again. We saw a nice hotel on the road, the creepy lady wouldn't let us in. So we kept driving, sieged by zombies again, it was at this point where we decided we had enough, we ditched the car and gave up on our journey to canada.

R.I.P. Creepy trench coat dog thing

In another story

I started off with 2 dog lovers one irritating one calm They were doing well on their fantastic journey they started to run out of gas the one based off my friend decided to siphon gas, he wound up accidentily drinking some gas and getting sick. We visited a camp of traders My friend told one of the traders anime isnt real, the trade got mad at us and made us leave. A recruit showed up on the road, my friend told her to cool it and called her a nerd, she got mad and left. A corgi named kim showed up at the side of the road and joined our crew. Bandits stopped us My friend told them to cool it, he got shanked and died. We had lost our car the corgi and my last survivor, Ivan found a car lot and explored it. Ivan died almost instantly. The corgi sprinted through the car lot, jumped in a police car, started it, and sped away. The game ended just there as the corgi couldnt drive (butsomehowcouldstartacarandspeedaway).

Never forget that corgi I hope they are having fun in canada."

												I may not have that many runs in yet but this game is great. My best run so far was when my buddy had dog friend as a perk and kept attracting dogs to the cause. About five days in I felt I was doing well then it happened. A seige completly devasted me killing the two humans in my party. One getting trapped in the horde and the other overcome by the grief of losing his partner charged head first shooting his shotgun as much as possible. All the while my lassy dog fighting with all its heart trying to save who ever was left. It only lasted seconds though the lassy all that remained. Making a getaway just as the horde closed in the dog was all I had left. Then my lassy decided it was time to stick those keys into the ignition and drive. The next day my lassy was mauled by a moose it was trying to help and thus ended my best run. 10/10"

												Haven't yet gotten to Canada but have had loads of fun every new game. I love making my own characters so it feels like I'm actually surviving the apocolypse with my friends. The controls are a little hard to get used to and there isn't a controls page that I've found but they are simple enough to get on your own. Also they are a little awkard since I am used to WASD and moving my character with the other hand. I don't know how to use the local co op so if someone could help me out on that I would really appreciate it."

												(Disclaimer : Review key recieved from developer)

The Death Road to Canada... or as I like to call it : ""The Happiest Zombie Apocalypse in America""
Bored of those gritty zombie games where you're stuck with relentless brown and green? Tired of those endless drudges through gore and misery only to wind up going from day to day rooting out tins of cold baked beans? Sick and tired of having to scavenge hundreds of planks to make fences for your little survivor camp? Hacked off at seeing the same identikit survivors which stories which all blend into each other and just make you reach for the booze?

Fret no longer, for I present the Happiest Zombie Apocalypse in America

Death Road to Canada is possibly one of the most lighthearted zombie murder games I've run into in a long while, ostensibly taking it's inspiration from the Organ Trail, and FTL, you're put in charge of two survivors, and a car. Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to drive to Canada, or to die trying. Hint, you're going to die a fair few times before you get there, but that's all part of the learning experience. You can either take some random survivors in a default game setting, or you can create your own survivors, be they friends or people you want to see turned into zombie chow, and set off with your own choice of team, with the intent of picking up more friends along the way.

Combat is a little bit loose, but that's intended by design, you are after all, survivors, not trained soldiers, so you tend to waff your melee weapons in the general direction of whatever is closest to you, said weapons ranging from spatulas (no, no joke) right the way through to sledgehammers, hockeysticks, nailboards, and baseball bats. Then you've the proper shootybang stuff with revolvers, pistols, shotguns and so on. The stats of your survivor play a significant part in how many swings they'll get in before they become ""winded"", or in the case of firearms, just how accurate they're prone to be (shotguns you can get away with giving to anyone, other guns you'll want to be a bit more careful with).

DRtC has strong DNA, with a lot of content and a strong level of depth involved
For what could have been a fairly simple pick up and play game, there's a lot of statistical complexity under the hood, with weapons having their own ""drain"" on player stamina, weapons having their own fire rate, accuracy and spread, and vehicles having their own consumption rate, and durability. Characters too have their own personality traits and benefits, meaning that it's unlikely you'll run across two survivors that are exactly the same in a given playthrough, as a direct result, DRtC becomes a far stronger game than the Organ Trail and actually elevates itself up to the company of games like Death Skid Marks, which shares the same kind of irreverant humour and sense of fun about it.

This doesn't even touch on the fact there's pets you can bring into the team (Dogs and Cats, though as yet I've not been successful at grabbing either), there's choose your own adventure style events, though these are more simplistic than say, FTL, they are stat based in terms of the choices you get with differing chances of success, and depending on your survivors, you may get presented with different options from one playthrough to the next.

Closing thoughts
Death Road to Canada -could- have been a throwaway title, or something that would have been fun for a pick up and play but ultimately not something that would stand up to repeated scrutiny. I'm glad to report that this definitely is not the case, there's real longevity here, and there's a definite gem of a game here. One that has managed to emerge as another Kickstarter success (which is a bit of a rarity these days) and one the devs rightly should be quite happy about.

Verdict : Highly recommended, with one caveat which I'll discuss below. 

However, I do not feel that it significantly detracts from the game itself as this is a single player experience, 

it would be nice to see it resolved somewhen though.

There -is- one unanswered question which I'll update my review with as time progresses, and that concerns a KS exclusive piece of content which whilst not *vast*, is game affecting. As is normal for any review I do, I do ""due dilligence"" on all games that go through Kickstarter, and I highlight such things because in the interests of being thorough, that's my job. 

One of the reward tiers ($50) provided backers with a specific game unlock, allowing them to have the option of a kitten or puppy as a ""morale booster"" who would grow into a full team member over time, at the cost of an additional food drain. This would be something in the -longer term- I'd like to see added as purchasable DLC of some sort, as it would be nice to have the full game made ""content complete"", however, as I state above, because this game is predominantly a singleplayer experience, this isn't something that will affect players beyond their personal preference.

This element will be removed or revised as more information is made available."

												Death Road to Canada is an absolutely adorable rouge-like game, despite the amount of spewing guts, bones and limbs flying everywhere around.
Imagine for a second Faster Than Light fused with Project Zomboid, plus ridiculous amount of cute humor. Nothing vulgar or dark. Biggest insult you'll encounter in this game is Dingus (and even that is not an insult :p).
There's almost not a single conversation in-game that didn't give me a little smile. 
Combat, and the whole game itself, is simple, minimalistic, non complex at all and still manages to be so addictive and amazing.
Today many games advertise on ""randomly generated"" marketing, but not as many manage to execute the mechanic well. Death Road to Canada is not bragging about it, yet it has one of the most impressive randomization mechanics I've ever seen in games.
When I said it has resemblance to FTL, it's not just about its replayability, but also the perfectly short campaign.
Games with replay value should be exactly like that. Short and interesting, and not have 1000s of hours per playthrough. My shortest (successful) playthorugh on normal difficulty was approximately 1.5 hours. I am yet to do the longer campaign mode, but am already eager to try it out after countless amounts of fails.
And speaking of fails, unlike many other rouge-like games, this one does not make you want to smash your keyboard againt the display when you lose. i can't quite explain why. Maybe it's the games general poistivity vibe, maybe it's because things lost are not so hard to gain. Maybe both.
And finally for someone like myself who is absolutely into retro games, this one will grab nostalgia by its weakest point. Amazing pixel art combined with great 8-bit soundtrack is a perfect formula to satisfy all the gamers dating way back from times of NES/Sega consoles.

Overall amazing. I have absolutely not a single complaint.
It's humorous, simple, minimalistic, beautiful and has got great replay value to it.

Passing a game like this is like a sin for every self respective gamer, to say the least"

												Take Oregon Trail/Organ Trail's journey and mostly random event and decision making mechanics, add stats to affect combat and events, put yourself in full control of the characters, and add fun mayhem and overwhelming hordes of zombies. 
Death Road to Canada is a game that has a wondeful sense of humor that are both randomly hilarious and have references to pop culture you can infer from events. Having the ability to customize your survivors between naming them, stats, and appearance is a great addition to affecting your decision to figuring out who's expendable, and who you'll dive into the horde of zombies to save. The game has a great looting mechanic that really makes you break all the things to find precious resources to keep heading on to Canada, which you hear is a magical and zombie free safe place."

												Lots of games have made me lose faith that developers even care about what they put into their games anymore. 
Death Road to Canada restores that faith in me.

If I were to sum up this entire game in two scenes that happened in this game, it would be these two.

A dog named Hershel told some guy with a shotgun to ""Cool It!,"" and then proceeeded to fart in this guy's face. This causes the guy to have an emotional breakdown, question what he's been doing with his life, and through some line of thinking, gives the dog his prized autoshotgun.

The same dog, Hershel, told a band of bandits to ""Cool It!,"" and the bandits completely forgot they were robbing the rest of my team, and just brutally murdered Hershel.

10/10
Made me feel more emotions than most games these days."

												Let's be honest, zombie games are overdone. The genre is congested with stale, uninspired, boring and pointlessly challenging games that make this over saturated part of the market even more and more irrelevant.  But this game, with its goofy atmosphere, upbeat music  and charming art style, is breathing new life into this undead genre.
Death Road to Canada is an easy game to pick up, an easy one to learn, but even harder to put down. The rogue-like adventure/survival aspects make every play through of this game different and interesting. And with the custom character feature, you are given the power to generate so many more possibilities as you experiment to see who works well with whom.
Part of the reason this game is so easy to fall in love with is the culmination of its dorky sense of humor and catchy OST. For some unforeseeable reason, the chiptune music pairs perfectly with a game about blood, guts and survival. And the possibly fatal decisions you are making on the road turn from frustrating to hilarious due to the comical writing. Never before has a fart been the catalyst that led to my character's downfall, and for that reason alone this game deserves an award. 
I have but two complaints. First is that the RNG can sometimes ruin you. Often you are left with decisions while driving; do you surrender food or fight the bandits? Abandon the car or attempt to fix it? etc, etc. But at times you come to a decision where the solution involves shooting or other skills, and by some cruel twist of fate the character making this decision is the least proficient marksman. And you can't change that. This has never ruined the experience for me, mind you. With these decisions, the game is often fair. All of my failures are my own, not the game's. Save one instance, this is also my second complaint. For some reason, when the AI characters encounter a weapon they already have they get stuck in a perpetual loop of weapon switching. This doesn't happen too often, but when traveling the mall I had two characters of mine get stuck in this loop with umbrellas which resulted in their deaths. This led to a slippery slope which ended in a game over. So beware of that.
Ultimately this game is more than worth your time and money. It's fair yet challenging. It's more fun than frustrating. And it's highly addictive. Give it a chance, especially if you love other rogue games like Binding of Isaac and things of that ilk. I'd also like to recommend checking out more of Rocketcat's games. I enjoy playing their mobile games, and I look forward to see what these devs will do in the future.
TL;DR
Good game. Happy chiptune music. Dog's use crowbars. Farts can be fatal. This game is rife with references to different shows/games/etc. Cat video magazines are a thing in this game and I'm sad that they aren't real."

												Let me tell you a story about a guy and a random dog he found in a ditch.

Girlymaaaaaaaaaan (Named after an akward time back in college when he looked like the Bootleg Michael Jackson) was driving to canada in his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hybrid car with 2 expendable ♥♥♥♥♥ in the trunk, then 1 day when they we´re driving like usual, a feral ♥♥♥♥ing mut replaces one of the expendable dudes.
After that the dog (now named Smith) does jackshit and lets his new comrades die. Then 1 fatal day when he let´s the last Humie (GIRLYMAAAAAAAAAAAN) die, he steals the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hybrid car and starts driving, shooting, trading, farting in the car and wandering who the hell did it even tough he´s the only being in the car.
Then one day smith desides to have a little humanity and help some dudes in a shootout and ends up being shot and killed.
R.I.P Smith the dog, a true deathroad survivor. PS. 10/10 whould leave Bootleg Michael Jackson die in a cottage again."

												I'm going to be straight. This review would be a 5/10, but Steam insists on black and white reviews. Death Road has a lot going for it, from the charming graphics to the character customisation, but at its core, it's deeply flawed. I love rogue like games that allow you a chance to progress through a random universe, and FTL will always be a game I run back toward, but Death Road lacks this appeal. Strip away the zombies and you'll have a game where the random event/number generator won't just steer or manipulate your adventure, but flat out cripple it with zero input. You'll often find yourself being skewered by Bandits after running out of gas, simply because the game never provided enough for you to loot. For ten bucks it's a bit of fun, but it seems to lack some solid balance behind the chibi-sprites and Final Fantasy menus. I'd prefer it if this game rewarded skill a great deal more."

My #1 complaint is poor AI companion pathfinding, and with such a small team, it may be a while before they can really sort it out. But the updates so far have been very encouraging, so if you can get over some unfair deaths and losses and just look forward to trying new stuff on the next run, I can't recommend this enough."

												So I started up a game with a guy named Oswoldo and another named Wrektangle. It starts off fine, and everything seems to be working out. Until they reach a bandit check point, so I sent oswoldo to convince them to let us go through... But Oswoldo turns out to be a total ♥♥♥♥ and joins the bandits ditching Wrektangle. Wrektangle drives ahead for a little while and it was smooth sailing but then he ran into an NPC named Clown. The logical course of action was for Wrektangle to let him in the car... you know the sensible thing to do. From then on Clown seemed to just be a little bit wierd until about 8 days till Canada. They sit down in an abondoned building in some infested city Wrektangle happed upon some rare loot, a nice suprise after wasting 2 hours trying find keys to an ice cream truck. Clown then whips out a music box and starts playing circus music. Wrektangle goes to yell at him but Clown is gone without a trace. Then as the music is still playing a massive hoard of zomies storm into the building and Wrektangle goes down in a blaze of glory... Thus ends the tragic tale of Wrektangle

10/10 Game would clown again"

												PROS
-This game is hard which means you cant just beat this game in one try. You'll have to put actually effort to win
-Each try depending on how long you live can last from 20min to a couple hours 
-cant stop playing one of those one more try games
-customizable characters making the game more personalized
-multiple game modes
-tons of weapons and traits
-game getting lots of updates
-A.I is good enough to not get themselves killed easily
-lots of charm
-ZOMBIES!!!
-fun combat 
-cant stay in a place too long making you decide whether or not to enter another location for just a little more supply or make that risky decision in events
-amazing soundtrack
-simple and changeable controls
-fun in single player and co-op
CONS
-cant manage your food and who gets healed (characters will instantly heal a random person and it would be cool if you could decide who gets food)
-some events instantly screw you over and you can be pretty far in a run when it happens (bandits mainly)
-if you don't want a character to be on your team because your running out of food or their traits aren't useful anymore you cant get rid of them unless they die or you get somebody to replace the character
NEUTRAL
-randomized events repeat a lot (more updates are coming soon and different characters have different reactions to events so its neutral)
SUMMARY
I love this game and I will not stop playing until I beat every game mode and maybe even make challenges for myself. This game has lots of features and charm with more features to come. My only problems are mainly just things I want added to the game or nitpicks I had with the game. I definitely recommend this game."

												My actual hours in this game are probably closer to sixty. It's a great time killer, but don't expect to go in thinking you have a chance. Your success will largely depend on luck. Most of the deaths were fun though, and I kinda rate on a dollar to ""enjoyed hour"" ratio, so Death Road is a clear winner."

												It started out as an adventure of my friend, Nic, and I to Canada. We've known each other since we were small. Together we survived some pretty prickly situations and we met a few friends along the way, Rusty and Jacinda. 

We were a rag tag group of survivors content on the idea of making it to Canada. Things were looking great but unfortunately that didn't last long. We had lost our car and were forced to trek on foot. 

After what seemed to be an eternity, we spotted a cabin and a van that resembled a dog. After fighting through the horde of zombies, we managed to find the keys. We struggled to make it back to the van, but we were on our way to Canada once again!

We all were in need of rest after the all the excitement we had endured during the day so we had found an empty house along the roadside. Night was falling upon us, as leader, I appointed Jacinda to barricade duty. This was a fatal decision on my part as leader. I may not have been perfect but I always seemed to keep us on top. Night had fallen and we were surrounded by zombies. With Jacinda's lackluster job, they had been able to break in and we had lost Nic and Rusty. Jacinda and I had narrowly escaped with our lives. 

Bitter towards Jacinda, I knew ultimately it was my decision which had led to the death of my childhood friend, Nic, and our beloved teammate, Rusty. Even after these events, we couldn't forget our initial goal of this journey. It was to make it to Canada. The sacrifice of our friend's could not be in vain. Once again, we pushed on.

Low on supplies and down to just the two of us, we decided to enter a nearby town to gear up. The rain helped muffle our sounds enough to push past the large packs of angry and aggressive zombies. We found a house with enough supplies to last us the remainder of our trip. Now we just needed to get back to our van.

On our way out the door, we noticed the large packs had moved to the outside of the house we were in, and sadly, we were spotted. We had tried to stand our ground, but were quickly overwhelmed and were forced to run. Making a mad dash to our van, we had gotten ourselves surrounded. 

It was in that moment that Jacinda had taken her hatchet and started fighting and pushing her way through one side. Myself and a bloody and beaten Jacinda had managed to make it to the doorway of a small house. She was bitten all over and we both knew that it was over for her. She told me to go inside without her. She said she was sorry but this is where her story ends. Reluctantly, I turned and closed the door.

Here I sit in this small house, alone and waiting for my impending doom while I write this letter. Moans and sounds of limbs banging against the door. I feel at peace.

10/10 Simulator for when 'murica falls because of the Trumpster. Would die travelling to Canada again."

												8.5/10 game, 5/10 gameplay
This game isn't even RNG, the game director does everything it can to make it impossible for you to win. Extreme difficulty can be fun, but only if the difficulty can be overcome by enough skill.

I had the dream team of 2, a dog and a human, the dog was max intellect (to the point of being able to use a gun), and we had a fast car with 200 gas, 15 food, great weapons etc and the human decided to leave the death road while at NEUTRAL positivity, leaving the dog. Immiedietly after that, i was stuck in a 2 hour hoard in a mall, with so many zombies that the doors were blocked off with no possible escape while the room was quickly filling up, nothing to throw or anything. There was no decicion i could of made earlier in my gameplay that could of prevented that death.

With that out of the way, the gameplay you DO get before being excecuted is fun, plus the soundtrack is dank 

I'm only recommending this game to protect myself from a hundred fanboys that will swarm any negative comment about any game they play, and for anyone who likes getting hecked with a cactus over and over beause they enjoy the game up to that point"

												-it was an average day. or so i thought.
-zombies invaded our town so i knew i had to escape to a place with no zombies, canada.
-i took a long a buddy named greg with me to canada. greg was a great  mechanic and doctor so i knew he'd be  perfect
-all was going well, we looted several places, stocked up on food, gas, and medical equipment
-along the road i spotted a dog. i recruited the dog, raliegh, to the team as we had more then enough food
-raleigh was extremely trustworthy and we used him to bride bandits and what not
-we continue our trek to canada, fending off hordes of zombies whilst collecting loots
-we then met peter on the side of the street alone
-knowing we had alot of food we thought another person wouldnt hurt us
-hes a fighter, lets recruit him they said
-look how big he is they said
-he'll be perfect they said
-so we allowed peter to join even though i really did not want to
-none the less he was a fighter and a warrior, and he really helped out the team
-or so we thought
-i began to get excited, as we had plenty of supplies and only 4 days left
-i began to trsut peter, and knowing he was a good shot, i gave him a gun
-and that was all good
-but what happened next will haunt me for the rest of my life
-we ran into a town, and in a house the was a grenade
-at the time i had never used a grenade, so  igave it to peter
-and that was the worst mistake of my life
-the next time we encountered a horde, and just as it looked like we deafeted it, we had not
-peter, who i had begun to trust had turned sides, a traitor as some may say
-he threw the grenade right at all of our feet
-he had instantly killed himself and greg, and severly injured me and raleigh
-flashbacks began to cross my mind of my vietnam days
-me and raleigh believed petercould have been apart of isis
-as we sit there half dead the zombies began to enclosure us
-me and raleigh could not escapeand had died

10/10 would trust an isis member again

												Great, somewhat random, but not, an exercise in patience with destiny as things happen over which you have very limited control, but are interesting to see happen.  Happily, it's interspersed with things over which you -do- have control (killing zombies in a continually cute and crunchy way).

Have played at least 10 runs without reaching the fabled Eden of Canada, and will play at least 5 more."

												PROS
-This game is hard which means you cant just beat this game in one try. You'll have to put actually effort to win
-Each try depending on how long you live can last from 20min to a couple hours 
-cant stop playing one of those one more try games
-customizable characters making the game more personalized
-multiple game modes
-tons of weapons and traits
-game getting lots of updates
-A.I is good enough to not get themselves killed easily
-lots of charm
-ZOMBIES!!!
-fun combat 
-cant stay in a place too long making you decide whether or not to enter another location for just a little more supply or make that risky decision in events
-amazing soundtrack
-simple and changeable controls
-fun in single player and co-op
CONS
-cant manage your food and who gets healed (characters will instantly heal a random person and it would be cool if you could decide who gets food)
-some events instantly screw you over and you can be pretty far in a run when it happens (bandits mainly)
-if you don't want a character to be on your team because your running out of food or their traits aren't useful anymore you cant get rid of them unless they die or you get somebody to replace the character
NEUTRAL
-randomized events repeat a lot (more updates are coming soon and different characters have different reactions to events so its neutral)
SUMMARY
I love this game and I will not stop playing until I beat every game mode and maybe even make challenges for myself. This game has lots of features and charm with more features to come. My only problems are mainly just things I want added to the game or nitpicks I had with the game. I definitely recommend this game."

												I should probably mention that I've only played 8.7 hours and I've only ever played Familiar Characters Mode, so I haven't fully explored the game yet, but from what I've played, I can say it's one of my most favorite games of 2016. The gameplay is extremely fun and never seemed to grow boring, the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, and the graphics are brilliant. And even though I haven't played it as much recently, I still have the soundtrack stuck in my head. If you've played games like Oregon Trail or Super Amazing Wagon Adventure and enjoyed them, you will enjoy this. I recommend this game fully, I fail to see how anybody could hate this game after playing it. There are so many different modes which just adds more playability. I feel like there could be more customization, but for what they have right now is great. Overall a great game and definitely in my top 5 games for 2016, highly recommend for anybody."

												This game will make you laugh and cry. 
It's like Oregon trail but with zombies and humor. 
First few tries, you don't mind dying but after that you just want to finish so when you do it feels amazing.
Pretty dificult sometimes even with the, ""Rare Characters"" mode which makes it easier to find unusual but powerful characters.
Make tough choices.
Tell people to, ""COOL IT""
Tell people to, ""SAY IT DON'T SPRAY IT""
Interesting dialogue.
Dogs.
A Gnome riding a rat.
Rob friendly traders because you need supplies.
Leave your team members in a horde of zombies so they can probably unwillingly sacrifice themselves for you
Tell traders that, ""Anime isn't real"" until you stumble upon an anime girl that shoots hearts from a magical wand up until she explodes from becoming increasing kawaii.
Get angry when your team mates swap out their good weapons that you gave them for random ♥♥♥♥ weapons.
Be disheartened when you realize you'll have a hard and frustrating time completing the game because there's only two guides on steam relating to the game.
G E T  P U M P E D  U P.
Grunt with internal rage when one of your chracters throws a molotov or some kind of bomb and it kill one of your team.
(I'd recommend just staying away from molotovs altogether)
Surprising amount of character creation customization.
Create your family and friends only to have them die in glorious zombie combat because they have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fitness and strength stats.
Laugh with glee as you get amazing lucky events such as finding toilet paper.
Glance nervously at the clock during a siege because you've been backed into a corner and you're desperate for a way out of the mess you got yourself into.
Feel obligated to play this game until you make it to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Canada.
Have a party member named Canada so certain dialogue is funny.
Get killed by stupid things like climbing a tree and team mates turning out to be STUPID ♥♥♥♥ING TRASH.
Get attacked by bees.
Get attacked by feral dogs.
Get attacked by bears.
Get attacked by meese.
Get attacked by feral cats.

I found this game really enjoyable for the time that I played it, which wasn't really 45 hours, I just happened to leave my PC on overnight a few times with the game open. I told myself that I would play the game more after I initially finished it the first time but when I started a new playthrough right after I actually finished it, I kept thinking I wanted to take a break and play a different game. Still, for $15 dollars this game is to me, a must have because it's 100% worth the experience.

10/10 would tell people to  C O O L  I T  again."

												I have to say, it's like people said!
It's Organ Trail and all it's others systems. I'm getting pretty addicted to this game and wanting to get to Canada (as my character of course).

You start off as a survivor and maybe a buddy wanting to go to Canada as heard from the game is the safest place in the World and go through many places to gather supplies and loot to survive your road trip there. With the RNG system you can either get good or bad rolls. It can also depend on your character's traits and perks to which the system gives you. Usually the trait gives good and bad side effects and the perk gives you a good one. The game starts to get difficult as you progress through the game and gets pretty intense too. 

The only troubles I've been having are sieges being really difficult especially with the RNG paths it gives me, but it doesn't stop me from giving hope that I can make it to Canada! 

So far I've made it to Canada once in Rare Characters mode. L*nk (Don't sue N*ntendo) is pretty much the the best Rare Characters from at least my view since his sword upgrades  are pretty much OP.

I highly recommend this game for people who love Organ Trail and difficult games.
10/10 for me! :D"

												Great game, distinct from The Organ Trail despite the same overall concept. This is more of a frenzied sprint rather than The Organ Trail's marathon - instead of distance, you have 15 days of driving from Florida to Canada. You need gas, food, and whatever you can get your hands on. Good luck, godspeed, try not to die.

Exploring points of interest makes up a majority of the gameplay and is very action oriented. You can choose who goes out, and then the scavenging party goes of to a randomly generated SNES style action map level, very distinct from OT's EGA emulation. 

Shooting zombies was the main defense in OT. While that's an option here, there's a huge emphasis on melee, knocking down enemies, and mobility - running past zombies RE style is usually your best option when scavenging. You and your buddies can die out there, you do not immediately get sent back to safety OT style after zombie contact. It actually takes being cornered or prolonged zombie contact to die, though, hence the mobility emphasis.

The only real complaint I have is that some mechanics may be initially obtuse, though you will probably be okay with this if you are a fan of rogue-likes that do similar things. For example, stats are hidden until you use them, which can be quite frustrating if you make assumptions or are gambling wildly on skills. I can't really say it's a negative as it does become more apparent over time who is good at what, or if you just make custom characters, but beware if it's your first time out!

In summary: good gameplay that's more active and engaging. Lots of game modes, easy to get in and out of, quite funny, great music, and gives me an odd River City Ransom vibe when scavenging, especially with some ai partners or better yet a second local player along.

Final note:
For the love of god, if you find a man dressed as Garfield, DO NOT TAKE HIM ALONG. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID. HE IS THE ANGEL OF DEATH AND MONDAYS."

												Saw some gaming YouTube channels I regularly watch play it, thought it was cool (especially since I'm fond of roguelikes), and added it to my wishlist on Steam and kind of forgot about it. 

Cue Autumn sale. Decided to buy it. Let it sit in my library for about a week or so before deciding to play.

All I can say is this: WOW.

Right from the start, it's pretty damn good. Nothing says ""awesome"" like slashing through zombies while going north (Though a zombie apocalypse seems more like an average day in Florida anyways). Sure, I haven't had too many runs so far, but they were surprisingly kind of intense. Every death sucks, especially in the times where I've gotten so far, but that's roguelikes for you, and that's why I love them.

Also, I'm Alexandra the resilient martial artist with a kitchen knife. Can't beat that."

												I've come to like Death Road to Canada, its a neat little indie title that has had some thought put into it.  Its a nice twist on an old concept, I'd honestly say that it plays similar to faster than light, only instead of aliens you have to fight zombies. Death Road requires inventory and resource management, some on the fly environmental awareness and deciding whether or not you have the resources to recruit additional members to your group of happy, hopeful survivors. Speaking of recruitable members, you can come across a wide variety of survivors, ranging from your run of the mill pistol and crowbar toting survivor, to a Jason Vorhees lookalike and a magical anime girl, you can even recruit the occasional dog into your group. The game also has quite a few random encounters which can put your group members skills to the test. you may have to pass charisma or strenght checks or perhaps a more in depth shooting or medical skill check. The game has a quirky sense of humor that isn't for everyone, personally I find some of the jokes a little hit and miss. The game is a little pricey for what it is, with other indie titles of a similar style going for much less, would recommend waiting until Christmas or Summer when this will probably go on sale.

Positives 
>Wide variety of weapons to choose from
>Suprisingly good character customisation 
>Wide range of skills for your character 
>A decent assortment of vehicles to find and use in your trek to Canada 
>The randomly generated style of play can provide a decent challenge 
>The humor is pretty good in places 
>Soundtrack included in the game's files 
>A pixel art style that has had some effort put into it 

Negatives 

>For those who have grown tired of pixel art, this may not be for you
>RNG can make the game punishingly difficult 
>Sometimes the game provides you with little supplies on the early stages, amplifying the difficulty later on
>Zombie encounters are sometimes too few and far between, sometimes they occur too often
>Priced a little high for what is essentially a rather basic game (Honestly, Hotline Miami cost less than this)

Finally, I'll go on record by saying that this is perhaps the only game i've played so far where a character can be killed by stubbing their toe on a rock."

												I can't tell you how much I love this game. This game easily became my favorite game of 2016 just because of how great it really is. Death Road To Canada is a special kind of game that uses things we have seen in other games, such as organ trail, but heavily improves on. From making friends and family as survivors, to laugh out loud funny moments, DRTC is well worth the asking price of $15. If you don't have this game, you should get it ASAP. There's something about killing zombies, telling everyone to ""COOL IT"" and fighting bigfoot that really keeps you into it. I love this game and I want to thank the dev for just blessing us with such a treat. DRTC is a must have for just about everyone, and I cannot wait to see how much more will be added on to this already amazing game. 10/10"

												This game is so entertaining, I've always wanted a game like The Oregon Trail, but with a different premise; And DR2C is just that game.
The charm that the game holds, and humorous events only adds to the fun when playing and managing a rag-tag team of survivors (It's better if you make characters of your friends and family, it really adds to the experience).
The only complaints I have are just small ones, like the game being really f**king hard, (But that's probably a problem with me, more than the game) and might benefit from an easier mode right from the get-go.

 All in all,  I give it a 9.2 out of 10"

												First playthrough:  Was doing fine until we came across a goat, and I made the mistake of inviting him into the party. He immediately kicked and killed my lead character, was a jerk to everybody else in the car, and refused to leave the party when I came across another far more useful survivor. He refused to wield any useful weapons (preferring to drop them at the most inopportune times when we were being swarmed by zombies.) As he was the only character with any health left, I posted him on guard while the rest of the party slept, and he immediately fell asleep allowing all of our food and medical supplies to get stolen. Dangerously low on morale and health, he caused a huge argument that caused us to run off the road straight into a massive swarm of zombies, who massacred everyone but the goat. The goat then decided he didn't care two ☠☠☠☠s about Canada, and proceeded to walk off into the sunset. This is actually the closest I've come to winning the game so far.

10/10 - Would have my entire party killed by an evil backstabbing goat again."

												I just came out of my best run at this game yet. Me and my motley crew had a hybrid which took us up to 7 days out from Canada. Sadly we broke down and while walking in the woods we stumbled across an alien. And his alien car! With the promise of getting this car after the seige we fought. My team scraped through and once we had been told how to open the car we fought through uncountable waves of undead to reach this strange, grey vehicle. We leapt in and slammed the doors, revving the engine, preparing to shoot off into the sunset. Then the car exploded and we both died. 
This game is amazing. The style is really fun, the music is quirky and charming and the humor is on point. Definately worth the £10!"

												Frustration intensifies. If only I am allowed to express my anger towards this game, i would curse the heck out of it.

Your journey to Canada will be riddled with both luck and bad events. One poor decision will make a domino effect of terrible outcomes with a slight chance of slipping it through. You can have your significant other to become your buddy in the apocalpyse but as of now, there is a flaw in terms of control upon death but rest assured that it will be addressed in the future updates."

												In Death Road to Canada, you are a survivor making their way from Florida to Canada in a brutal zombie-infested roadtrip. Along the way you'll meet friends, enemies, and frenemies with their own randomized skills and characteristics. You can also create your own survivors and set their appearence and traits. The undead, bandits, and your own ineptitude will put your survival skills to the test as you collect food, fuel, medicine, and bullets. All of which are important on the Death Road.

The highlight of Death Road to Canada is the absurdity of it. Mexican wrestlers, giant bug-eyed anime girls, or a Monday-hating orange cat can be meet on the road as RARE characters. Reading SWOLE magazine increasing your strength or transforming your dog into a Dogman, the randomized events on the Death Road make each attempt more interesting than the last. All while making you laugh, this game will punch you in the gut with its difficulty and other game modes to mix things up.

I wholeheartedly recommend this game for its replayability, awesome soundtrack, and the comedic tone that makes it a memorable roadtrip simulator.

												More than just a bunch of combat & survival gameplay, DR2C is a story creator. On my very first playthrough, I really felt invested in the characters I managed to save and recruit -- they had personalities, skills and weaknesses, and felt like real, fleshed-out characters. Their adventure was marked by funny moments, big losses and lucky finds. Their ending was brutal and tragic. I expect to have thoroughly different experiences on each playthrough and look forward to that."

												So I started up a game with a guy named Oswoldo and another named Wrektangle. It starts off fine, and everything seems to be working out. Until they reach a bandit check point, so I sent oswoldo to convince them to let us go through... But Oswoldo turns out to be a total ♥♥♥♥ and joins the bandits ditching Wrektangle. Wrektangle drives ahead for a little while and it was smooth sailing but then he ran into an NPC named Clown. The logical course of action was for Wrektangle to let him in the car... you know the sensible thing to do. From then on Clown seemed to just be a little bit wierd until about 8 days till Canada. They sit down in an abondoned building in some infested city Wrektangle happed upon some rare loot, a nice suprise after wasting 2 hours trying find keys to an ice cream truck. Clown then whips out a music box and starts playing circus music. Wrektangle goes to yell at him but Clown is gone without a trace. Then as the music is still playing a massive hoard of zomies storm into the building and Wrektangle goes down in a blaze of glory... Thus ends the tragic tale of Wrektangle

10/10 Game would clown again"

												Saw some gaming YouTube channels I regularly watch play it, thought it was cool (especially since I'm fond of roguelikes), and added it to my wishlist on Steam and kind of forgot about it. 

Cue Autumn sale. Decided to buy it. Let it sit in my library for about a week or so before deciding to play.

All I can say is this: WOW.

Right from the start, it's pretty damn good. Nothing says ""awesome"" like slashing through zombies while going north (Though a zombie apocalypse seems more like an average day in Florida anyways). Sure, I haven't had too many runs so far, but they were surprisingly kind of intense. Every death sucks, especially in the times where I've gotten so far, but that's roguelikes for you, and that's why I love them.

Also, I'm Alexandra the resilient martial artist with a kitchen knife. Can't beat that."

Along the road we  had to deal with loads of bandits, got really beefy, and charmed a dog into giving us free bullets. Unfortunately we all died at the Canadian border shortly after kicking the first member of the team out for being a grade-A dink.

												(Disclaimer : Review key recieved from developer)

The Death Road to Canada... or as I like to call it : ""The Happiest Zombie Apocalypse in America""
Bored of those gritty zombie games where you're stuck with relentless brown and green? Tired of those endless drudges through gore and misery only to wind up going from day to day rooting out tins of cold baked beans? Sick and tired of having to scavenge hundreds of planks to make fences for your little survivor camp? Hacked off at seeing the same identikit survivors which stories which all blend into each other and just make you reach for the booze?

Fret no longer, for I present the Happiest Zombie Apocalypse in America

Death Road to Canada is possibly one of the most lighthearted zombie murder games I've run into in a long while, ostensibly taking it's inspiration from the Organ Trail, and FTL, you're put in charge of two survivors, and a car. Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to drive to Canada, or to die trying. Hint, you're going to die a fair few times before you get there, but that's all part of the learning experience. You can either take some random survivors in a default game setting, or you can create your own survivors, be they friends or people you want to see turned into zombie chow, and set off with your own choice of team, with the intent of picking up more friends along the way.

Combat is a little bit loose, but that's intended by design, you are after all, survivors, not trained soldiers, so you tend to waff your melee weapons in the general direction of whatever is closest to you, said weapons ranging from spatulas (no, no joke) right the way through to sledgehammers, hockeysticks, nailboards, and baseball bats. Then you've the proper shootybang stuff with revolvers, pistols, shotguns and so on. The stats of your survivor play a significant part in how many swings they'll get in before they become ""winded"", or in the case of firearms, just how accurate they're prone to be (shotguns you can get away with giving to anyone, other guns you'll want to be a bit more careful with).

DRtC has strong DNA, with a lot of content and a strong level of depth involved
For what could have been a fairly simple pick up and play game, there's a lot of statistical complexity under the hood, with weapons having their own ""drain"" on player stamina, weapons having their own fire rate, accuracy and spread, and vehicles having their own consumption rate, and durability. Characters too have their own personality traits and benefits, meaning that it's unlikely you'll run across two survivors that are exactly the same in a given playthrough, as a direct result, DRtC becomes a far stronger game than the Organ Trail and actually elevates itself up to the company of games like Death Skid Marks, which shares the same kind of irreverant humour and sense of fun about it.

This doesn't even touch on the fact there's pets you can bring into the team (Dogs and Cats, though as yet I've not been successful at grabbing either), there's choose your own adventure style events, though these are more simplistic than say, FTL, they are stat based in terms of the choices you get with differing chances of success, and depending on your survivors, you may get presented with different options from one playthrough to the next.

Closing thoughts
Death Road to Canada -could- have been a throwaway title, or something that would have been fun for a pick up and play but ultimately not something that would stand up to repeated scrutiny. I'm glad to report that this definitely is not the case, there's real longevity here, and there's a definite gem of a game here. One that has managed to emerge as another Kickstarter success (which is a bit of a rarity these days) and one the devs rightly should be quite happy about.

Verdict : Highly recommended, with one caveat which I'll discuss below. 

However, I do not feel that it significantly detracts from the game itself as this is a single player experience, 

it would be nice to see it resolved somewhen though.

There -is- one unanswered question which I'll update my review with as time progresses, and that concerns a KS exclusive piece of content which whilst not *vast*, is game affecting. As is normal for any review I do, I do ""due dilligence"" on all games that go through Kickstarter, and I highlight such things because in the interests of being thorough, that's my job. 

One of the reward tiers ($50) provided backers with a specific game unlock, allowing them to have the option of a kitten or puppy as a ""morale booster"" who would grow into a full team member over time, at the cost of an additional food drain. This would be something in the -longer term- I'd like to see added as purchasable DLC of some sort, as it would be nice to have the full game made ""content complete"", however, as I state above, because this game is predominantly a singleplayer experience, this isn't something that will affect players beyond their personal preference.

This element will be removed or revised as more information is made available."

												tl;dr: A roguelike zombie survival game done right. 

There's many things about this game that just keep making making me tell myself ""one more try"" even after I've been playing it for hours. So far the only bug I've seen is when you get through a tiny space and your teamates will make an entire circle around the object so that they can get to you, that got my teamates killed many, many times.

One of my best runs so far, was with a guy named Dik, I gave him Megabuff and Warrior and tried to make him look like a biker. He had basically become a zombie master, with almost all abilities maxed out. I was 1 day from Canada, had more than 60 food and died to a molotov I threw at a group of zombies during a siege. My dog was the only one left, and even though he survived the siege, I hadn't teached him to drive a car, so I ended up losing and starting over. But I couldn't be mad at the game, because it was my fault.

Now, onto the pros and cons.

PROS:
+Randomly generated maps, survivors and personalities.
+Random events (I once got my character possessed by a demon)
+Zombies get more aggressive the more time you spend on a mission
+YOU CAN THROW FURNITURE AROUND!
+The game has a good sense of humour
+Decent amout of skills and perks to choose from, and you can level up your skills
+Teamates who are actually smart about weapon choice. For example, if your follower is using a melee weapon but gets tired and is carrying a ranged weapon, it will change to the ranged weapon until it has enough stamina back. It will also pick up weapons on the ground when it has none left.

CONS:
-Not many customization options, females get more than males
-The follower's pathfinding sometimes bugs out
-Sometimes if there's a weapon on the floor, your teamate will keep changing his weapons continuously until you move away from it
-Only local co-op.

All in all, i'd give this game a solid 9/10. I really love this game and hope to see it getting some new updates soon"

												This earns a seat next other magnificent indie retro games like ""Party Hard"" and ""Rouge Legacy"". But in a lot of ways this is technically better then both. Having multiple modes to choose from to fit your play style or your time frame and even for your experience. Adding in a reasonable character customization that can tailor your leader/potential traveling company personality and look. You can make any one from a basic solder to a YouTube celebrity like Jim Sterling. The coolest feature is one that we are starting to see less and less of in the AAA gaming industry, couch co-op. My only gripe is that it could use some mod support for players to add to this already incredible game.

I play consoles more often than not. But when I get that retro, nostalgia itch or an experience that I just can’t find on consoles, I go to steam. And my goodness this's a treasure. I give this a 9/10.

A most have on Steam."

												I very rarely will invest money into a full price pixel art indie game, but this one was well worth the financial risk. There is an immense amount of replayability and gameplay variations spread throughout the game to keep you unaware of you're current time of day. This is something that would also be perfect to have on a 3ds or PS Vita, no doubt. 

There is a consistent sense of humour spread throughout in this game that does not feel forced in anyway. It's been a while since I've laughed at a video game's content. (Glitches and dumb multiplayer high jinks doesn't count)

Yeah, it's a good game. Give it a look!"

												This game annoys me so much. When I get a gun, I have no bullets. When I get enough ammo to arm a whole army, I have no gun. When I'm low on food, raiders steal my food. I start with car nut, I get the worst car I've seen so far. I start with paranoid, team mates still constantly lie about stats. I'm offered a bunch of food, I only get 2. I get a new car, i don't have any gas for it. I get a bunch of gas, I lose my car. My team mate gets violently murdered by just a house cat. Yes I know it's supposed to be funny, but the game is harder than Dark Souls. At least in Dark Souls you can try to get better. In this though your only hope for survival is praying that stupid stuff doesn't murder you in your sleep because being nearly dead isn't dead enough for this game. I understand that it's supposed to be challenging, but I have no hope of winning. I have never made it past 3 days. I can't even get a fourth of the way there before getting murdered by some random creature, or commiting suicide! I still have hope though, that maybe one day something funny happens."

												Y'ALL BEST DROP FIFTEEN SPARE BUCKS ON THIS GAME IF YA KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YA.

Okay, southern accent aside [blame my upbringing], great af game. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥ to try and beat [throw in some dysentery and you have another Oregon Trail with zombies], but it's still fun. Granted, I grew up in the 90's/00's, not the 80's [this game's aesthetics], but in all honesty, the soundtrack will catch anyone's interest. Hell, just watch the trailer- it capture's the game's style PERFECTLY.

And the gameplay? Ohoho, the gameplay. You want all these zombies dead? Use weapons. Oh no, one of your party members wound up tired from a random encounter event! Time to let them sleep in the car! Oh no, now that you don't have your full party out looting, there're all these cool weapons lying around! Oh WOW! Is that a ninja?! Let's drop some food at her feet and recruit her! Ooh cool, it's Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson [the last bodybuilder]! Let's get fitness tips from him! What?! The ninja disappeared- but we can teleport with those smoke bombs she left behind!
This is all from a single playthrough of this game. I died on the last stretch as Papyrus from Undertale, having started out with Eggman and Metal Sonic from the Sonic franchise.

And for that matter, custom characters. You want to fight zombies as yourself? Well, here's as close as you'll get! Want a crossover of this and another popular game like Overwatch? Click that custom characters button [Starbound is also great for this, by the way].

tl;dr, this game's definitely worth its price. Only problem I have ewith it is that Starbound's been pulling more of my attention lately, haha."

												This game is amazing! Even on 'easy' it's still a great challenge and despite all the countless, horrorible deaths me and my friends and family in game went through, it was always fun to start it back up and try again. 

My only complaint(very minor though), is that when i have familar mode on, I only ever got 3 or 4 of the 8 characters i've made. Like the same few characters over and over and none of the others. 

If you still have doubts getting this game, just watch Projared play it and you'll be sold"

												A pretty solid release, actually. I went in expecting it to be a generic game with not a whole lot in the way of dynamic story or gameplay, but I got charmed by its atmosphere. Admittedly, the gameplay isn't much, but it's not inept or tedious enough for me to get mad at it. The dynamic story however is a great feature, as different orgeon-trail style events transpire to spice up gameplay. From intelligent dogs to Giant Farts Monthly, the game is never short on curveballs to therow at you. It's a genuinely funny game that doesn't lean too hard on reference humor. Also, side note, but the character customization is oodles of fun. I spent probably an hour or so just making my characters. The best part of it is that they can sometimes show up in the game, so Johnny Joes the master mechanic is not just tied down to being picked as my buddy. The gameplay is the only real weak point of this game, but it's perfectly passable and probably going to get better as the game grows (fingers crossed). There's worse ways to spend 15 bucks, and for what you get, I'd call it worth the asking price. I'd reccomend Death Road to Canada if you're looking for an Orgeon-Trail styled game with a lot of charm and hours upon hours of potential gameplay."

												Death Road to Canada is an absolutely adorable rouge-like game, despite the amount of spewing guts, bones and limbs flying everywhere around.
Imagine for a second Faster Than Light fused with Project Zomboid, plus ridiculous amount of cute humor. Nothing vulgar or dark. Biggest insult you'll encounter in this game is Dingus (and even that is not an insult :p).
There's almost not a single conversation in-game that didn't give me a little smile. 
Combat, and the whole game itself, is simple, minimalistic, non complex at all and still manages to be so addictive and amazing.
Today many games advertise on ""randomly generated"" marketing, but not as many manage to execute the mechanic well. Death Road to Canada is not bragging about it, yet it has one of the most impressive randomization mechanics I've ever seen in games.
When I said it has resemblance to FTL, it's not just about its replayability, but also the perfectly short campaign.
Games with replay value should be exactly like that. Short and interesting, and not have 1000s of hours per playthrough. My shortest (successful) playthorugh on normal difficulty was approximately 1.5 hours. I am yet to do the longer campaign mode, but am already eager to try it out after countless amounts of fails.
And speaking of fails, unlike many other rouge-like games, this one does not make you want to smash your keyboard againt the display when you lose. i can't quite explain why. Maybe it's the games general poistivity vibe, maybe it's because things lost are not so hard to gain. Maybe both.
And finally for someone like myself who is absolutely into retro games, this one will grab nostalgia by its weakest point. Amazing pixel art combined with great 8-bit soundtrack is a perfect formula to satisfy all the gamers dating way back from times of NES/Sega consoles.

Overall amazing. I have absolutely not a single complaint.
It's humorous, simple, minimalistic, beautiful and has got great replay value to it.

Passing a game like this is like a sin for every self respective gamer, to say the least"

												This game is amazing! Even on 'easy' it's still a great challenge and despite all the countless, horrorible deaths me and my friends and family in game went through, it was always fun to start it back up and try again. 

My only complaint(very minor though), is that when i have familar mode on, I only ever got 3 or 4 of the 8 characters i've made. Like the same few characters over and over and none of the others. 

If you still have doubts getting this game, just watch Projared play it and you'll be sold"

												I started off as a young athletic man with nothing to lose, riding solo in the zombie apocalypse or however you spell it. I looted a few stores here and there gathering food and medical supplies for my journey ahead. After gathering some supplies, a woman named Jetta wanted to join my group! I was excited and anxious to see what the future had in store for the two of us. We got along pretty well, she always told me to shut up, but I think she was just flirting. All of a sudden, our first siege came upon us! Luckily it wasn't too big of a horde and, I had gathered enough bullets for my pistol to hold off the zombies until we could escape. We made it out alive, our first siege. We had been through a lot after only being together for a day or two. I think our relationship was really beginning to blossom! We were getting closer and closer to Canada, we could taste the free health care. Then another lone survivor came across my group! His name was Drew and he claimed that he had a very skilled background in medicine! I was happy to hear that because a doctor is always a plus in the zombie apocalypse! 

Me, Drew, Jetta, fighting through grocery stores and small towns in search of more supplies to aid us in our survival. After looting some stores, we came across the greatest loot we would ever find, his name, Alessandro, the most loyal creature in the world, Alessandro the hero hound. The 4 of us continued on our journey, we were running low on medical supplies, and Jetta was very low on health, living on the edge between life and death. We stopped in a junk yard in the hopes of finding more medical supplies, and more gas. The horde here was massive, it wasn't looking good for the group. We rummaged through old broken down cars and piles of rubble, no medical supplies, but I did find a safe with a bunch of gas so that helped. I wanted to stay a little longer to see if we could find anything to heal Jetta. That was when I knew that I made a horrible mistake, we were cornered, the only way out was through a horde of 40+ zombies. Swinging our hatchets and kitchen knives we fought as hard as we could through the horde to try and get Jetta out and to safety, but...it was too late, Jetta's baseball bat snapped in the middle of the horde...One bite to the neck...Jetta went down. The zombies began ripping her to shreds, all we could do was watch. We had to get out of there before the zombies got to us too, ""BARK! BARK!"" Alessandro said as we drove off from the junkyard. A truly emotional loss for the group, but its survival of the fittest and we had to move on. 

Right after our junkyard disaster we came across a SIEGE! I was low on health and I had no ammo for my pistol. Drew had a strange looking orange knife and I thought to myself, WOW HE HAS SOME SORT OF LEGENDARY WEAPON, but no...it was just a rusty machete. The siege horde was massive, and we were stuck in a building with no rooms. Zombies came flooding in through the door, we hacked away at their rotting heads hoping to make it out alive! I was down to my last few breaths, I was exhausted from swinging my hatchet, my hits were doing no damage, I had to run into another corner to recuperate while Drew and Alessandro kept fighting. I regained my strength and dove back into the zombies, FOR ALESSANDRO!!! I yelled. Drew was slightly offended but he didn't have time to get angry, because a zombie had grabbed me by the leg right as I dove into the horde. I went down, as the zombies ate away at my insides and I let out my final screams of life, I heard Drew and Alessandro scamper out of the house, they made it out alive. 

Then there were two, Drew and Alessandro the hero hound. Their drive to their next location did not last long, they came across an impassable obstacle, they were doomed, and they knew it from the start, it was...The River of Death. Drew and Alessandro ran into the wet, dark, zombie filled maze. Alessandro sprinted ahead to find an escape route while Drew followed far behind fighting through the zombies with an old kitchen knife. Alessandro needed help fighting the zombies and was also having trouble finding an escape route, so he ran back to find Drew. They met eyes from across the hall...there was a look of shock on Drew's face, he had nowhere to run, zombies were latched on to his legs. He was dragged to the floor as almost a hundred zombies hurried to his corpse to get their long awaited meal. 

Alessandro knew he couldn't stay in this hell hole. He was low on health and didn't know if he would make it out alive, but he had to try. He ran as fast as he could dodging left and right between massive groups of zombies. He busted through 3 or 4 doors trying to find the light to the outside. He knew he was getting close, but he could hear zombies all around him, his adrenalin spiked and he began to run faster than he had ever run before. Alessandro ran through a door into a long empty hallway, he was home free! He thought he was...the hallway ran out...the splashes of water coming from hundreds of zombies filled the room at the end of the hallway. With zombies in front of him marching towards, and plenty of zombies still hungry from Drew's devouring, Alessandro had no choice. He had to hope that there was a door to the outside through this massive crowd, he went for it. The zombies grabbed at him and snatched at his weak legs hoping to bring him down just like they did to Drew. Alessandro could see the light! The doorway to freedom! The road to Canada was just in front of him waiting to be taken on for at least a bit longer! He was almost out of the horde, he could smell the air from outside, he kicked it into high gear! Sprinting for his life and hoping to avenge the others and make it to Canada! Alessandro knew he had made it past the horde, until...he felt a tug at his leg, he FLEW BACK into the horde!! Alessandro yelped and howled for his friends, but they were all gone, the dream of making it to Canada was lost. RIP Alessandro, we will never forget you,

If you have read up to this point, thank you very much, this took me forever to write. Awesome first playthrough, and I expect there will be many more to come, thanks for reading my story, also buy this game it's really fun!

12/10 would run mindlessly through giant zombie horde with no health again."

												Disclaimer: I received this pre-release copy from backing the original Kickstarter.

Death Road To Canada is Oregon Trail. That's all it is. It's a weird simplified Oregon Trail-esque game with modern comedy writing and wacky events in lieu of normal strategic planning and ""realistic"" events like injuries and diseases. Now, you may be thinking, ""Isn't this just Organ Trail? Why do we need multiple games for this one extremely niche market?"" First of all, why don't we need multiple games, second of all, what we've got here is a pretty solid game.

There are two phases to the game: traveling and the choices you make on the road, and scavenging for supplies on the open road. Traveling works the way any similar random game works, be it Oregon Trail or FTL or Convoy or whatever. You will find rest places or bandits or teammates on the open road, and decide who to barter with, what to trust, who to tell to COOL IT (from personal experience, there's basically never a reason to tell anyone to COOL IT, which is a shame). The scavenging, in my opinion, is where the real heart of the game lies. Here you are in full control, weaving past hordes of the undead and rummaging through any house you can find in search of food, gas, health, ammo, and the occasional weapon. Combat is a last resort, as ammo is limited and all weapons have a chance of breaking (the AI apparently did not get this memo, as it will move to smack any zombie that comes within smacking distance, even if all they have at their disposal is an old umbrella or a femur). House maps are generated from random rooms, whose floor plans defy the laws of known physics with rooms that overlap each other and lead to god knows where. It's silly. It takes getting used to.

Of course, any game following in the old footsteps of good old ""terrible death is educational"" will stumble onto the same problems as its predecessors: everything is left to the whims of the RNG, and the RNG hates your stupid surviving face. If your team has high morale, whoops, here's an event that drops everyone's morale. Got a surplus of food? Be a shame if some bandits were to get in your way. What's that? You have a car with gas? What do you think this is, Daytona USA? Sometimes while you're driving, characters will just argue with each other and lower their morale. Having an RNG that doesn't basically cheat certainly isn't easy, but typically there's some kind of middle ground. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure erred on the side of ""too easy"", though primarily that was due to gameplay being more based on skill than luck. In Death Road To Canada, the skill-based sections are enjoyable, but the luck-based ones are just a reminder to properly lubricate before making your decision.

I do have to give this game props where it's due: for a zombie game, it does a good job at making a proper zombie atmosphere. The zombies are many and travel in hordes, and there's a thick VHS film grain that covers the screen giving it a classic Romero graphic look. (And yes, it can be turned off.) The one real surprising outlier is the music, which for whatever reason is some arcadey honky-tonk that adds to the game's ""quirkiness"", and if that's the kinda word that makes your stomach crawl up your esophagus, you might as well look elsewhere. The whole game's about being quirky, from constant references to being ""swole"" to the ability to play as a car-driving dog. This here is the silly version of Organ Trail, that's the name it's made for itself and that's how I enjoy it. (I mean, enjoying is sort of a relative term. I enjoy it as long as the game allows me to enjoy it before throwing me into a ditch and stealing my ♥♥♥♥.)


Bottom line: this game is a game of Russian Roulette at some twisted carnival with the biggest teddy bear if you last five rounds. It's a twelve inch novelty ♥♥♥♥♥, and it's made of cubes because this game has a quirky pixel art style. And if you're the kind of masochistic thrill seeker who's into that stuff, then this is a fine way to spend your evening."

												If there's one thing I've learned about zombie apocalypses, it's that hardly anyone makes it out alive. 

Especially Carol, my Uzi-wielding wiener dog. 

The fact that a dog can wield an Uzi and broker deals with bandits makes this game delightfully random in the best of ways. 

10/10, would play Carol the Uzi-wielding wiener dog again."

												I absolutely loved this game and I keep coming back for more!

Pros:
-Great happy soundtrack to sets the atmsophere and makes it feel like a fun road trip!
-Cute jokes and humor all over the place
-Inventive traits and perks
-Dogs as playable characters!!!
-Simple gameplay at first glance, but can be mastered to get better at the game

Cons:
-Wrong combinations of characters can be really penalizing.
-Sometimes the RNG can really be harsh
-Random events can really screw up your team and things can get worse real quick
-AI can sometimes act strangely (using guns when I ask to use melee) or get stuck


Get this game if you like:
-Rogue-likes
-A zombie game with a happy atmosphere
-Binding of Isaac
-Feeling empowered when you little gang of allies kill zombies with you
-...or dodging zombies and gathering resources"

												This game has already brought me so much fun !

First off, the soundtrack :

It may not be the one you'd expect from a game depicting the fall of society and travelling in a deadly environment where you can die any day.
It's more one of an action-packed loot-and-run, inexplicable event-riddled road trip between friends (or are they?) soundtrack, holding a lot of energy and generally transmitting that ""Let's freaking do it"" vibe. I love it, and like listening to it outside of the game from time to time. You can also access it easily in the game files.

The graphics :

I personally like a lot good pixel art, and this one is truly good ! I don't really know what i could add, plus you can easily see for yourself. Pixels done right.

The gameplay :

Movements are fluid, there are a good choice of ways to deal with the zombies when it comes to the action part of the game, such as the classic melee weapons, pistols, shotguns, rifles. You can also sometimes manage to find molotovs, pipe bombs, grenades etc... Moreover, some characters have specific ways to (or not to!) deal with  zombies and get all that sweet loot.
Your ai teammates, if you choose to take any with you during looting missions are good at following you around, managing their stamina (as in not killing non threatening zombies) and shouldnt die stupidly too often.
The only issues i've encountered yet are some with the depths, for example when you think a zombie is farther than you vertically than it really is, and also sometimes walls ""hitboxes"" taking melee hits instead of zombies.

In the other part of the game, wich is managing your road trip across zombinated states toward canada, you are faced with events and a couple of choices. Theses can range to bandit attacks, zombie sieges, picking your looting location, recruiting or not the random survivors you come across along the road, and much more.
This is in my opinion the hardest part of the game, as i've lost more good men to bandits and unfortunate events than zombies, but it's not frustrating at all. You can generally move along without too much damage if your group doesnt have someone able to deal with the situation, and it generally rewards good thinking, instead of having randomly generated outcomes which you don't have control of. To summarize, choices are not always easy, but it's not frustrating either.

There is also a possibility of local coop, but having not tested it I cannot say if it's good or bad, though I'd say having that possibility is a nice plus !

Replayability :

I absolutely guarantee you won't see everyting there is to see in your first playthrough. You most likely won't win it either. There is a lot of elements, characters, items and events to discover, and also a few gamemodes available from the start. Custom characters are a nice addition, and the perks available are progressively upgraded as you play the game. Don't think they are useless from the start either.
I have yet to play the game more, but at roughly 5 hours of play I did not get bored of it for a second, so I'd say the game does have a lot of hours of fun ahead for you.

Overall one of the most fun ""little"" games i've played in a long time. The gameplay, immersion, music are all very good and the humor make this game unique and lovable."

												Not much to say, just wanna add another review to the pile for this great game.

My #1 complaint is poor AI companion pathfinding, and with such a small team, it may be a while before they can really sort it out. But the updates so far have been very encouraging, so if you can get over some unfair deaths and losses and just look forward to trying new stuff on the next run, I can't recommend this enough."

												Death Road to Canada is an amazing game where you attempt to take a car full of jerks to the Canadian border so they can live out their blissful existence free from the American zombies. Along the way, you'll find talking dogs, kawaii Anime girls, and a buttload of other crazy characters that make the game ridiculously entertaining. There is a lot of replay value and though I haven't tried co-op yet, that seems quite entertaining as well. I'd like to include an anecdote, but instead I'll just list a few things that have happened to me in this game in the few hours I've played it:

[SOME SPOILERS]
-Had a character possesed by a Demon
-Met an Alien who helped us blast through undead
-Had a character die because they attempted to pull out a loose tooth
-Had a moose chuckle at my characters, then kill them
-Told too many people to ""cool it""
-Opened way too many toilets, expecting too much each time
-Had my dreams of reaching Canada destroyed before my eyes 

I've yet to reach Canada (my most recent playthrough was my closest, with my Demon-Possesed Debutante reaching the final mission before becoming zombie chow) so it is challenging but after a brief break, I always return to the game, telling myself that I will make it ""this time.""

EDIT: After 14 hours, I finally made it to Canada with my custom character (Hank) and a whole lotta luck.

8/10 Recommended."

												Death Road to Heart Attack

This here is a short quirky like zombie survival story with packed replayability with the multiple modes you can choose to activate for your run. 
No one cares about the rest though because there is one mode that will make you think you are dying! 
In DR2C there is a mode that allows you to create avatars with limited visual cusomization paired with an expertise or something like that and a trait option. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMIRY! SO I myself did so. The mode called familiar faces made it so the charac ters you would encounter would first pull from the pool of all your ""friends and family.""
In short I went on an adventure with familiar peoples in an intense situation. There were laughs, we would argue. At times we wouldn't speak to each other, or maybe we would discuss art and the moon nonstop. The characters attitude variations may not be exact on point, but when you see it, it is close enough. I felt their fear and screams as we lost our car to bandits, when we were chased to our new graves inside that damn bar. I have PTSD now 10/10 this ♥♥♥♥ is better than the christopher walkin dead!!!"

												A very fun game, but not without it's faults. 

While I enjoy each run I do, mostly due to the excellent soundtrack and humor, I've yet to actually reach Canada, though. Pretty much every time I get to the last day I've been stopped by an overwhelmingly huge siege of zombies in a tiny room, and my team dies pretty quickly afterwards. Not sure if the final massive wave is a set event or if I'm just unlucky, since my sample size is admittedly pretty small. It might be this game's version of Oregon Trail's river challenge, but unlike dodging rocks on a river, a siege of that size seems kinda impossible to complete.

I get that it's a survival game (which is one of the main things keeping me from becoming frustrated with bad RNG,) but I feel like the difficulty curve makes it really hard to recommend this to a general audience. If you're a results-driven person who needs to win to have fun or feel a sense of accomplishment, I think this game would be very frustrating. If you're okay with just seeing how far you can get and letting the trip ride out while enjoying some excellent music, I think you'd have a pretty good time. That said - even while I enjoy the journey, I feel like my best runs would be much more satisfying if I actually felt as if I had any chance of succeeding near the end. I have a really fun time playing, but it's sort of disappointing to have a run where you play/manage your resources well to only have the game tell you ""nah, not this time, buddy.""

What I'm saying is, it's a fun game, and a good way to burn some time, but could be a lot more satisfying with a rebalance patch or a casual mode. Either could make the game much more accessible, I think."

												Watched peanutbutter gamer, space hamster (pb&jeff) and Projared play this game and had to try it out.
I love the art style and unsubtle referential humour.
The sequence of events is in constant flux and all character perks feel useful in at least some situations.
Great co-op gameplay for two people and I feel like it could be ported to console for 4 player couch co-op (something lacking in todays market)

Would recommend to people who like to laugh and experience those moments of terror when you're surrounded on all sides, your out of bullets and that 2x4 just broke as you're friend was devoured before your eyes....

												So you think you can make it to Canada eh? Think you're high and mighty, capable of waltzing through the undead hordes with both skill and style? Well how about you COOL IT! and take a seat right there, cause getting to Canada ain't no picnic!

I've tried reaching Canada several times now; some tries more successful than others. From times where there was plenty of food, but where health slowly ticked away after every encounter. To times where I had plenty of health yet my group slowly died of hunger.

No this ain't Canada, it's the US of A; where the zombie virus affect both man and machine. Because cars seem to fail after ten miles and aluminum bats SNAP! at the speed of sound. As if God himself stacked the odds against you! And I'm not even mentioning the SIEGE!s.

Don't be fooled, this is a hard game, and when you play it long enough you will become familiar with these two words: Dang it!

Pros:
-Highly enjoyable if you have a slightly wacky (and maybe even macabre) sense of humor.
-Plain old enjoyable if you don't.
-Quite hard, (though at times luck based.)
-Very active devs, seriously. (As of writing; working actively to fix some bugs that snuck in release)

Cons:
-(Quite hard, though) at times luck based.
-Some weaponry breaks way too fast/randomly. In one of my new games; a character broke their starting weapon after one hit.

In short:
Personally love it; would get into a car made of aluminum foil, tell random people to COOL IT!, and get eaten while trying to drive to Canada again."

												Lots of games have made me lose faith that developers even care about what they put into their games anymore. 
Death Road to Canada restores that faith in me.

If I were to sum up this entire game in two scenes that happened in this game, it would be these two.

A dog named Hershel told some guy with a shotgun to ""Cool It!,"" and then proceeeded to fart in this guy's face. This causes the guy to have an emotional breakdown, question what he's been doing with his life, and through some line of thinking, gives the dog his prized autoshotgun.

The same dog, Hershel, told a band of bandits to ""Cool It!,"" and the bandits completely forgot they were robbing the rest of my team, and just brutally murdered Hershel.

10/10
Made me feel more emotions than most games these days."

												My favorite thing to do in this game is make tons of custom characters of everyone I know, online and offline. There's a gameplay mode that prioritizes your custom characters. It makes for a lot of fun, running into everyone you know in the game and seeing their horrible or sometimes awesome fate."

												Create Cesar Milan as a playable character, giving him friend of dog and charming. Playing in Familiar Faces Mode. Recruit Cesar Milan the dogwhisperer, and he's a swell guy, frequently boosting group morale and talking his way out of situations. We don't encounter any dogs after recruiting him. Then, things get messy during an escape and he gets grabbed by a hoarde as the car pulls away... The very next day we find a pet shop filled with non-hostile feral dogs and their treasure trove of bones. 

Could have had a squad of dogs trained by Cesar Milan, instead there was just tragedy and woe.

Thus is life on the Death Road to Canada...."

Wonderfully hilarious.

-The combat

I'll jump straight to the main point...
You spend a lot of time fighting in this game so the combat system is gonna make or break the game for you... It's simplistic but you can't exactly button mash your way through. Which is a good thing. Repetitive swings will deplete your stamina so a weaker character will tire fast. It's a fun romp and the humor and soundtrack will win plenty of people over."

												I have a list that is mostly based on playing with a friend right in the room.

Pros:
-has a nice style of art, pretty good custom characters
-has some pretty jammin' music
-few buttons to map but enough things to keep you engaged with those few buttons, really easy to set up your controllers
-has several different playing modes, and harder modes to unlock as you beat those
-isn't some game that let's you skirt by being a lazy sack, you need to put a little effort to actually win
-amusing little dialogue chunks throughout going to Canada

Cons:
-your co-op partner can be scripted to just... leave...
-if one of you dies, your friend might be sitting out for awhile without playing
-if you rush out of a room due to a swarm, your friend's character automatically begins to rely on a slow AI trod to that room you went to and there is a good chance they're going to die in there since the AI isn't THAT smart and they still are getting eaten by zombies on a screen you can't even see

I guess what I recommend is that maybe the game can recognise there is more than one player and maybe not make certain events where their character just bails on the story... Also maybe make it so when one player goes in another room, the other person can follow right after so they won't immediately die because they decided to slowly follow.

I plan to play this game more, as it has only been a few rounds of dying horribly, but I'm trying to make this work with two people better. Maybe as we get better..."

												A pretty solid release, actually. I went in expecting it to be a generic game with not a whole lot in the way of dynamic story or gameplay, but I got charmed by its atmosphere. Admittedly, the gameplay isn't much, but it's not inept or tedious enough for me to get mad at it. The dynamic story however is a great feature, as different orgeon-trail style events transpire to spice up gameplay. From intelligent dogs to Giant Farts Monthly, the game is never short on curveballs to therow at you. It's a genuinely funny game that doesn't lean too hard on reference humor. Also, side note, but the character customization is oodles of fun. I spent probably an hour or so just making my characters. The best part of it is that they can sometimes show up in the game, so Johnny Joes the master mechanic is not just tied down to being picked as my buddy. The gameplay is the only real weak point of this game, but it's perfectly passable and probably going to get better as the game grows (fingers crossed). There's worse ways to spend 15 bucks, and for what you get, I'd call it worth the asking price. I'd reccomend Death Road to Canada if you're looking for an Orgeon-Trail styled game with a lot of charm and hours upon hours of potential gameplay."

												This game is incredible. I have been waiting for a fun, casual, text driven adventure that doesn't hold your hand the whole way. Some people might not like the random elements to the game, but I think they are fantastic. The content and writing of these events and dialogue are well written. They keep driving me back for more!

2. More loot in toilets
3. Dogs need less food"

												I beat the game twice one time on regular and Familiar Characters Mode out of the 25 run. Very funny on the thing you pick can save your butt most of the time. Alway keep up morale or your character start to leave by steal your supplies. Game is good but the game make it you have to have all slot fill or a S*** load of zombies are gonna f*** you up like you run out of breath be all red and can't swing your weapons. Best tip when you rob, rob people that are trading for food or gas. Never rob the weapon master cause  most of the time they will kill you or your hold group takes 2 damage.

Over all this game end really fast depends on your character and their ability to stay calm or be stronger with melee weapon or start with better weapon. Can customize your own characters. Wish i had more place to explore to get more supplies cause only one or two house fill with junk just makes it harder to beat the game. I give it a 4 out of 5.

P.s NEVER ADD JASON TO YOUR TEAM....."

												I played for my Lunch. Pretty good. 

Story and universe are immersive and ''possible'' enough. (sorry I'm french so my english is horrible).

I play with xbox 360. For the gameplay it work fine. In the menu, its horrible. Still playable tought. One patch away from being good. Maybe the dev love the keyboard, but the it feel more natural to play with the xbox controller.

The difficulty seem pretty good. IN the first playthrougth It took a long before I loose. After my defeat, I jumped immediably right into it.

My general comment on the layout. Close the door of the can't enter house. Sometime you can pass over the junk pile, sometime you can't. It's confusing.

Will play again and will try the multiplayer."

												Saw some gaming YouTube channels I regularly watch play it, thought it was cool (especially since I'm fond of roguelikes), and added it to my wishlist on Steam and kind of forgot about it. 

Cue Autumn sale. Decided to buy it. Let it sit in my library for about a week or so before deciding to play.

All I can say is this: WOW.

Right from the start, it's pretty damn good. Nothing says ""awesome"" like slashing through zombies while going north (Though a zombie apocalypse seems more like an average day in Florida anyways). Sure, I haven't had too many runs so far, but they were surprisingly kind of intense. Every death sucks, especially in the times where I've gotten so far, but that's roguelikes for you, and that's why I love them.

Also, I'm Alexandra the resilient martial artist with a kitchen knife. Can't beat that."

												Played Organ Trail? It's an excellent redo of the old Oregon Trail, except Zombie-themed. I love the game, it's interesting and dark and grim in a beautiful way. Highly recommended.

Now strip away the dark and grim, overcaffeinate it, jack it up with that unique style of methamphetamine crazy, and add an uptempo soundtrack, and you get Death Road to Canada. Even more recommended.

This lovely little thing has had me drop multiple other triple-A games I'd been playing to focus here almost exclusively. I have yet to successfully reach the glorious Canadian utopia, but for all my losses I haven't once felt discouraged or frustrated. You fire it up and go again, probably laughing at whatever it was that was your demise. It keeps the humor coming, and it is simultaneously hilariously out of place, and yet completely in tune with the crazy aesthetic. The replayability of this is off the scale for several different reasons. 

I love this game. My kid also loves this game. This is exactly what the Zombie trope needed."

												I may not have that many runs in yet but this game is great. My best run so far was when my buddy had dog friend as a perk and kept attracting dogs to the cause. About five days in I felt I was doing well then it happened. A seige completly devasted me killing the two humans in my party. One getting trapped in the horde and the other overcome by the grief of losing his partner charged head first shooting his shotgun as much as possible. All the while my lassy dog fighting with all its heart trying to save who ever was left. It only lasted seconds though the lassy all that remained. Making a getaway just as the horde closed in the dog was all I had left. Then my lassy decided it was time to stick those keys into the ignition and drive. The next day my lassy was mauled by a moose it was trying to help and thus ended my best run. 10/10"

												Everything happened so quickly. Me and my group fell dead in an instant, and it was all my fault. 

     It started with just me and my brother. We were driving along, with about as much supplies as one would want at the start of their journey. Enough to instill hope for the long and arduous journey ahead. That is until I committed the most horrid Iniquity known to the modern man. 

     I farted

     I looked to my brother and I saw hatred in his eyes. In a panic I did what any strong man within a life or death situation would do. I blamed the other. Reluctantly, my brother accepted it without argument. We both knew I was the culprit, but we were close enough that such a large fault could be overlooked. However, it did put a deal of strain on our relationship. 

     We traveled further, fighting against the zombie horde. Until I came across my girlfriend, trying in vain to push open a door clearly labeled ""pull"". Me and my brother's morale had been beaten down, we were in dire need of an ally to help push back against the coming darkness. For a moment I contemplated leaving her behind. Her low level of intelligence could prove to be our downfall But, I glanced down to the small stuffed penguin she had given me as a gift. I still kept it around, she always knew I was fond of penguins and risked her life to scavenge one after all the shops had been raided. It seemed strange that people would leave behind such a valuable item in a zombie infested wasteland. It seemed to beg me to take her with us. So we welcomed her to the group and continued on our way to Canada. 

     Days went by with much success. With her help we had been able to scrounge up enough resources to last us a while. Everything seemed to be looking for us. That was of course, until yet again someone broke wind. For a brief moment we all eyed each other. The friendship and loyalty I once saw gave way to anger and suspicion. Not once, but twice someone had broken the sacred oath to keep that which was meant for the bathroom, in the bathroom. I was not responsible this time, but that would not stop the group from blaming me. Pinning the blame on another would not work this time. Then, a glimmer of hope appeared, I could have my girlfriend attempt to ""deduce"" who had farted. I never thought she was particularly stupid, but if I was correct, I could line up the ""evidence"" to ensure the blame did not fall on me. I could avoid becoming more broken without sacrificing what precious little relationships I had left. I did as planned, and my girlfriend figured out who farted.

     Me.

     Then I saw something in her eyes. Glee. SHE had been the one who farted. It was HER fault. But I could not argue with her. I had underestimated her, I fell for her trap, and had allowed her to avoid the blame without risk, However, my brother was convinced and the matter was settled. Had she feigned idiocy this entire time? How much of her word could I trust now that I knew she was so willing to blame others for her own farts? I looked down to my sentimental stuffed penguin. How could I trust that this penguin was even a quality store product? It must have been shameful replica designed for the sole purpose of earning my trust. Yes, I could see it now. The eyes were slightly discolored and the head was tilted at an angle. It was a lie.

     How long had she been maintaining this facade? Was my brother deceiving me as well? I would not let this stand. I planned to escape the hordes of zombies with the supplies and leave the others to suffer. One could blame another for one's farts, but if one gives another a stuffed penguin that is anything below store quality THAT was inexcusable. Unfortunately, in planning to escape the future horde along with abandoning my group. I inadvertently landed me into a horde that was right in front of us. You’d think a large mass of writhing undead would be hard to miss, but alas my wrath had blinded me.

     There was no mercy in that shambling wood cabin. The undead beat down the roof and walls. They broke in from every part that they could. We fought as hard as we could. My girlfriend was the first to fall, then my brother. Both became nothing more than a mass of broken flesh beneath a horde of savage creatures. Finally, as I fell to the hordes around me, as they feasted on my flesh, two simple words left my mouth before those creatures tore my body apart.

												Let's be honest, zombie games are overdone. The genre is congested with stale, uninspired, boring and pointlessly challenging games that make this over saturated part of the market even more and more irrelevant.  But this game, with its goofy atmosphere, upbeat music  and charming art style, is breathing new life into this undead genre.
Death Road to Canada is an easy game to pick up, an easy one to learn, but even harder to put down. The rogue-like adventure/survival aspects make every play through of this game different and interesting. And with the custom character feature, you are given the power to generate so many more possibilities as you experiment to see who works well with whom.
Part of the reason this game is so easy to fall in love with is the culmination of its dorky sense of humor and catchy OST. For some unforeseeable reason, the chiptune music pairs perfectly with a game about blood, guts and survival. And the possibly fatal decisions you are making on the road turn from frustrating to hilarious due to the comical writing. Never before has a fart been the catalyst that led to my character's downfall, and for that reason alone this game deserves an award. 
I have but two complaints. First is that the RNG can sometimes ruin you. Often you are left with decisions while driving; do you surrender food or fight the bandits? Abandon the car or attempt to fix it? etc, etc. But at times you come to a decision where the solution involves shooting or other skills, and by some cruel twist of fate the character making this decision is the least proficient marksman. And you can't change that. This has never ruined the experience for me, mind you. With these decisions, the game is often fair. All of my failures are my own, not the game's. Save one instance, this is also my second complaint. For some reason, when the AI characters encounter a weapon they already have they get stuck in a perpetual loop of weapon switching. This doesn't happen too often, but when traveling the mall I had two characters of mine get stuck in this loop with umbrellas which resulted in their deaths. This led to a slippery slope which ended in a game over. So beware of that.
Ultimately this game is more than worth your time and money. It's fair yet challenging. It's more fun than frustrating. And it's highly addictive. Give it a chance, especially if you love other rogue games like Binding of Isaac and things of that ilk. I'd also like to recommend checking out more of Rocketcat's games. I enjoy playing their mobile games, and I look forward to see what these devs will do in the future.
TL;DR
Good game. Happy chiptune music. Dog's use crowbars. Farts can be fatal. This game is rife with references to different shows/games/etc. Cat video magazines are a thing in this game and I'm sad that they aren't real."

												-it was an average day. or so i thought.
-zombies invaded our town so i knew i had to escape to a place with no zombies, canada.
-i took a long a buddy named greg with me to canada. greg was a great  mechanic and doctor so i knew he'd be  perfect
-all was going well, we looted several places, stocked up on food, gas, and medical equipment
-along the road i spotted a dog. i recruited the dog, raliegh, to the team as we had more then enough food
-raleigh was extremely trustworthy and we used him to bride bandits and what not
-we continue our trek to canada, fending off hordes of zombies whilst collecting loots
-we then met peter on the side of the street alone
-knowing we had alot of food we thought another person wouldnt hurt us
-hes a fighter, lets recruit him they said
-look how big he is they said
-he'll be perfect they said
-so we allowed peter to join even though i really did not want to
-none the less he was a fighter and a warrior, and he really helped out the team
-or so we thought
-i began to get excited, as we had plenty of supplies and only 4 days left
-i began to trsut peter, and knowing he was a good shot, i gave him a gun
-and that was all good
-but what happened next will haunt me for the rest of my life
-we ran into a town, and in a house the was a grenade
-at the time i had never used a grenade, so  igave it to peter
-and that was the worst mistake of my life
-the next time we encountered a horde, and just as it looked like we deafeted it, we had not
-peter, who i had begun to trust had turned sides, a traitor as some may say
-he threw the grenade right at all of our feet
-he had instantly killed himself and greg, and severly injured me and raleigh
-flashbacks began to cross my mind of my vietnam days
-me and raleigh believed petercould have been apart of isis
-as we sit there half dead the zombies began to enclosure us
-me and raleigh could not escapeand had died

10/10 would trust an isis member again

												Ever wanted to play as a dog and collect passangers? Wanted to drive the open road and get a demon dog as a friend? You and a friend can do that. You can collect a ton of unique weapons and travel the open road to CANADA! It's great fun. I suggest everyone to get it. It's a solid fun game and it's even just as entertaining when you're on your last stretch in the game. Seriously. Worth the $15. It's tons of random events and it really delivers it! Hilarious situations and silly companions."

												I been playing this game on and off my stream for a couple days now. I been hosting races as well. I bought this game blindly over the simple fact that the name spoke to me, and I am glad I did. With me being a huge zombie fan and actually moving to Canada in a month I just had to get it. Every run I have of this game I am smiling, laughing, or genuinely worried.

Now let's talk about the game. It's very fun! Like Oregon Trail but with the action sequences reminding me of Gauntlet or any over the top action game. I never truly feel safe, which is a good thing. Anything can happen, for example, have a lot of food? Well sorry you had a hole in your bag. Doing okay on health? Feral cats attack. The humor and randomness make this game feel unique. The game is simple and easy to learn but hard enough that I failed every run thus far. I encountered a few issues here and there but nothing game breaking, I considered it apart of the adventure. 

When I first streamed this game my viewers loved it and a few purchased it. They been playing a lot and not one of them has anything really negative to say. So this review is technically coming from 7 or so people. Out of what I seen between us all, none of us have gotten further then day 1 remaining and the variety makes each trip special. We all made each other in the cute character creator and go on the adventure with another. It gives us stories and funny screen shots to share. We all love Death Road To Canada!

TL:DR I turned into a Dogataur would highly recommend! 10/10 Poutines."

												I don't normally review games, sorry if this is a little rough around the edges, for a short written review. 


TL;DR: ""You like Rouge-like games? You like funny things? Buy this, yo.""

I've already spent several hours in the game, and am still far from getting bored with the game, there's so much to love.

The Story:

Very Straightforward, your goal is to get from Canada, from the US (I want to say you start in Florida). However, like many things in life, the story's more about the journey, than the destination. You'll be creating your own story along the way, from choosing how to handle a roadside robbery, to kick certain members out of the group when they complain about the ride too much, to wether or not to give that seemingly pretty friendly dog a knife. 

Gameplay:

The gameplay is fairly straightforward in Death Road. The game is perma-death, meaning once you lose a character, until you start another run they're gone for good.

There are a set of skills in the game that are rolled mostly randomly for all characters, from being able to repair your car to how you handle certain weapons. These stats come into play in a variety of different way throughout the game. 

 Your character(s) have two three major types of weapons they can use. 
1) Melee weapons. Almost all melee weapons will make you tired after repeated use, which takes a few moments before you can really start swinging at the undead spooks again. Most Melee weapons will also break after a certain period of time.
2) Guns. Totally rad. Guns are awesome in every way. Except they take from a preeeeeeeeetty limited supply of bullets. Some runs you're going to have next to no bullets, sometimes you'll have...no bullets. Later on you'll be gathering enough to reliably use them, but conserve ammo wisely.
3) Throwables, from grenades to Molotovs, these help clear a massive wave of zombies. They can also hurt your friends. Found that out the hard way. 

You're charged with fighting horde after horde of the Zombie menace, scavenging for much needed food, fuel, weapons, and ammo. Each character can only take 3 bites from a zombie before they turn into some new lunch meat, so zombies can fairly consistantly pose a large threat in big enough numbers. Getting swarmed and surrounded from all sides will mean almost certain death,

Music:

Aaaahhhhhhh the music is great in this game. It's an awesome contrast from the pretty bleak situation your characters find themselves in, and its actually really enjoyable to listen to while managing your inventory, and making important choices like who should get the first bite of that candy bar. 

Extra Things Worth Mentioning:

Two major things stand out to me that I think are worth bringing up, the Humor and the Character Creator.

The Humor in Death Road is phenominal. Several moments in the game had me actually laughing out loud, atracting the unwanted attention of curious family members. One of my favorite examples of this is:

One of the events your party can experence is stopping by a campsite, and telling ghost stories to one another. However, in one of my runs, only a single character remained, but I saw the ""Tell ghost stories"" option was still there. Assuming it would act like I had more than one party memeber, I clicked it, and was pleasantly supprised by the special dialouge, where half-way through my character discovered he was telling his story to ghosts the entire time. 

The Charactor Creator is also a huge pro in my book. You can create and save up to (roughly) 16 charactes. You can customize several things about these characters, from their looks, to their outlook on life. You can choose to take One or Two of these characters with you at the begining of the game, or instead chose to randomize your starting cast. You will rarely run into your characters you created when you encounter random people throughout the course of the game, making it a very special treat to run into that weird 12th grade teacher you chose to spend 15 minutes creating in a video game. 


All in all I really, really loved the game, and highly suggest it to anyone interested in rougelikes, zombies, or even just fun in general. The game oozes quality, from the random times you'll find yourself bartering with dogs with guns to when you choose to end an argument by driving a car into a tree."

												Death Road To Canada is an action rpg that has alot of charm and reminded me of a modern Oregon Trail game. You have some very tough decisions to make on you're journey to Canada that really effect the game and there are also some sections that have action oriented gameplay and zombies all over the place, the game can get brutal!

Don't let the cute, old school pixel style graphics fool you, it is very challenging and will keep you on you're toes at all times. The dialogue is well written, the game is very funny and random events are all very well done.

You have to manage you're group of people as you try and make it from Florida to Canada. Like Oregon Trail before it, you must manage many things, including fuel, weapons, guns and food. One aspect I love, that I mentioned above is some of the tough choices you have, which remind me of a good rpg. 

Each game has been very different so far and I can see a good amount of replay value to this game. Did I mention make you're decisions wisely? Sometimes things as small as letting someone join you're group, to going to find loot and losing one or all of you're group members.

Sometimes the vehicle will break down, if one of you're characters is a mechanic they can fix it, if you get jumped by bandits you must make the decision to pass over of you're hard each food/gas/ammo to the bandits or attack them. All of the random events and choices are very welll written to and alot of the time are very hard choices that take a little while to decide what you want to pick. 

You will also have to pick weither to stop and check out some houses or stores along you're way, sure it would be nice to get some more food, ammo or gas but at what cost? You might get jumped by the zombies and it could all end there. Do you check out the city or keep driving and going to the next one? 

If you have a friend or family member around you can also get them to hop in at times and control one of you're gorup members. One aspect I wish this game had was coop for people that are not in the same house. Local coop is cool but boy would this be fun with friends from other countries or cities. The other aspect I had some issues with was the crashes, I had 4 or 5 crashes during my many hours on the game. And lastly, the controls for keyboard and mouse could be improved, thankfully it handles flawless with a controller.

Still the good far outweigh the bad as Death Road To Canada brings a wonderful new, zombie style take on the Oregon Trail formula and does most of it very very well. The writing is top notch, the game has a ton of charm, the gameplay is fun, you have tough choices to make and it has good replay value.  This is a game that I find really good for an hour at a time and I can see myself playing much more over the next year. A few minor issues didn't take away from  the enjoyment I had while playing this game. Each time you restart it feels like a new experience, interested to see what new things the developers add in the future. 

Get ready for a hell of a ride with Death Road To Canada! Oh yeah, one last thing, never let a clown in you're vehicle if you see one on the side of the road!

**I got a copy of this game to review from the developers. This is the rough draft of the review, the final/edited version will be up on the website sometime this week or next week**"

												Haven't yet gotten to Canada but have had loads of fun every new game. I love making my own characters so it feels like I'm actually surviving the apocolypse with my friends. The controls are a little hard to get used to and there isn't a controls page that I've found but they are simple enough to get on your own. Also they are a little awkard since I am used to WASD and moving my character with the other hand. I don't know how to use the local co op so if someone could help me out on that I would really appreciate it."

												Saw some gaming YouTube channels I regularly watch play it, thought it was cool (especially since I'm fond of roguelikes), and added it to my wishlist on Steam and kind of forgot about it. 

Cue Autumn sale. Decided to buy it. Let it sit in my library for about a week or so before deciding to play.

All I can say is this: WOW.

Right from the start, it's pretty damn good. Nothing says ""awesome"" like slashing through zombies while going north (Though a zombie apocalypse seems more like an average day in Florida anyways). Sure, I haven't had too many runs so far, but they were surprisingly kind of intense. Every death sucks, especially in the times where I've gotten so far, but that's roguelikes for you, and that's why I love them.

Also, I'm Alexandra the resilient martial artist with a kitchen knife. Can't beat that."

												This is it, I'll make it to Canada this time!

*Starts game*

""There aren't any items! I can't feed this group of 3!""

*2/5 of the way through the game*

""Wow! The start was not so good but it's just getting better! It's almost as if the game is working with me!""

*3/5 of the way through the game*

""I can't believe it! I have a team of four and tons of supplies! This should last me the entire Death Road!""

*4/5 of the way through the game*

""The final siege? I got this!""

""NO! MY PARTY! WHY DID YOU ALL HAVE TO DIE!"" 

""I... I survived the final siege! The trip to Canada lives on! 

I-I wonder what's next?""

*pretty much 5/5 of the way through the game*

""Wait. This is the final fight? All I have to do is avoid the hundreds of zombies, cross the bridge that leads to Canada and then get the to checkpoint tower that is the safe guard!

I can do this, I know I can do this...""

*Has to calm himself down for 5 minutes before he starts*

""Here we go!""

*Starts the final battle*

*Starts dodging all of the zombies*

*Hope in his eyes*

""I... I CAN SEE THE SNOW!""

*Giant 4 zombie thick wall blocks the path while zombies are chasing from behind*

""I'm going to run through it! This is the final stand! It definitely wouldn't be smarter to shoot them with my shotgun!""

*Runs at zombies attempting to run through them*

*Dies instantly*

*Cries himself to sleep that night*

Play the game already so you can experience something equally as painful. I also recommend you nominate this game for one of the best game awards."

												Lots of games have made me lose faith that developers even care about what they put into their games anymore. 
Death Road to Canada restores that faith in me.

If I were to sum up this entire game in two scenes that happened in this game, it would be these two.

A dog named Hershel told some guy with a shotgun to ""Cool It!,"" and then proceeeded to fart in this guy's face. This causes the guy to have an emotional breakdown, question what he's been doing with his life, and through some line of thinking, gives the dog his prized autoshotgun.

The same dog, Hershel, told a band of bandits to ""Cool It!,"" and the bandits completely forgot they were robbing the rest of my team, and just brutally murdered Hershel.

10/10
Made me feel more emotions than most games these days."

												Begin my adventure traveling to Canada when I came upon a Man breaking pots with a massive sword and shouting out gibberish, who would of knew that we would become BFF. Met up with a Woman who charmed everyone, even herself. We became the ultimate zombie killing squad (there was also someone else but all she did was running around wasting my ammo on chairs), we finally got to Canada and that alone caused L*nk to speak english for the very first time.

10/10 would go on a road trip to Canada again."

												Ton'o'fun, really dig this game. 

It's a unique setup. It's sort of like Oregon / Organ Trail mixed with a lot of map encounters where you and your dudes (up to 2 local players, 4 in your team) have to avoid getting eaten by zombies when hunting for supplies. 

There is a good dose of randomness and it's hard and its fun.  There are a ton of positives and not that many negatives and it's a fair price.  And the dev seems to be from the 'update tons of ****' all the time' camp, which is a great reason to support the game. 

No reservations about recommending it. You'll know from a gameplay video if it is for you or not, I think it's great myself."

												This game is so entertaining, I've always wanted a game like The Oregon Trail, but with a different premise; And DR2C is just that game.
The charm that the game holds, and humorous events only adds to the fun when playing and managing a rag-tag team of survivors (It's better if you make characters of your friends and family, it really adds to the experience).
The only complaints I have are just small ones, like the game being really f**king hard, (But that's probably a problem with me, more than the game) and might benefit from an easier mode right from the get-go.

 All in all,  I give it a 9.2 out of 10"

												I highly recommend the game. The gameplay itself is fairly simplistic and reminiscient of FTL. However, what lifts Death Road to Canada above and beyond are its amazing writing and insane sense of humor, which both immediatelly clicked with me and made it the most fun game this year. Totally recommend it, even if you'll have maaaany attempts ahead of you before making it to Canada (or maybe because of it!)."

												This game has everything,

Lunk will practice his spin attack in the car if he's unhappy....and kill your team.
A goofy clown will transport you to a haunted clown-of-the-dead cabin for a night of terror.
Dogs can be thrown into science machines to become dog-men....that will waste all of you ammo.
Elvis will threaten the light a bridge on fire and trap a group of people unless they back down...and then he burns it down anyway!
The freest man in the world roams on foot at inscredible speed wearing nothing but a horse mask.

I can go on and on, but just go see for yourself!  The rare character mode alone is enough for a great game, but when you get creative and add your own characters based on friends/family/popular celebs (I like making a Doc Brown and Rick Sanchez party of custom characters to start a trip), and then if they see me with a dog on the side of the raod you better believe it's going to be an amazing adventure."

												This game will f&$% you up. You need to have the holy power of the RNG to survive. Now, that does not make this a bad game, it makes it realistic, for a zombie apocalypse anyways. I started off with two people. All was going well, then we met another guy, and we let him join. Then, a seige happened. A seige is where you have to hold out long enough before escaping, which can last a while. My original partner died. Blah Blah Blah anime katanas, blah blah blah Prius, and we find a girl, and let her join. Blah Blah Blah Raiders, Blah Blah Blah Supermarket, another seige. Now this time, there's two other people trapped in here with us, a police officer, and what looked like a scientist. My guy was the only survivor, after we all got cornered, and I was the only person who tried to run through the zombies, instead of fighting them. So I drive for a while longer, nobody else shows, supplies are running low, and I find this car, which looks like it has supplies. Aaaaaand the keys are missing. I walk around the surrounding area ducking and weaving, trying to find the keys, and then I find this log cabin, which is overrun with ZED, I try to run inside, but get pinned in a corner, like those I had left behind, and I died fighting. So yeah, amazing brand new game, go play it now."

												I beat the game twice one time on regular and Familiar Characters Mode out of the 25 run. Very funny on the thing you pick can save your butt most of the time. Alway keep up morale or your character start to leave by steal your supplies. Game is good but the game make it you have to have all slot fill or a S*** load of zombies are gonna f*** you up like you run out of breath be all red and can't swing your weapons. Best tip when you rob, rob people that are trading for food or gas. Never rob the weapon master cause  most of the time they will kill you or your hold group takes 2 damage.

Over all this game end really fast depends on your character and their ability to stay calm or be stronger with melee weapon or start with better weapon. Can customize your own characters. Wish i had more place to explore to get more supplies cause only one or two house fill with junk just makes it harder to beat the game. I give it a 4 out of 5.

P.s NEVER ADD JASON TO YOUR TEAM....."

												This game is very enjoyable for those who like to play hack and slash and like to make choices that can be very severe to your team's survival. Some of the deaths during these ""car events"" can be very silly but yet really stupid. The AI in this game is very well tbh imo. Descision making is sometimes hard and having to select the right choice (because yolo) for a situation is very satisfying. I can tell you that Rocketcat Games developers are very active and supportive and will always try to update the game! I bought two of their games on my iphone and they really good! This game is also coming to ios so if you want to having a bigger discount on this game, wait around one month to buy this game on your phone. I think its around 7 dollars. or u can just wait for the steam sale for this game if u want ^.^

i highly recommend this game if you are in to the Telltales, ""walking dead"" kind of games and if you like the ""castle crashers"" hack and slash kind of gameplay!

also every character you play with or make in the game has different traits and personalities and every new game has a random generated events and maps, so that makes the replay value increase!"

												First run of the game.

be playing as character Nanc, and her buddy who is a doctor guy.
shortly after setting out, a bee flies into the window of the car and won't leave.
doctor guy tries to kill it, dies instantly from bee sting.
spend most of the early journey alone, until Nanc meets a fisherman guy who only speaks in fishes.
later meet a doctor girl, and a big tough guy. go on lots of daring adventures and close calls with the three of them.
one day we are robbed by bandits, and big guy intimidates them by saying he'll burn down their bridge. they let us go and he burns down their bridge anyway.
later things start going bad, and doctor girl gets peeved. so she bullies big guy out of our group. sad times ahead.
car is out of gas and we trying to get a new one. find one but have to get keys from nearby cabin. very full of zombies.
too many zombies even with guns, and they overwhelm us. Nanc runs to grab keys and then runs for the car, but fisherman is left behind.
see him being devoured as me and doctor lady drive away. his corpse distracted the zombies enough for us to escape.
mean doctor lady starts bullying me, and causing problems. she has a meltdown and runs off.
Nanc is all alone again, with only a little gas and some ammo. but only 4 days to Canada now.
see two survivors need help. use what little ammo i have to help them escape giant horde.
they don't want to join. instead offer useless mechanical training.
car runs out of gas and have to walk, but there's still hope. only 2 more days until Canada.
get attacked by a cat. it doesn't do a lot of damage but makes Nanc feel bad.
Nanc performs first aid on herself. not very good at it, because doctors always did it.
Nanc kills herself attempting to heal cat wounds. game over.

												This game is amazing! Even on 'easy' it's still a great challenge and despite all the countless, horrorible deaths me and my friends and family in game went through, it was always fun to start it back up and try again. 

My only complaint(very minor though), is that when i have familar mode on, I only ever got 3 or 4 of the 8 characters i've made. Like the same few characters over and over and none of the others. 

If you still have doubts getting this game, just watch Projared play it and you'll be sold"

												You better COOL IT!
(mini-review)

Fantastic game, seriously. Music and visuals are top-notch and the game has a lot of humour and personality. It's super fun adding your own characters to it too. I also like the interactive aspect, which allows you to scavenge for supplies and control how you get them, rather than have it be completely RNG. Experienced no crashes over 7 hours, but apparently they are there for others.

It's a lovely game, and game from Rocketcat. Definitely check it out if you're up for an Organ Trail esque game...TO CANADA!

												“ONWARD TO CANADA!”Death Road to Canada (DR2C for short) is a *perma-death* roguelike survival. Your goal: Drive from Florida to Canada in 15 days. During the trip, you will loot & manage resources, train your characters, meet new people, deal with bandits, and make decisions in many other random events.

”COOL IT”Lovingly crafted in 3 years, DR2C is full of quirky jokes. On the road you will run into many other survivors. A car of up to 4 jerks. During the trip, you will argue and help each other. Whenever you run into a situation, options available to you will depend on the stats of your party members. A high strength character can fight a bear off. A charming person can sometimes get stuff for free at trader camps. There are also rare characters that have unique personalities, stats, abilities, and their own unique events. You can also make your own characters, and they will sometimes show up in the game. (there are also dogs and cats)

Buy NO anime!On the Death Road, you will occasionally find trader camps. The traders are randomized in each camp. Preserved food is used as currency. Sometimes you will even run into rare traders that will trade unique stuff. You need to make very prudent decisions on what to buy and what to sell. When you run out of gas, there is no guarantee that the next trader camp will have a gas trader.

”Is the Death Road really as bad as it sounds?”DR2C is brutally difficult and is not for the faint of heart. To survive the Death Road, you need both strategy and luck. DR2C has perma-death, and encourages you to play carefully rather than ruthlessly. The motivation to finish the game doesn’t come from the action itself. Instead, it comes from the story progression, the excitement of getting closer to the Canadian border day by day. 

tl;drHLTB
Takes ~2 hours to go through the entire Death Road
Takes much longer to beat the game because you’ll fail a lot
PROS
*PERMA-DEATH!!!*
The humor
Good depth
Lots of replayability (random events and characters, other game modes)
Very fun for local co-op
Good soundtrack (10+ tracks)
CONS
AI is sometimes buggy (Sometimes they get stuck picking up and dropping weapons) fixed
Melee becomes useless on the last day, and a high shooting stat is almost essential. A little unfair for strength characters
Your couch friend won’t be able to co-op with you if there is only 1 person in your party
It can be frustrating at times when you get unlucky"

												Most fun I've had in multiplayer for a while! Currently my only complaint is that second player loses control of their character to the computer every time you enter or exit a building. Fix that and I'd call it a perfect and fun awful experience!

That aside, some of my most fun adventures include being repeatedly kicked by moose, that time I was betrayed by a very unloyal dog and murdered in my sleep, the time my unloyal dog flipped out and attempted to rob a trader and was subsequently murdered...I could go on., but I'll save some of the random event surprises for people to experience on their own. And remember, losing is fun--if you can't agree with that statement and NEED to win, maybe this game isn't for you..."

Awesome character traits make for a random and surprisingly charming adventure down the highway, through towns and past many zombies. But, don't worry if charm and humor ain't your thing, there are plenty of melee weapons and firearms to bash and snipe zombies with, as you scavenge each randomly generated pitstop on your journey! Also, don't forget to grab a friend and play the controller supported 2 player, for extra chaos and good ol times."

Then we saw a hitchhiker in a hockey mask. Decided to give him a lift to Canada too.

Overnight the random girl disappeared. It was funny. Guy in the hockey mask shows us his machette and chainsaw and it's realy funny. She must have just run off.

Then my roommate disappered the next night without leaving a note... it grieved and it wasn't funny. Hockey mask doesn't say anything.

Shortly after, existance as i know it ceases to be, and the guy in the hockey mask continues our journey for us.

												Wow what a ride!!

Death Road to Canada is a real riot. I played local co-op with my wife and we both had a lot of fun! Very humorous Oregon Trail style game blended with some hack-n-slash action, with a bit of randomness thrown in for good measure.

Essentially, you are managing a group as they try to go from Florida to Canada. You manage supplies such as fuel, food, and different melee weapons and guns. There are choose-your-own-path events that pop up frequently. You sometimes will die VERY quickly from a random event, but its all good. The storyline is created as you go, and seems really great with each run.

Definately one of the highlights in this game is the ability to create custom characters, and save them so they pop up on future runs. I play myself, and my wife plays her in-game self. We put our friends in there. We choose their skill sets and how they look. It really makes the 'story' aspect so much more great.

Pros:
+Great blend of Oregon Trail and hack-n-slash gameplay
+Controller support makes this great to play from the couch
+The humor is spot-on and makes for really funny storylines that definately feel very unique each time you play
+The ability to create and save custom characters is awesome
+RPG-esque leveling up of skills really adds a layer of strategy

Cons:
-The music is pretty good, but is a bit 'lite' or 'wonky' for the game (this is hard to describe)
-I don't know if its just us, but the controller is a bit awkward in the menus (not during gameplay, though) - it feels like it is cutting out, but it is definately not a battery thing or connection since I checked
-You will have a few random deaths that feel cheap, but really its all fun and gave us good laughs

Definately an outstanding local co-op game. It is still fun single-player, but shines when playing with a friend. Overall, I could see us getting a lot of hours out of this one."

Over all this game end really fast depends on your character and their ability to stay calm or be stronger with melee weapon or start with better weapon. Can customize your own characters. Wish i had more place to explore to get more supplies cause only one or two house fill with junk just makes it harder to beat the game. I give it a 4 out of 5.

P.s NEVER ADD JASON TO YOUR TEAM....."

												This is a GREAT game. It is fun to play by yourself but it is better with friends. The only few problems I have with it are: there is no 4 player multiplayer, sometimes the cpu helping you will just stand there, and no online multiplayer but that is it. This game has to be one of the better games i have played in a while. The best way to play it though is to make friends then play familiar people mode. I don't have many hours on this game because I prefer playing with friend to guard your back."

												I have to say, it's like people said!
It's Organ Trail and all it's others systems. I'm getting pretty addicted to this game and wanting to get to Canada (as my character of course).

You start off as a survivor and maybe a buddy wanting to go to Canada as heard from the game is the safest place in the World and go through many places to gather supplies and loot to survive your road trip there. With the RNG system you can either get good or bad rolls. It can also depend on your character's traits and perks to which the system gives you. Usually the trait gives good and bad side effects and the perk gives you a good one. The game starts to get difficult as you progress through the game and gets pretty intense too. 

The only troubles I've been having are sieges being really difficult especially with the RNG paths it gives me, but it doesn't stop me from giving hope that I can make it to Canada! 

So far I've made it to Canada once in Rare Characters mode. L*nk (Don't sue N*ntendo) is pretty much the the best Rare Characters from at least my view since his sword upgrades  are pretty much OP.

I highly recommend this game for people who love Organ Trail and difficult games.
10/10 for me! :D"

												I may not have that many runs in yet but this game is great. My best run so far was when my buddy had dog friend as a perk and kept attracting dogs to the cause. About five days in I felt I was doing well then it happened. A seige completly devasted me killing the two humans in my party. One getting trapped in the horde and the other overcome by the grief of losing his partner charged head first shooting his shotgun as much as possible. All the while my lassy dog fighting with all its heart trying to save who ever was left. It only lasted seconds though the lassy all that remained. Making a getaway just as the horde closed in the dog was all I had left. Then my lassy decided it was time to stick those keys into the ignition and drive. The next day my lassy was mauled by a moose it was trying to help and thus ended my best run. 10/10"

												Ah yes, yet another zombie game. The brainless corpses are being featured in more and more games, to the point where there isn't much freshness left. So... does this Death Road to Canada manage to bring a new spin on the walking dead? Surprisingly, yes. 

The playstyle is nothing new and will be imediately fammiliar to every Oregon Trail (and Organ Trail) fan. You control a group of survivers on their way to Canada, where everything is better... well at least people aren't being eaten alive (and even if they are - free healthcare!) The story is not that complicated and very barebone. All you have to know is that the world is populated by zombies and that Canada is 15 driving days away. 

You start out with two survivers, which you can freely customize. There is quite a lot of different options and everybody can make something to suit their needs. If you're feeling up to it, you can also try rare character mode, where most of the companions you encounter are replaced with people with all sort of special abilities. I'm 8 hours into the game and I'm still often running into new companions, so there is quite a decent variety there. Once you've selected the options you like, you can hit start and be off on your journey.

Every character has different attributes, which aren't visible imediately. Instead, you discover them over time by performing different tasks that require that perticular skill. Another thing you have to keep track of are supplies. You have to gather food, fuel, meds and three types of ammo. If you run out of any of the first two, you're basicly screwed since morale also plays a big part in the game.

There are two parts to the game. The first one is presented by different encounters, where you get to pick what you want to do in a specific situation. Attributes play a huge rule here, as they can be the difference between loosing half of your supplies and beating the bandits in a flexing competition. There are quite a lot of different random events and while you can evade sometimes prevent the negative outcome, this isn't always the case. This means you can sometimes loose a big hunk of supplies (expecialy if you run out of fuel) and even members of the group, which can get quite annoying. Sure, a bit of randomness is welcome, however to much of it can make you feel salty when everything goes to hell.

The second part of the game consists of exploring of areas, populated by zombies. These include different types of missions, such as sieges and scavenging missions, to name a few. They get harder and harder over time and the same holds for the number of zombies, which can sometimes reach over 100 corpses at a time. This means that sometimes it's better to avoid them instead of trying to kill them, since they just keep on coming. Fortunately, there is quite a lot of different weapons and this does help to keep things interesting. 

From the graphics standpoint, the game looks decent but nothing special. The pixelated graphics do help it run smoothly even on older systems and integrated graphic cards, which is a big plus if your computer is a bit outdated. 
Another thing I'd point out is the soundtrack. Some of the reviewers stated that they got annoyed by it after a couple of hours, but I'm still loving it - It just fits so well. 

Conclusion:
Initialy, I've had a bit of a hard time deciding wheather I should recommend Death Road to Canada or not. Mostly because it isn't that cheap (you could argue 15$ is cheap) and there is a lot of randomness that can often screw you over. In the end however, I've decided to put my recommendation on it. I've had quite a lot of fun playing and every run I made seemed unique. While I still haven't managed to finish the game on normal mode, I've still had my share of fun. You know what they say - Sometimes the journey is more important than the destination. 

Final Rating: 7.8/10"

												Wow... now this is an interesting game. Basically Oregon Trails with zombies and a healthy (And heavy) dose of humor that suddenly pops up in the strangest places. Just to give you an example of this seriously hard but enjoyable game, I'll just mention my best run yet. 
Start off with two of my own characters, quickly recruited two more, and raided multiple places including buttville's police department. 
Then a rather hard siege came. I lost one; an annoying woman who was always tlaking about getting swole who bore copper goggles and a pink mohawk. But she died. Then, we went and found some traders- it was actually just a talking, standing dog selling ammunition, very casually. After him, we went and raided a collapsed Y'all mart... and we lost two of our people in a vain attempt to loot sugar cakes and cans of nodescript meat. 
And eventually, after crashing a car over a fissure in the ground and stealing an exterminator's van (Complete with giant plastic ant on the roof), I met Horse. 
Majestic, fast, valiant... and completely ♥♥♥♥ing insane. Basically, he was a completely naked man who would just neigh, wore a horse mask, and ran twice as fast as other characters. And low and behold, he would become the hero of this story. 
The last remaining survivor of my original group eventually diedin yet another siege, and for a long time, Horse marched on alone; charing through salvagable areas without even killing a single zombie because he could not swing a weapon. (For those are not arms, but his ""Forelegs""!) But due to some loophole the devs missed, he could shoot a gun and he became wonderous with that shotgun of his. 
Soon, I went and rescued a big fluffy white dog that took to Horse, and for nearly five days it was those two, riding on in several more cars (One which Horse managed to fix), having highly intelligent conversations between their barks and neighs. 
Eventually, the dog died in a sewer, trying to protect her equine partner. The dog and the horse- a partnership that wasn't destined to last! But Horse eventually found another companion, a bright purple haired woman with a big pistol that did much of the talking for those last few days. 
And then Canada, our last objective, came into view. Three sieges happened before, though... and good gods, fear those sieges. Especially when you're Horse. 
My purple-haired companion perished halfway into the first one (Her pistol was big, but not big enough). Horse survived the second without barely a scratch, running in circles for two hours in game time to avoid the zombies. 
But the final siege was twice as strong, and, two miles (I think) from his goal, Horse died as he had lived, running endlessly. 

This is a wonderful, brilliant game that holds plenty of surprises. It's a bit pricey, but it's worthwhile, trust me."

													This game is absolutely fantastic. Essentially, it is “Oregon Trail” but with zombies. The game forces you to make some very hard decisions which generally lead to table-flippingly bad outcomes. There are some other less consequential ones as well. These decisions generally are what decides if you make it to Canada or not. Shooting/Stabbing/Running skills are not what decides how good you are at the game, but some of such skills are necessary to avoid receiving too much damage. If you are looking for a survival game that is based off and challenges your finger agility, this is the wrong game for you. If you want a funny survival game that is based off and challenges your decision-making skills, this is the right game for you. 

	I just beat the standard campaign and was very thrilled with the ending. To get there, you need to be very careful when evading zombies, especially at the end of the game, but this does not take too much skill. The AI's are not as good at the art of dodging and will likely die due to getting trapped. Because of this, play as your most valuable character and treat your “buddies” as zombie bait and extra lives. Food can be sometimes scarce and is very useful for trading for supplies at the end of the game, so limit the amount of group members. I like to have two people in my group, but I will add a third if he/she/(enter gender here) has good traits. 

	P.S. : If you really like your “Otaku Katana” don't use it because it will likely break on the first day."

												I've been following Rocketcat Games for years now, since their early iOS days...
While I had been thoroughly disappointed in that they weren't making games for PC, I was thrilled when the kickstarter released for this game.

Sadly, I didn't have the funds to back it at the time, although it's great to see a kickstarter game that actually gets finished.

The game is really great. It's tough, like every rogue-like Rocketcat game.
Randomness sometimes doesn't seem too random, seems to give dull loot and dull character encounters. Especially when you modify the save files and find out what in all is actuall IN this game.

In the end, I wish there was more to the game, but I am still very satisfied with my purchase. The devs seem to be continuously adding. Highly recommend this game."

												I despise zombie games.  There are SO many zombie games these days, and tv shows for that matter, that they aren't done with any real sense of quality.  Deathroad to Canada is a completely different beast.  Yes it has zombies and for some it may be the focus of the game.  For me it's not.  I can honestly say I haven't felt this refreshed with a zombie esque type game in a very long time, the last was Zombie Estate 1 and 2 for Xbox 360 from the indie dev selection.  When I initially heard about this game I had reservations.  Only upon watching people play, like Vinesauce who ironically solidified my decision to buy this gem, did I realise this game was far better than it seems at times.  The genuine tongue and cheek humor adds flavor to moments when you are stuck in a room with 30+ zombies pining after you like some schoolgirl over her boy band crush.  As of writing this I have YET to actually beat the game.  This doesn't frustrate me or anything because each time I get close, I am sent into erratic displays of giddy laughter.  Can't tell you how many times I think I'm doing great only to lose my car, then get swarmed by a massive horde of zombies in a horrible attempt to find another vehicle.   By the end I'm left with 1 person, sometimes a bat wielding dog who happens to know how to DRIVE :P.  Needless to say I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and everyone who asked my opinion."

												This game will f&$% you up. You need to have the holy power of the RNG to survive. Now, that does not make this a bad game, it makes it realistic, for a zombie apocalypse anyways. I started off with two people. All was going well, then we met another guy, and we let him join. Then, a seige happened. A seige is where you have to hold out long enough before escaping, which can last a while. My original partner died. Blah Blah Blah anime katanas, blah blah blah Prius, and we find a girl, and let her join. Blah Blah Blah Raiders, Blah Blah Blah Supermarket, another seige. Now this time, there's two other people trapped in here with us, a police officer, and what looked like a scientist. My guy was the only survivor, after we all got cornered, and I was the only person who tried to run through the zombies, instead of fighting them. So I drive for a while longer, nobody else shows, supplies are running low, and I find this car, which looks like it has supplies. Aaaaaand the keys are missing. I walk around the surrounding area ducking and weaving, trying to find the keys, and then I find this log cabin, which is overrun with ZED, I try to run inside, but get pinned in a corner, like those I had left behind, and I died fighting. So yeah, amazing brand new game, go play it now."

												Pros:
+Pick up and play or spend time customizing characters
+Overall progression as well as current playthrough progression
+Hilarious writing and theme
+Simple gameplay, graphics, and sound (you might be able to play this on a ten-year-old computer)
+Rare events add extra replay value, ensuring that you'd have to play dozens of times to see everything

Cons:
-Random difficulty even in normal will make you start over from the beginning and play again because you keep telling yourself ""this will be the one"" until you realize it's 2 in the morning on a school night (is that a con?)
-Only time I beat it was when a dog I didn't even like was good at running away

If you like roguelike-likes, Oregon Trail type games, zombies, retro graphics, humor, and making characters based on your family and friends and watching them die horribly for stupid reasons, you will like this game.
On the other hand, if you think the destination is more important than the journey, this game will frustrate you like no other. Don't expect to be able to make it to Canada every time, even if you think you're prepared for everything.

10/10 would sacrifice myself and all I love to save a stupid dog again"

												- Start game with two people.

- Gary has a mysterious past, and isn't good at much of anything, and is kind of a jerk.

- Ishan is a martial artist, and is calm under fire. He's good at everything.

- Things don't go amazing, but they're far from bad. 

- Eventually we come across a woman named Virgie, surrounded by empty bottles. We wake her up, and invite her onboard the S.S. Canada. She accepts.

- Later we come across Jocelyn, who tells us to ""GET THE HECK AWAY FROM MY DOOR"", after we nearly burgle her house. We invite her onboard. For some reason, she accepts.

- Three days pass, morale is low. Somebody needs to get kicked off the team.

- I look around at my real-life friends. It's a unanimous decision.

- Later, Gary.

- Two days later, Ishan can't take the stress anymore, and wanders off into the bush, never to be seen again.

- Later that day, Jocelyn dies when Virgie leaves her in a room full of zombies, closing the door.

- The optimistic Virgie, now rid of the pessimistic Jocelyn, must find her way out of a sewer. She's cornered by zombies, and takes out an assault rifle she found somewhere. She takes down half the horde with her... but she ultimately falls.

- - - - - - 

- New playthrough; solo, no other survivors on my team.

- Come across Gary, sleeping on a picnic table.

- Keep driving, because nobody likes Gary."

												(Disclaimer : Review key recieved from developer)

The Death Road to Canada... or as I like to call it : ""The Happiest Zombie Apocalypse in America""
Bored of those gritty zombie games where you're stuck with relentless brown and green? Tired of those endless drudges through gore and misery only to wind up going from day to day rooting out tins of cold baked beans? Sick and tired of having to scavenge hundreds of planks to make fences for your little survivor camp? Hacked off at seeing the same identikit survivors which stories which all blend into each other and just make you reach for the booze?

Fret no longer, for I present the Happiest Zombie Apocalypse in America

Death Road to Canada is possibly one of the most lighthearted zombie murder games I've run into in a long while, ostensibly taking it's inspiration from the Organ Trail, and FTL, you're put in charge of two survivors, and a car. Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to drive to Canada, or to die trying. Hint, you're going to die a fair few times before you get there, but that's all part of the learning experience. You can either take some random survivors in a default game setting, or you can create your own survivors, be they friends or people you want to see turned into zombie chow, and set off with your own choice of team, with the intent of picking up more friends along the way.

Combat is a little bit loose, but that's intended by design, you are after all, survivors, not trained soldiers, so you tend to waff your melee weapons in the general direction of whatever is closest to you, said weapons ranging from spatulas (no, no joke) right the way through to sledgehammers, hockeysticks, nailboards, and baseball bats. Then you've the proper shootybang stuff with revolvers, pistols, shotguns and so on. The stats of your survivor play a significant part in how many swings they'll get in before they become ""winded"", or in the case of firearms, just how accurate they're prone to be (shotguns you can get away with giving to anyone, other guns you'll want to be a bit more careful with).

DRtC has strong DNA, with a lot of content and a strong level of depth involved
For what could have been a fairly simple pick up and play game, there's a lot of statistical complexity under the hood, with weapons having their own ""drain"" on player stamina, weapons having their own fire rate, accuracy and spread, and vehicles having their own consumption rate, and durability. Characters too have their own personality traits and benefits, meaning that it's unlikely you'll run across two survivors that are exactly the same in a given playthrough, as a direct result, DRtC becomes a far stronger game than the Organ Trail and actually elevates itself up to the company of games like Death Skid Marks, which shares the same kind of irreverant humour and sense of fun about it.

This doesn't even touch on the fact there's pets you can bring into the team (Dogs and Cats, though as yet I've not been successful at grabbing either), there's choose your own adventure style events, though these are more simplistic than say, FTL, they are stat based in terms of the choices you get with differing chances of success, and depending on your survivors, you may get presented with different options from one playthrough to the next.

Closing thoughts
Death Road to Canada -could- have been a throwaway title, or something that would have been fun for a pick up and play but ultimately not something that would stand up to repeated scrutiny. I'm glad to report that this definitely is not the case, there's real longevity here, and there's a definite gem of a game here. One that has managed to emerge as another Kickstarter success (which is a bit of a rarity these days) and one the devs rightly should be quite happy about.

Verdict : Highly recommended, with one caveat which I'll discuss below. 

However, I do not feel that it significantly detracts from the game itself as this is a single player experience, 

it would be nice to see it resolved somewhen though.

There -is- one unanswered question which I'll update my review with as time progresses, and that concerns a KS exclusive piece of content which whilst not *vast*, is game affecting. As is normal for any review I do, I do ""due dilligence"" on all games that go through Kickstarter, and I highlight such things because in the interests of being thorough, that's my job. 

One of the reward tiers ($50) provided backers with a specific game unlock, allowing them to have the option of a kitten or puppy as a ""morale booster"" who would grow into a full team member over time, at the cost of an additional food drain. This would be something in the -longer term- I'd like to see added as purchasable DLC of some sort, as it would be nice to have the full game made ""content complete"", however, as I state above, because this game is predominantly a singleplayer experience, this isn't something that will affect players beyond their personal preference.

This element will be removed or revised as more information is made available."

												What is Death Road to Canada?
Death Road to Canada is as the developers succinctly describe it in the Steam description, a 'randomly generated road trip simulator.' The game would also be considered to be a randomly generated zombie killing machine. The aim of the game is to lead you and acquaintances you meet along the way from Florida to Canada. This is because you have heard that Canada has been spared from the zombie apocalypse. However, as they say its the journey and not the destination that is the aim of the game.

Before I Begin
I have had a great time reading many of the reviews that have been contributed to Steam. This is the perfect game for sharing individual experiences. As a result, I can see fan fiction becoming an enormous part of the game's community. Therefore, kudos for this not only goes to the community members for creating this wonderful content but also to the developers for designing a game perfect and worthy of it. It is truly a testimony to the quality of the final product.

Learn As You Go
The tutorial teaches you the bare minimum. For some this may be a concern but it shouldn't be. I have found that some of the best games only teach the basic mechanics needed to play. The rest is left to the player experience. If you put the time into the game you will continue to learn each time you play. This is a very good thing. This is because some of the tricks I have learned wouldn't have meant as much had they been in the tutorial and had I not learned them by myself. Some of the magic of the playing is in the learning. Therefore, the game demands that you learn more as you progress. Consequently, you may die a few times but you need to mark these down as learning experiences.

Challenging...
To continue with the 'learning as you go' mantra of the game it must be acknowledged that it is very challenging. For starters, the zombie AI - as stupid as zombies may seem - can be quite tough. They can swarm and they can, and will, overwhelm you. Therefore you must remain alert and vigilant at all times. You must consider if you are outnumbered and if so what your best avenue of self defense and preservation is.

Weapons can and do break. You will run out of ammunition. However, you can hold multiple weapons at any one time. It is best policy to remember the strengths and weaknesses of your characters. This is most noteworthy because the weapons that you choose to wield - when you find them - can make the game easier. There's nothing better than having the ability to go to town against a swarm and defeating them all.

If there is one potential weakness of the game its in the fact that the difficulty can spike unpredictably. However, there is a valid argument that this adds realism to the game. There is never going to be any scenario that is exactly as it seems. Swarms can occur at random intervals. As a result of this randomness some of these spikes can lead to frustrating deaths.

... To the point of being Unforgiving
Generally, the game is unforgiving. Once you screw up there is very little chance for your survival. As a result of this the game is definitely one that has the potential to induce rage. An example of this rage came in my second unsuccessful attempt. I had successfully cleared a building and wanted to move on with the game. Therefore, I raced outside with my trio of seemingly hardened warriors into a swarm of the undead. I jumped in my car but of course I couldn't drive away because the vehicle was swarmed. They not only damaged the vehicle but proceeded to annihilate all of us. I could do nothing but watch in sheer terror.

Randomly Generated Adventuring
One of the best features of the game is the way in which it is randomly generated. Stories and settings for individual segments of the game are randomly generated. However, they are based somewhat from the options you are provided with.

In one of my segments I visited a city and was given the choice of whether or not I wanted to visit a sports store or a house with a HELP sign. As this was early on in the game and I was only with my initial buddy I chose to go to the HELP house. I took my chances that the house would have somebody still alive that would be willing to join my team. Although I bet the sports store probably had a nicer selection of weapons and equipment that I could pick up. This strategy was of the hope that the numbers game would help more than a randomized weapon. I was proven to be correct. I acquired the extra party member and was able to adventure on.

In conclusion, the events are random. This is especially relevant considering the entirety of the game is played out within these little settings. However, it leads me to the next segment of the game that is worth noting and that is the game's buddy system.

The Buddy System
This is one of my favorite features in the game. Hidden within the fun thrilled violence is a message about camraderie and the meaning of taking a road trip together. You have a choice at the beginning of the game whether or not you want to start with an ally. I would suggest that if you are a beginner that you do have one. If you have a second player with you then they can play the role. If not, then the computer will control them for you. Because the game has been well designed the AI does a reasonable job hacking enemies up for you.

Each ally comes with their own unique characteristics and skills that can add value to your team. Although beggars can rarely be choosers you may want to consider what type of characters you align yourself with. They can stay with you until they either die or they betray you. That's right, they can betray you. That in itself is a fascinating mechanic. If they do betray you then its game over. It's best to keep their morale high - through successful completion of events and stories - although I am uncertain as to whether or not this increases the likelihood of betrayal. I assume that it would.

Custom Characters
A great feature of the game is that you can create a number of custom characters. You can choose to play this character and/or have one as your buddy. If you choose not to do this then they can and will pop up throughout the game. It is at this turn that you can add them as allies.

Risk/Reward and Resource Management
There is a risk/reward system at play in the combination of stories/events and allies. Events will pop up throughout the game that provide you with an opportunity to utilize their abilities. If they are successful then you can increase your stockpile sometimes dramatically. However, failure in any of these events can see a crucial member of your unit die. As a result you will need to carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of your character, your current predicament and determine whether or not the potential reward is worth it. Given the unforgiving nature of the game each decision is significant.

With that said an underappreciated part of the game is in its resource management. Players must consider how many rations, medical supplies, fuel, etc. that they have at their disposal. Players must therefore weigh up the pros and cons of adding an ally. If you are running dangerously low on resources then adding a member to your team may not be the most sage of things to do.

As a result of the total combined randomness you are guaranteed a unique playthrough every time you play."

The car ran out of gas. 
I stubbed my toe. 
A bee flew into the car. 
Your favorite survivor steals everything and abondons the group. 
A demon possesses a survivor and demands food. 
Bandits with guns demand all your food, gas, medical supplies, and personal belongings. 
A magical genie appears then turns out to be one of those evil genies. 
Half you group dies a few days before they arrive at the boarder to Canada.

But man it feels awesome when you beat the game.

												Frustration intensifies. If only I am allowed to express my anger towards this game, i would curse the heck out of it.

Your journey to Canada will be riddled with both luck and bad events. One poor decision will make a domino effect of terrible outcomes with a slight chance of slipping it through. You can have your significant other to become your buddy in the apocalpyse but as of now, there is a flaw in terms of control upon death but rest assured that it will be addressed in the future updates."

Awesome character traits make for a random and surprisingly charming adventure down the highway, through towns and past many zombies. But, don't worry if charm and humor ain't your thing, there are plenty of melee weapons and firearms to bash and snipe zombies with, as you scavenge each randomly generated pitstop on your journey! Also, don't forget to grab a friend and play the controller supported 2 player, for extra chaos and good ol times."

												Create Cesar Milan as a playable character, giving him friend of dog and charming. Playing in Familiar Faces Mode. Recruit Cesar Milan the dogwhisperer, and he's a swell guy, frequently boosting group morale and talking his way out of situations. We don't encounter any dogs after recruiting him. Then, things get messy during an escape and he gets grabbed by a hoarde as the car pulls away... The very next day we find a pet shop filled with non-hostile feral dogs and their treasure trove of bones. 

Could have had a squad of dogs trained by Cesar Milan, instead there was just tragedy and woe.

												Skill has little or nothing to do with completing this game.  Don't get me wrong, you use skill to play the game.  It's quite fun.  But you can get right up to the end, and on the hour of your triumph the game will simply say ""GAME OVER"" in the most abrupt and unpleasant of manners without even a random chance of your success.  You can be at the top of the stats game, tons of supplies, 1 day from the end, and a dialog appears with a single button ""OK"" and says ""Someone forgot to turn the car engine off when the team went to sleep and the entire team has died from carbon monoxide poisoning.""  Is that even legal?  I've left this game feeling like I've been abused.  Like my rights have been violated on some fundamental level.

Still, I would buy it again.  Is this what Stockholm syndrome feel like?"

												I started out with just a couple of randos, eventually met an Elvis impersonator who was so good at karate he didn't need weapons, then met myself and found out I was an enormous jackass. Along the road we  had to deal with loads of bandits, got really beefy, and charmed a dog into giving us free bullets. Unfortunately we all died at the Canadian border shortly after kicking the first member of the team out for being a grade-A dink.

Rocketcat's made another great game, and finally one that you can play on something other than a phone."

												Everything happened so quickly. Me and my group fell dead in an instant, and it was all my fault. 

     It started with just me and my brother. We were driving along, with about as much supplies as one would want at the start of their journey. Enough to instill hope for the long and arduous journey ahead. That is until I committed the most horrid Iniquity known to the modern man. 

     I farted

     I looked to my brother and I saw hatred in his eyes. In a panic I did what any strong man within a life or death situation would do. I blamed the other. Reluctantly, my brother accepted it without argument. We both knew I was the culprit, but we were close enough that such a large fault could be overlooked. However, it did put a deal of strain on our relationship. 

     We traveled further, fighting against the zombie horde. Until I came across my girlfriend, trying in vain to push open a door clearly labeled ""pull"". Me and my brother's morale had been beaten down, we were in dire need of an ally to help push back against the coming darkness. For a moment I contemplated leaving her behind. Her low level of intelligence could prove to be our downfall But, I glanced down to the small stuffed penguin she had given me as a gift. I still kept it around, she always knew I was fond of penguins and risked her life to scavenge one after all the shops had been raided. It seemed strange that people would leave behind such a valuable item in a zombie infested wasteland. It seemed to beg me to take her with us. So we welcomed her to the group and continued on our way to Canada. 

     Days went by with much success. With her help we had been able to scrounge up enough resources to last us a while. Everything seemed to be looking for us. That was of course, until yet again someone broke wind. For a brief moment we all eyed each other. The friendship and loyalty I once saw gave way to anger and suspicion. Not once, but twice someone had broken the sacred oath to keep that which was meant for the bathroom, in the bathroom. I was not responsible this time, but that would not stop the group from blaming me. Pinning the blame on another would not work this time. Then, a glimmer of hope appeared, I could have my girlfriend attempt to ""deduce"" who had farted. I never thought she was particularly stupid, but if I was correct, I could line up the ""evidence"" to ensure the blame did not fall on me. I could avoid becoming more broken without sacrificing what precious little relationships I had left. I did as planned, and my girlfriend figured out who farted.

     Me.

     Then I saw something in her eyes. Glee. SHE had been the one who farted. It was HER fault. But I could not argue with her. I had underestimated her, I fell for her trap, and had allowed her to avoid the blame without risk, However, my brother was convinced and the matter was settled. Had she feigned idiocy this entire time? How much of her word could I trust now that I knew she was so willing to blame others for her own farts? I looked down to my sentimental stuffed penguin. How could I trust that this penguin was even a quality store product? It must have been shameful replica designed for the sole purpose of earning my trust. Yes, I could see it now. The eyes were slightly discolored and the head was tilted at an angle. It was a lie.

     How long had she been maintaining this facade? Was my brother deceiving me as well? I would not let this stand. I planned to escape the hordes of zombies with the supplies and leave the others to suffer. One could blame another for one's farts, but if one gives another a stuffed penguin that is anything below store quality THAT was inexcusable. Unfortunately, in planning to escape the future horde along with abandoning my group. I inadvertently landed me into a horde that was right in front of us. You’d think a large mass of writhing undead would be hard to miss, but alas my wrath had blinded me.

     There was no mercy in that shambling wood cabin. The undead beat down the roof and walls. They broke in from every part that they could. We fought as hard as we could. My girlfriend was the first to fall, then my brother. Both became nothing more than a mass of broken flesh beneath a horde of savage creatures. Finally, as I fell to the hordes around me, as they feasted on my flesh, two simple words left my mouth before those creatures tore my body apart.

												-has no room in car-

-looks at boyfriend-

This game is full of difficult choices. 

Haven't been addicted to a zombie survival game like this since Organ Trail, and while that game is very dear to me...dare I say it, DRTC does it better. It's a beautiful little game. Lots of features and options, sky high replayability and very responsive devs who are STILL working on adding cool features and tweaking the game make this an excellent purchase. I didn't wait for it to come on sale, and feel zero regrets about it. 

In terms of difficulty it is quite punishing. But the journey is enjoyable enough that even when its infuriating, I feel compelled to dive back in. 

This is an absolute treat."

												I'm going to be straight. This review would be a 5/10, but Steam insists on black and white reviews. Death Road has a lot going for it, from the charming graphics to the character customisation, but at its core, it's deeply flawed. I love rogue like games that allow you a chance to progress through a random universe, and FTL will always be a game I run back toward, but Death Road lacks this appeal. Strip away the zombies and you'll have a game where the random event/number generator won't just steer or manipulate your adventure, but flat out cripple it with zero input. You'll often find yourself being skewered by Bandits after running out of gas, simply because the game never provided enough for you to loot. For ten bucks it's a bit of fun, but it seems to lack some solid balance behind the chibi-sprites and Final Fantasy menus. I'd prefer it if this game rewarded skill a great deal more."

												One part Zombieland, one part roguelike, and one part 2d action brawler, DRtC is the game that we all hope every zombie game will be. It is the game every zombie game promises to be. It's very specifically the game Organ Trail promised it would be.

I wish I was articulate enough to explain why this game is so good, why it's such a delight to play, and why it's so addictive. I can't, but I hope however high my hours played gets for this will serve as a testament.

Death Road To Canada is very, very good, and you should buy it."

												This game is like Oregon Trail meets Zombies Ate My Neighbors. (oh that's been said before? well, it's still true) and I think I REALLY like it.

I'll get the Cons & Pros out of the way, first.

CONS:it's perma-death.
meaning you may get attached to awesome characters only to have him or her or EVERYONE die. :D

the RNG on text encounters. Sometimes the RNG will seem unfair & that's just how it is with these games. Make a choice that has a 50/50 chance of being good or terrible. Oh no. Lookit, a character died 'cause the game told me she/he did.

""Doors and how they can kill you"" - how doors work is only 1st player (lead role) can go through doors to go to the next room. This would be fine, BUT if 2nd player isn't immediately next to you, a delay is put in before 2nd player appears at the next doorway. In theory it's good, but it quickly becomes frustrating when you realize ""Oh no. 2nd player was 2 steps behind me and now I just killed them."" :SNEUTRALSit's so good you'll almost always get that 'just one more time' feeling when & if you die.

family friendly -(could be a pro or a con) nothing inappropriate; NO cursing, excessive gore, or 'suggestive' talkPROS: (too many to list, but I'll try) 2 Player Co-Op! -drop-in/drop-out cooperative play at any time. (fun tip: 2nd Player can choose which party member to play as when dropping in on a playable encounter - ie: town, swarm event, etc.)

Cool character creator -sure, it may be retro pixelated graphic style, but there are enough customization options to generally make characters that look mostly like anyone you know.

64 character slots -save & use your own custom characters; can set as the 2 starting characters OR as possible recruits. 

different modes -3 modes are unlocked from the start. more can be unlocked as you play the game and do certain things. Each mode has different rules for which characters you will meet. (note: play familiar mode if you want your team to meet ONLY custom characters)

great soundtrack (that reminds me of music from Metropolismania [PS2 game, released 2002] for some reason)

Fun for the whole family & funny -in text narration, character dialogue, and some animations & references

references (I won't spoil) to at least a few things from your childhood and/or 90's/early 2000s era.

RNG: never knowing what characters you're going to run into

SAVE AND QUIT! - the game doesn't make this feature super obvious, BUT if you quit the game, then the current game session will be saved at the point of the last town /playable encounter. Awesome, considering each game session varies in length

H I G H Replay Value. due to random encounters, random characters, and randomly generated levels -all varied enough to keep it interesting through dozens of hours of playthroughs (probably even more)

nuances of strategy: shut doors behind you, carry up to 3 weapons, choosing roles & weapons before each playable encounter...these are all things that did NOT need to be in the game, but their inclusion gives DRtC much more strategy and depth
CLOSINGI can't put into words how great this game is. You NEED IT NOW.
Play it with family. Play it with friends.♠ It will make you laugh and maybe even feel nostalgic. Don't let the ""rogue-like"" label scare you off. It's well worth any frustrations. 



9/10 > > > Great game. Almost perfect.





-----
♠ Also, play it all by yourself :( *insert joke about morale going down*... :D

edit 1 (12-01-16): fixed formatting of lists
edit 2 (12-09-16): fixed typo on 'nuances of strategy' under PROS
edit 3 (12-10-16): added 'family friendly' under Neutrals; added '64 character slots', '2 Player Co-Op' under Pros; reworded title and description for 'Save and Quit'
e4 (12-22-16): reworded description of 'Save and Quit' to be more clear and concise
e5 (12-27-16): added con ""Doors & how they can kill you"" (might even say it hit me like a ton of zombies at a doorway)
e6 (02-20-17): changed wording on '64 character slots'; &added bullet point of 'different modes'"

												Let's be honest, zombie games are overdone. The genre is congested with stale, uninspired, boring and pointlessly challenging games that make this over saturated part of the market even more and more irrelevant.  But this game, with its goofy atmosphere, upbeat music  and charming art style, is breathing new life into this undead genre.
Death Road to Canada is an easy game to pick up, an easy one to learn, but even harder to put down. The rogue-like adventure/survival aspects make every play through of this game different and interesting. And with the custom character feature, you are given the power to generate so many more possibilities as you experiment to see who works well with whom.
Part of the reason this game is so easy to fall in love with is the culmination of its dorky sense of humor and catchy OST. For some unforeseeable reason, the chiptune music pairs perfectly with a game about blood, guts and survival. And the possibly fatal decisions you are making on the road turn from frustrating to hilarious due to the comical writing. Never before has a fart been the catalyst that led to my character's downfall, and for that reason alone this game deserves an award. 
I have but two complaints. First is that the RNG can sometimes ruin you. Often you are left with decisions while driving; do you surrender food or fight the bandits? Abandon the car or attempt to fix it? etc, etc. But at times you come to a decision where the solution involves shooting or other skills, and by some cruel twist of fate the character making this decision is the least proficient marksman. And you can't change that. This has never ruined the experience for me, mind you. With these decisions, the game is often fair. All of my failures are my own, not the game's. Save one instance, this is also my second complaint. For some reason, when the AI characters encounter a weapon they already have they get stuck in a perpetual loop of weapon switching. This doesn't happen too often, but when traveling the mall I had two characters of mine get stuck in this loop with umbrellas which resulted in their deaths. This led to a slippery slope which ended in a game over. So beware of that.
Ultimately this game is more than worth your time and money. It's fair yet challenging. It's more fun than frustrating. And it's highly addictive. Give it a chance, especially if you love other rogue games like Binding of Isaac and things of that ilk. I'd also like to recommend checking out more of Rocketcat's games. I enjoy playing their mobile games, and I look forward to see what these devs will do in the future.
TL;DR
Good game. Happy chiptune music. Dog's use crowbars. Farts can be fatal. This game is rife with references to different shows/games/etc. Cat video magazines are a thing in this game and I'm sad that they aren't real."

												I started off as a young athletic man with nothing to lose, riding solo in the zombie apocalypse or however you spell it. I looted a few stores here and there gathering food and medical supplies for my journey ahead. After gathering some supplies, a woman named Jetta wanted to join my group! I was excited and anxious to see what the future had in store for the two of us. We got along pretty well, she always told me to shut up, but I think she was just flirting. All of a sudden, our first siege came upon us! Luckily it wasn't too big of a horde and, I had gathered enough bullets for my pistol to hold off the zombies until we could escape. We made it out alive, our first siege. We had been through a lot after only being together for a day or two. I think our relationship was really beginning to blossom! We were getting closer and closer to Canada, we could taste the free health care. Then another lone survivor came across my group! His name was Drew and he claimed that he had a very skilled background in medicine! I was happy to hear that because a doctor is always a plus in the zombie apocalypse! 

Me, Drew, Jetta, fighting through grocery stores and small towns in search of more supplies to aid us in our survival. After looting some stores, we came across the greatest loot we would ever find, his name, Alessandro, the most loyal creature in the world, Alessandro the hero hound. The 4 of us continued on our journey, we were running low on medical supplies, and Jetta was very low on health, living on the edge between life and death. We stopped in a junk yard in the hopes of finding more medical supplies, and more gas. The horde here was massive, it wasn't looking good for the group. We rummaged through old broken down cars and piles of rubble, no medical supplies, but I did find a safe with a bunch of gas so that helped. I wanted to stay a little longer to see if we could find anything to heal Jetta. That was when I knew that I made a horrible mistake, we were cornered, the only way out was through a horde of 40+ zombies. Swinging our hatchets and kitchen knives we fought as hard as we could through the horde to try and get Jetta out and to safety, but...it was too late, Jetta's baseball bat snapped in the middle of the horde...One bite to the neck...Jetta went down. The zombies began ripping her to shreds, all we could do was watch. We had to get out of there before the zombies got to us too, ""BARK! BARK!"" Alessandro said as we drove off from the junkyard. A truly emotional loss for the group, but its survival of the fittest and we had to move on. 

Right after our junkyard disaster we came across a SIEGE! I was low on health and I had no ammo for my pistol. Drew had a strange looking orange knife and I thought to myself, WOW HE HAS SOME SORT OF LEGENDARY WEAPON, but no...it was just a rusty machete. The siege horde was massive, and we were stuck in a building with no rooms. Zombies came flooding in through the door, we hacked away at their rotting heads hoping to make it out alive! I was down to my last few breaths, I was exhausted from swinging my hatchet, my hits were doing no damage, I had to run into another corner to recuperate while Drew and Alessandro kept fighting. I regained my strength and dove back into the zombies, FOR ALESSANDRO!!! I yelled. Drew was slightly offended but he didn't have time to get angry, because a zombie had grabbed me by the leg right as I dove into the horde. I went down, as the zombies ate away at my insides and I let out my final screams of life, I heard Drew and Alessandro scamper out of the house, they made it out alive. 

Then there were two, Drew and Alessandro the hero hound. Their drive to their next location did not last long, they came across an impassable obstacle, they were doomed, and they knew it from the start, it was...The River of Death. Drew and Alessandro ran into the wet, dark, zombie filled maze. Alessandro sprinted ahead to find an escape route while Drew followed far behind fighting through the zombies with an old kitchen knife. Alessandro needed help fighting the zombies and was also having trouble finding an escape route, so he ran back to find Drew. They met eyes from across the hall...there was a look of shock on Drew's face, he had nowhere to run, zombies were latched on to his legs. He was dragged to the floor as almost a hundred zombies hurried to his corpse to get their long awaited meal. 

Alessandro knew he couldn't stay in this hell hole. He was low on health and didn't know if he would make it out alive, but he had to try. He ran as fast as he could dodging left and right between massive groups of zombies. He busted through 3 or 4 doors trying to find the light to the outside. He knew he was getting close, but he could hear zombies all around him, his adrenalin spiked and he began to run faster than he had ever run before. Alessandro ran through a door into a long empty hallway, he was home free! He thought he was...the hallway ran out...the splashes of water coming from hundreds of zombies filled the room at the end of the hallway. With zombies in front of him marching towards, and plenty of zombies still hungry from Drew's devouring, Alessandro had no choice. He had to hope that there was a door to the outside through this massive crowd, he went for it. The zombies grabbed at him and snatched at his weak legs hoping to bring him down just like they did to Drew. Alessandro could see the light! The doorway to freedom! The road to Canada was just in front of him waiting to be taken on for at least a bit longer! He was almost out of the horde, he could smell the air from outside, he kicked it into high gear! Sprinting for his life and hoping to avenge the others and make it to Canada! Alessandro knew he had made it past the horde, until...he felt a tug at his leg, he FLEW BACK into the horde!! Alessandro yelped and howled for his friends, but they were all gone, the dream of making it to Canada was lost. RIP Alessandro, we will never forget you,

If you have read up to this point, thank you very much, this took me forever to write. Awesome first playthrough, and I expect there will be many more to come, thanks for reading my story, also buy this game it's really fun!

12/10 would run mindlessly through giant zombie horde with no health again."

												Death road to Canada is such a fantastic game and it has so many hilarious and surprising moments. The Goal of this game is to get to Canada while driving with a bunch of jerks and trying
to keep your face from being eaten off ;) .Since this game is pretty difficult and will probably take a few tries before you get to Canada, but when you do, it is so satisfying. Probably the most satsifying thing that i have ever done (now that i think about it, that sounds really sad). Overall its a really fun game and had some good laughs. Highly recommend getting this game. :)

Pros:
-Fun gameplay
-Different modes to keep things intresting
-As tough as old boots
-Great music
-The pixel art style is amazing (love all the small details)
-Lots of trial and error
-pretty good character customisation

Cons:
-Sometimes it can be a bit unfair

10/10 would play this again
and again
and again
:P"

												Started off with Genji and Tasha things were going smooth on our quest to Canada and along the way to Canada we met Billy. He was a fisherman with immense shooting skills but with a kind heart. He gave us some catfish when we were running low on food and helped us on our seige when we were sandwiched by zombies. Unfortunately the bandits came and   Billy sacrificed himself for us to move on. Next we stumble upon Ninja and took her in our team. Things were not doing well as our morale decreased and Tasha being the b*** that she is, wanted to boot Genji out of the team. Genji leaves and we went on and eventually  Tasha went through a votex and became Ahsat met Artsy on the way. Upon recruiting Artsy, Ninja just threw a smoke bomb and basically ditched the team. Things were going solid as a two man team and eventually we met Gnomey. Gnomey had a short time with us since he protected us from the bandits that tried to steal our food and supplies. We went onward and we met Snoop Dog. He was a nice guy sang songs for us and boosted the morale. We went to raid a supermarket packed with zombies and Snoop Dog being the gangster that he is shooted the zombies like theres no tomorrow. Unfortunately Snoop Dog got caught by the zombie horde and became food for the zombies. With just a few days away from Canada the team happened to stumble upon Ramboux. We paid 10 food to him to be in our team unfortunately he died right after we got him since he was unable to ride the car. As our journey to Canada almost comes to end we were getting worried that we do not have enough man power to do the last fight to Canada. Fortunate enough we saw Fatty Tuna the nerd and got him along with some medical supplies. Along the way we saw a HELP banner and paved our way through the zombies to recruit the last man in our team which was Kelp. We went on a seige for 4 hours and went through the Canadian boarder, fended off the last set of zombies and eventually we got into Canada with the Prime minister welcoming our team with open arms."

												Awesome rogue survival game!
If you like these games, like FTL, Binding of Isaac, Dungeon of the endless ect. then this game will entertain your tortured soul.

Random Events, Zombies, Survival, Zombiegore, Pixelshit and crazy folks (you can even make your own characters to play and even show up during your journey).
The more you play it, the more stuff you'll unlock, also you level up skills/traits and the progress of these will never be lost.

Saw this on Greenlight years ago and was waiting for the release and i am not disappointed.


Only minor complain: No steam-achievements, but meh, FTL doesn't have em' aswell and it's still awesome."

												I loved Darkest Dungeon, the idea of sending a party of your friends into random situations is a great one. Death Road to Canada uses a similar system, however instead of walking through dungeons you are adventuring on to Canada. On your way to Canada you will experience a vast number of different events. These events can range from meeting travellers that end up joining your party to encountering bandit, bodybuilding enthusiasts. These events are the foundation for the game and offer plenty of re-playability to the game itself. 

Exploration
Moving on from the in-game events, lets address one of the negatives I have with the game, exploration. Each building you venture into is extremely lacking in the creativity department. Most buildings will be filled with gas, food and weapons. The problem is to find all of them, you will want to search every room, this creates very boring scenarios of you and your friend searching through empty rooms which are literally empty. They could have atleast added some furniture to make them feel more authentic, but instead if you enter a room with nothing but a bunch of garbage blocking off a door. You instantly know to turn around because it will be one of the MANY empty and pointless rooms in this game. Just to clarify my criticism here Is that the rooms are completely baron of ANYTHING, they didn’t have to contain usable items, but I would have liked to see these rooms contain some sort of personality or baring. Not only did this make exploration, long and arduous but it really encouraged players to skip exploring entirely If they already had enough supplies to last them a while. 

Visuals/Graphics
And now is the part of every review where I talk graphics. Now this game has that same pixelated art style we have all become VERY familiar with over the years. It seems that after one game tried using this retro look EVERY possible indie promotion started using it for reasons I can’t recognise. Luckily here it fits decently, as the world created around your survivors is wacky enough to fit the strange 80’s style visuals. 

Performance
No surprise here with its low CPU and GPU intensive graphics, the game runs fineand they offer you some nice, complementary options; fliters for the screen if you want to go full 80's mode, stylistic screen tearing toggle options and fully rebindable keys. I should also mention that all actions in the game can be changed on controller as well as the keyboard, when you are playing co-op with a friend I found that this was a nifty addition to controller users.

Music
As for the music, it’s quite strange. Normally in a zombie game where you’re fighting for survival you wouldn’t have fun up-beat music sounding off in the background. But much like the visuals it works well with the cheesy game the developers are creating. It took me a while to get used to it but after I did, I can’t imagine going back to the solemn soundtracks of past zombie games. 

Combat
Combat feels decent enough, it doesn’t take away anything from the game but it felt too basic to warrant praise of any kind. In combat you can use guns, melee weapons and explosives. Melee weapons use up your character’s stamina, your character’s stamina is measured in the traits your character has unlocked. Obviously more physically athletic survivors will be able to use their melee weapon for longer without getting tired. The gun play is fine, the game automatically locks on to zombies you are facing which works well enough. I am slightly dissapointed as it felt like the developers were catering a little too much to the controller users rather than the much more plentiful keyboard and mouse users, thsi is ecspecially the case with the gun play, it felt like their main goal was to dumb it down completely so that controller users wouldn't be left behind by the vastly superior PC controls. But in saying that, it's not necessarily a bad system of combat, I just feel like it takes away the benefit of using a keyboard and mouse to a slight degree, and let me highlight the word slight, this is a MINOR nitpick. 

Conclusion
Overall Death Road to Canada is a fun game to play with your friends, you can laugh at the random events that occur and dance to the funky music playing in the background while killing zombies constantly. However, without friends this game is quite bland, exploration is quite a linear experience and on your own the combat feels dreadfully average."

												9/10
Most entertaining rouge like game I've ever played.
Funny and rewarding. Coop is ok, just some levels aren't meant for it, but overall it's a perfect couch game. The game feels complete but the release doesn't quite fit. I don't see why this doesn't have achievements or cards. Character creation could use some more options and there could be more skills/skill levels, but that all really can only subtract 1 point. At worst, it's 8 out of 10 for the music being too loud and repetitive. Still, this game is a must have if you are into a challenge or rouge likes or zombies or coop."

												Incredibly funny.
Incredibly challenging.
Incredibly well done.
A very in-depth zombie survival game with LOTS of content and never the same experience twice.
One of the best rogue-likes I think on Steam right now.
Everyone should honestly give this game a shot. 

I've been a fan of this developer for years since they released Punch Quest (which this game heavily references with its humour). This game has been in the works for years, and it really really shows. I think the icing on the cake is being able to make your own characters, NPC's, and go on an adventure with all of them to escape the zombie hoards. 

*UPDATE FROM ORIGINAL*
The updates to this game have been INCREDIBLE and they keep getting better. This game just continues to constantly improve and blow me away with what they're doing with it. Easily one of my favorite purchases on Steam and always a fun game to come back to."

												I've come to like Death Road to Canada, its a neat little indie title that has had some thought put into it.  Its a nice twist on an old concept, I'd honestly say that it plays similar to faster than light, only instead of aliens you have to fight zombies. Death Road requires inventory and resource management, some on the fly environmental awareness and deciding whether or not you have the resources to recruit additional members to your group of happy, hopeful survivors. Speaking of recruitable members, you can come across a wide variety of survivors, ranging from your run of the mill pistol and crowbar toting survivor, to a Jason Vorhees lookalike and a magical anime girl, you can even recruit the occasional dog into your group. The game also has quite a few random encounters which can put your group members skills to the test. you may have to pass charisma or strenght checks or perhaps a more in depth shooting or medical skill check. The game has a quirky sense of humor that isn't for everyone, personally I find some of the jokes a little hit and miss. The game is a little pricey for what it is, with other indie titles of a similar style going for much less, would recommend waiting until Christmas or Summer when this will probably go on sale.

Positives 
>Wide variety of weapons to choose from
>Suprisingly good character customisation 
>Wide range of skills for your character 
>A decent assortment of vehicles to find and use in your trek to Canada 
>The randomly generated style of play can provide a decent challenge 
>The humor is pretty good in places 
>Soundtrack included in the game's files 
>A pixel art style that has had some effort put into it 

Negatives 

>For those who have grown tired of pixel art, this may not be for you
>RNG can make the game punishingly difficult 
>Sometimes the game provides you with little supplies on the early stages, amplifying the difficulty later on
>Zombie encounters are sometimes too few and far between, sometimes they occur too often
>Priced a little high for what is essentially a rather basic game (Honestly, Hotline Miami cost less than this)

Finally, I'll go on record by saying that this is perhaps the only game i've played so far where a character can be killed by stubbing their toe on a rock."

												- Start game with two people.

- Gary has a mysterious past, and isn't good at much of anything, and is kind of a jerk.

- Ishan is a martial artist, and is calm under fire. He's good at everything.

- Things don't go amazing, but they're far from bad. 

- Eventually we come across a woman named Virgie, surrounded by empty bottles. We wake her up, and invite her onboard the S.S. Canada. She accepts.

- Later we come across Jocelyn, who tells us to ""GET THE HECK AWAY FROM MY DOOR"", after we nearly burgle her house. We invite her onboard. For some reason, she accepts.

- Three days pass, morale is low. Somebody needs to get kicked off the team.

- I look around at my real-life friends. It's a unanimous decision.

- Later, Gary.

- Two days later, Ishan can't take the stress anymore, and wanders off into the bush, never to be seen again.

- Later that day, Jocelyn dies when Virgie leaves her in a room full of zombies, closing the door.

- The optimistic Virgie, now rid of the pessimistic Jocelyn, must find her way out of a sewer. She's cornered by zombies, and takes out an assault rifle she found somewhere. She takes down half the horde with her... but she ultimately falls.

- - - - - - 

- New playthrough; solo, no other survivors on my team.

- Come across Gary, sleeping on a picnic table.

- Keep driving, because nobody likes Gary."

Fricking AMAZING soundtrack
A Pixel Art style that is actually cool to look at

												I absolutely loved this game and I keep coming back for more!

Pros:
-Great happy soundtrack to sets the atmsophere and makes it feel like a fun road trip!
-Cute jokes and humor all over the place
-Inventive traits and perks
-Dogs as playable characters!!!
-Simple gameplay at first glance, but can be mastered to get better at the game

Cons:
-Wrong combinations of characters can be really penalizing.
-Sometimes the RNG can really be harsh
-Random events can really screw up your team and things can get worse real quick
-AI can sometimes act strangely (using guns when I ask to use melee) or get stuck


Get this game if you like:
-Rogue-likes
-A zombie game with a happy atmosphere
-Binding of Isaac
-Feeling empowered when you little gang of allies kill zombies with you
-...or dodging zombies and gathering resources"

Days pass and she's the only one left standing.
Her disfigurement was the result of her being more and more anime everyday.

												Death Road to Canada is a game about controlling a car full of jerks as they ♥♥♥♥ up literally everything from Florida to Canada.

If you're a fan of games that are unforgiving at the slightest mistake, you should get this. If you lose your car, you lose the game.

Pro Tip: Make custom characters that you'll be comfortable with. There'll be situations where you can talk your way out, or you'll have to fight your way out of.

Pro Tip 2: There's no shame in asking for help or going to the wiki. I know I said it before, but this game is UNFORGIVING."

												Started the game off by creating my family (dad,mum,brother,nan,uncle and ME!!!!)
Turns out im not good at surviving and i was swiftly killed while trying to work out how the game worked.
My brother was still left though so i went on an adventure!
......And was then pinned down in a ""survive the horde"" sort of game.
Then i found my golf loving dad at a driving range wielding a golf club. 
Things were looking up!
I even replaced a persons head with a pugs head...... because you can do that in this game so why not XD
Then eventually all of the group died when they were left carless and were attempting to get another one.

In summary:
THIS GAME IS AWESOME!"

												You huddle in your boarded up apartment, surrounded by zombies.  You ran out of food a week ago.  Your last friend died three days ago.  You ran out of bullets yesterday, but you saved one for yourself.  As the zombies tear down the door to your room, you put your pistol to your head and close your eyes.

You hear a familiar jingle in the distance, getting closer.  You open your eyes.  Suddenly one of the walls explodes inwards and a huge vehicle plows through, sending severed limbs and zombie entrails everywhere.  It’s an ice cream truck!  The driver has a green mohawk, and a rusty machete across her lap.  In the back you hear two people arguing about which one of them farted.  The driver throws the door open.

“Get in loser.  We’re going to Canada!”"

												My actual hours in this game are probably closer to sixty. It's a great time killer, but don't expect to go in thinking you have a chance. Your success will largely depend on luck.

Simply put, this game reminds me a of cross between Organ Trail and Dead Pixels. A nice little gem of a game that's loads of fun especially when you make all the characters as people you know... their deaths really impact you.

While their are some cheap moments in the game and occasional bad random roles for the most part the game seems pretty fair and balanced.

												This is based off of a true story.

Everything was fine. Kiara, Rosaline, and their dog, Billy, were cruising down the Death Road to Canada. They had over 200 gas, over 30 food, 20 medical kits, and more ammo and weapons than they know what to do with. They were a happy family, eating marshmallows and telling scary stories around the fire.
Then... everything changed when the group of bandits attacked.
Kiara was killed. But that wasn't the worst part. The dog was killed. Sweet little Billy. Struck down in his prime. Rosaline was all alone.
So she traveled on. The car broke down. She walked alone, through the rain. She didn't have time to mourn the lost of her dearest friends... her only friends. Then, when all hope was gone, while looting an apartment, Rosaline found a dog, Jeanette. She adopted Jeanette and they traveled onwards.
The two comrades happened upon a junkyard that had a decent car. At the junkyard was another dog that joined them in their new car. Jeanin was one of them now. Their family was growing. They were all smiles and laughs. Jeanette loved to stick her fluffy doggy head out the window.
And another dog, Virginia, found them on the road and joined them! Rosalin was surrounded by sweet, loving, zombie-killing dogs. What more could she ask for?
But one apartment... there were too many zombies. Rosalin was seperated from her beloved dog. She slashed at the rotting zombies with her rusty machete but she was too tired. Her arms went limp at her side as she felt teeth rip into her flesh. She looked at Jeanette one last time... her last breath was a single, whispering word:
""Canada.""
The fluffy little dog gathered up her friends, her comrades, her family, and fled the apartment, leaving behind the skeleton of her beloved master. With that one word echoing in her mind, Jeanette jumped in the front seat of the car and taught herself to drive. They were going to get to Canada.
The three dogs fought and fought for over a week. They battled their ways through sieges, through swarms, through factories, through grocery stores, through the skeletons of the hundreds of humans who had died in their journey to Canada. So many had died. But these little dogs were making it.
They were less than two days away. They stopped at a trading camp one last time. The traders took pity on the three dogs and gave them some free ammo. The dogs were eterneally grateful.
But Rosalin had had all the guns.
The dogs didn't have any guns.
One last stop before reaching Canada.
They were trapped in a house.
It was a siege. They just had to survive long enough and then escape.
Zomies were raining from the ceilings, flooding through the door as a flood of death and gore. No other human had ever gotten this far before. Not even close. But these dogs. These brave dogs, Jeanette, Jeanin, Virginia... they had done what no other human had done. They had gotten to Canada.
Almost.
Jeanette was the first to die as she desperately tried to lead the pack of zombies away from her comrades and from the door which would soon be open. But the house was too small. She was overwhelmed.
Jeanin took over. Sweet little Virginia was being overwhelmed. Jeanin ran in, batting the zombie away, scratching and biting them to protect Virginia, who was quickly becoming tired. Jeanin succeeded in her goal, but only after she died.
Virginia. She was all alone. The zombies were busy feasting upon the carcasses of Jeanette and Jeanin. Virginia ran towards the door. The siege wasn't over but it was almost time for that blessed door to be free. She would be ready.
But the zombies were far more ready than she was.
They were waiting right outside the door and came rushing in to greet her. Virginia fought her way to the door and tried to leave.
""It is unsafe to go outside right now.""
She couldn't leave. Not yet. She tried to run away. She fought and fought and fought... but it was all for naught. She was less than a foot away from the exit.
The zombies circled her and Virginia's body fell to the floor as they bit and scratched her. Her blood was ripped out from her veins and her limbs were devoured by the growling mass of zombies. As her soul slowly left her eyes, she could see one last sign...
""The siege is over. It's safe to go outside.""
One day away.
One driving day away from Canada.
Almost.

10/10 would get a pack of dogs to drive a car to Canada again."

												I can't tell you how much I love this game. This game easily became my favorite game of 2016 just because of how great it really is. Death Road To Canada is a special kind of game that uses things we have seen in other games, such as organ trail, but heavily improves on. From making friends and family as survivors, to laugh out loud funny moments, DRTC is well worth the asking price of $15. If you don't have this game, you should get it ASAP. There's something about killing zombies, telling everyone to ""COOL IT"" and fighting bigfoot that really keeps you into it. I love this game and I want to thank the dev for just blessing us with such a treat. DRTC is a must have for just about everyone, and I cannot wait to see how much more will be added on to this already amazing game. 10/10"

The two comrades happened upon a junkyard that had a decent car. At the junkyard was another dog that joined them in their new car. Jeanin was one of them now. Their family was growing. They were all smiles and laughs. Jeanette loved to stick her fluffy doggy head out the window.
And another dog, Virginia, found them on the road and joined them! Rosalin was surrounded by sweet, loving, zombie-killing dogs. What more could she ask for?
But one apartment... there were too many zombies. Rosalin was seperated from her beloved dog. She slashed at the rotting zombies with her rusty machete but she was too tired. Her arms went limp at her side as she felt teeth rip into her flesh. She looked at Jeanette one last time... her last breath was a single, whispering word:
""Canada.""
The fluffy little dog gathered up her friends, her comrades, her family, and fled the apartment, leaving behind the skeleton of her beloved master. With that one word echoing in her mind, Jeanette jumped in the front seat of the car and taught herself to drive. They were going to get to Canada.
The three dogs fought and fought for over a week. They battled their ways through sieges, through swarms, through factories, through grocery stores, through the skeletons of the hundreds of humans who had died in their journey to Canada. So many had died. But these little dogs were making it.
They were less than two days away. They stopped at a trading camp one last time. The traders took pity on the three dogs and gave them some free ammo. The dogs were eterneally grateful.
But Rosalin had had all the guns.
The dogs didn't have any guns.
One last stop before reaching Canada.
They were trapped in a house.
It was a siege. They just had to survive long enough and then escape.
Zomies were raining from the ceilings, flooding through the door as a flood of death and gore. No other human had ever gotten this far before. Not even close. But these dogs. These brave dogs, Jeanette, Jeanin, Virginia... they had done what no other human had done. They had gotten to Canada.
Almost.
Jeanette was the first to die as she desperately tried to lead the pack of zombies away from her comrades and from the door which would soon be open. But the house was too small. She was overwhelmed.
Jeanin took over. Sweet little Virginia was being overwhelmed. Jeanin ran in, batting the zombie away, scratching and biting them to protect Virginia, who was quickly becoming tired. Jeanin succeeded in her goal, but only after she died.
Virginia. She was all alone. The zombies were busy feasting upon the carcasses of Jeanette and Jeanin. Virginia ran towards the door. The siege wasn't over but it was almost time for that blessed door to be free. She would be ready.
But the zombies were far more ready than she was.
They were waiting right outside the door and came rushing in to greet her. Virginia fought her way to the door and tried to leave.
""It is unsafe to go outside right now.""
She couldn't leave. Not yet. She tried to run away. She fought and fought and fought... but it was all for naught. She was less than a foot away from the exit.
The zombies circled her and Virginia's body fell to the floor as they bit and scratched her. Her blood was ripped out from her veins and her limbs were devoured by the growling mass of zombies. As her soul slowly left her eyes, she could see one last sign...
""The siege is over. It's safe to go outside.""
One day away.
One driving day away from Canada.
Almost.

10/10 would get a pack of dogs to drive a car to Canada again."

												For me, the thing that really makes this game fun is putting friends and family into the game and watching the chaos that ensues.  The game plays a bit like Oregon Trail in terms of managing resources like food and bullets while traveling across the country.  You also have to make decisions about how to handle various situations that come up, like running into a massive group of zombies and having to decide whether to take a detour or try to plow through them.  Depending on the traits of your characters, you may have additional options in these instances.  

The other half of the game is running around city streets and various buildings searching for supplies while avoiding getting killed by zombies.  The combat can feel a little clunky, particularly when dealing with doors and corners, but doesn't detract from the game too much.  Character movement also feels a little flawed.  Navigating corners and narrow spaces can get a bit frustrating when your character seemingly gets stuck on nothing.  I also found the companion AI to be a bit annoying at times.  Their path-finding can be frustrating, they will often continue to walk into objects instead of just walking around them.

This game really shines in it's character design, decision making, and quirky humor.  You're able to give your characters a perk, like mechanical or medical skills, and personality trait, like being calm under fire or paranoid.  It creates humorous situations like when your co-worker complains about Mondays the whole trip, or when your fitness obsessed friend challenges bandits to a body builder pose-off.  

Overall I found this game to be a very enjoyable experience.  I would recommend this game to people who enjoy replaying games to see all the different outcomes to different decisions you make.  If your goal is to just get through the game to see the end, there may not be enough value here for you.  Otherwise, there's enough content to warrent playing the game multiple times, even after finshing it."

												Death Road to Canada is a joyous romp through Florida on your journey to the zombie-free country of Canada, filled with guns, gas, and blood. It takes the formula of Organ Trail and beefs it up with a healthy dose of Dead Rising’s furniture-smashing chaos and Scott Pilgrim Vs. The Game’s retro Beat-Em-Up silliness and manages to combine it all into a fun, hilarious mess that’s addictive for hours on end. I’ve yet to make it to Canada alive yet, but where many games of its ilk have often made me give up on trying, Death Road to Canada’s optimism and forgiving nature made me feel that one day I could actually do it. Not to mention it’s a ton of fun! If there’s a game that could prove that the zombie genre isn’t quite out of fuel just yet, Death Road to Canada and the broken down lemon it rides around in is definitely that game.

												Ton'o'fun, really dig this game. 

It's a unique setup. It's sort of like Oregon / Organ Trail mixed with a lot of map encounters where you and your dudes (up to 2 local players, 4 in your team) have to avoid getting eaten by zombies when hunting for supplies. 

There is a good dose of randomness and it's hard and its fun.  There are a ton of positives and not that many negatives and it's a fair price.  And the dev seems to be from the 'update tons of ****' all the time' camp, which is a great reason to support the game. 

No reservations about recommending it. You'll know from a gameplay video if it is for you or not, I think it's great myself."

												I very rarely will invest money into a full price pixel art indie game, but this one was well worth the financial risk. There is an immense amount of replayability and gameplay variations spread throughout the game to keep you unaware of you're current time of day. This is something that would also be perfect to have on a 3ds or PS Vita, no doubt. 

There is a consistent sense of humour spread throughout in this game that does not feel forced in anyway. It's been a while since I've laughed at a video game's content. (Glitches and dumb multiplayer high jinks doesn't count)

Yeah, it's a good game. Give it a look!"

car, jocellyn drives away, game over because aparently goats can't drive and jocellyn lost interest going to canada.

												Great, somewhat random, but not, an exercise in patience with destiny as things happen over which you have very limited control, but are interesting to see happen.  Happily, it's interspersed with things over which you -do- have control (killing zombies in a continually cute and crunchy way).

												Lots of games have made me lose faith that developers even care about what they put into their games anymore. 
Death Road to Canada restores that faith in me.

If I were to sum up this entire game in two scenes that happened in this game, it would be these two.

A dog named Hershel told some guy with a shotgun to ""Cool It!,"" and then proceeeded to fart in this guy's face. This causes the guy to have an emotional breakdown, question what he's been doing with his life, and through some line of thinking, gives the dog his prized autoshotgun.

The same dog, Hershel, told a band of bandits to ""Cool It!,"" and the bandits completely forgot they were robbing the rest of my team, and just brutally murdered Hershel.

10/10
Made me feel more emotions than most games these days."

												This game takes me back to 2nd grade playing the Oregon Trail ... if zombies had been as popular then as they are now!  Silly, yet surprising difficult, the journey from Florida to Canada is frought with a variety of random events. From cars breaking down, surprised bandit attacks, zombie sieges - the game never lets you get too comfortable.  I will say that the difficulty definitely follows an ever increasing pattern. I have consistently struggled/lost the last of my party around the same time when I hit a particular string of bad luck and/or a really bad siege.

I can't be upset though - what other game lets you have a horse as a party member (poor thing was incredibly useless and it was very unfair to it that it was my last remaining party member and all it could do was NEIGH as it died) or blow up a truck of Twinkies (who knew they were explosive - though I always suspected it).

If you want a quick play with lots of humor and zombies, I'd highly recommend it!"

												The only game in existence that could make the apocalypse look like the funniest thing in the world.
And I really mean it, the soundtrack is glorious and betrays the whole atmosphere of the game.
Surrounded by zombies? This catchy tune will help you numb the pain.
No fuel for your car? How about something upbeat, so you won't think about your invetiable demise?
Swarmed by an army of zombies and no bullets left? Time for a groovy tune, to serve as your funeral song.

												Started the game off by creating my family (dad,mum,brother,nan,uncle and ME!!!!)
Turns out im not good at surviving and i was swiftly killed while trying to work out how the game worked.
My brother was still left though so i went on an adventure!
......And was then pinned down in a ""survive the horde"" sort of game.
Then i found my golf loving dad at a driving range wielding a golf club. 
Things were looking up!
I even replaced a persons head with a pugs head...... because you can do that in this game so why not XD
Then eventually all of the group died when they were left carless and were attempting to get another one.

In summary:
THIS GAME IS AWESOME!"

												First playthrough:  Was doing fine until we came across a goat, and I made the mistake of inviting him into the party. He immediately kicked and killed my lead character, was a jerk to everybody else in the car, and refused to leave the party when I came across another far more useful survivor. He refused to wield any useful weapons (preferring to drop them at the most inopportune times when we were being swarmed by zombies.) As he was the only character with any health left, I posted him on guard while the rest of the party slept, and he immediately fell asleep allowing all of our food and medical supplies to get stolen. Dangerously low on morale and health, he caused a huge argument that caused us to run off the road straight into a massive swarm of zombies, who massacred everyone but the goat. The goat then decided he didn't care two ☠☠☠☠s about Canada, and proceeded to walk off into the sunset. This is actually the closest I've come to winning the game so far.

10/10 - Would have my entire party killed by an evil backstabbing goat again."

My #1 complaint is poor AI companion pathfinding, and with such a small team, it may be a while before they can really sort it out.

Along the road we  had to deal with loads of bandits, got really beefy, and charmed a dog into giving us free bullets. Unfortunately we all died at the Canadian border shortly after kicking the first member of the team out for being a grade-A dink.
