												The shinobi transformation improved.
Higher quality oppai. What more can you ask?

Aside from the fanservice, the gameplay is smooth and works well. Fighting is harder than in Shinovi Versus since your character needs some time to regain balance but it makes for different style of play.

If you liked Shinovi Versus, you'll love this. For many reasons..."

												Sometimes a man just wants to enjoy giant anime tiddies without being judged by those on his friends list! Hahaha

Anyways, quality port that runs at smooth 60 (even when loaded up with ReShade to make them colors pop) with some various graphic options and 4K support. Think Dynasty Warriors but with an all female cast and obviously tons of fan service and you've got the gist of this game! Dumb, LEWD fun!"

												Marvelous have done an excellent job with the PC port of Senran Kagura, with resolution support up to 4k, and 2 FPS options of 30fps and 60fps. The FPS locks allow for a silky smooth experience on a very wide-range of hardware configurations, and the smooth framerate is essential to get the most out of this brawler.

I've played the PC port now for about 4 hours and haven't experienced any bugs, crashes, or technical issues of any kind, the PC port is rock solid, Koei Tecmo and Bandai Namco could learn a thing or 2 from Marvelous about how to port a game to Steam..

I already owned Senran Kagura Estival Versus on PS Vita so I'll draw on that experience to give a few thoughts on the game, now that we have established the port is perfect.

At it's core, Senran Kagura is a fan-service series, it is overtly sexual, and it embraces that, there is no pretense, the first cut-scene you see has a token shot of anime girl butt 20 seconds in which then proceeds to get spanked.
This kind of thing might seem shocking at first but the hilarious interactions, raunchy humour, and all-round great writing wouldn't be quite as good if the game wasn't so non-chalant with it's fan-service.

It's a shame that so many people (especially reviewers) can't get past this though, because underneath it's actually a very enjoyable, and mechanically-sound action-brawler. There are plenty of mechanics for you to take advantage of, dodges, blocks, different types of attacks, combos, special moves (which are themselves a more complicated mechanic than they first appear to be), transformations, mid-air combat, and these are just the things you'll be introduced to in the first 15 minutes.

As you play through the game you'll get access to different characters, who all play differently from each other, and there is also a great deal of character customisation and strategy involved prior to getting into a combat situation.

At the end of the day you'll mainly find yourself tackling hordes of enemies in the outlandish and mechanically brilliant brawler-style combat system, or sitting back and having a giggle at the hilarious character interactions and quirky humour, what more could you ask for?

The video below shows off all configuration options available on the PC port, as well as the first 4 minutes of gameplay. The opening cutscenes and sequences are skipped to avoid spoilers and get right in to showing off the combat and PC performance. [Mildly NSFW Warning: Anime Bum From The Very Beginning]

ＰＲＯＳ (Will mostly be comparing this one to the previous titles)
+Better gameplay 
+More playable characters
+Harder difficulties are now actually hard
+Animations are more fluid and the models are ＳＯＦＴＥＲ
+ＨＥＡＤＰＡＴＳ
+ＰＬＡＹＡＢＬＥ　ＫＡＧＵＲＡ

ＣＯＮＳ
-Keyboard controls are pretty awkward just like other console ports but a controller would easily solve this
-While I do not mind the repetitive gameplay since this is a musou game, grinding to max the yin, yang, and flash stats can be a huge pain in the ♥♥♥
-Some of the movesets were drastically changed
-Kagura doesn't have a shinobi girls heart mission

As for the story, it's actually enjoyable and the drama is pretty good unlike the previous titles which is mainly about slaying youmas or revenge. Character development can actually be felt here because of the longer dialogues.
And just like Plato once said ""Never trust anyone with less than 2 digits of game time on senrans.""

EDIT: Kissing is actually available in this version. Instructions on the comments thanks to my guy Yamato."

												Well after sitting down and playing this game all day (Over 10 hours) I feel confident in saying that it is just as great, if not better, than it's predecessor! 
I had my heart set on liking this game even before it came out and of course I jumped on it the second that it was released! 

As far as DLC content goes, I'm really satisfied so far! I bought all the character packs because it seemed like the right thing to do (more characters in an action game? No brainer for me!) and I definitely don't regret my purchase! I've read reviews on the mission packs and those can definitely wait until after you complete everything in game because the base game already has a ton for you to unlock and discover. 

This is a great action fighting game WITH boobs! Definitely worth the price tag and I have no regrets. 

Hikage is Life. 


10/10 would waste another full day stripping shinobi."

												I can see the majority of the fan base of this game is only playing for the charaters boobs and how they are animated. I am new to this type of game. I mean like anime and third person pc fighter. I only place third person games on console and this kinda changed my view on it. The game play is actually interesting if your not obsessed by the fact that they are all purposefully sexualized except one girl. I know i should've started at the first game instead of this one but this just came out and i know that online wont be cluttered and i have a close friend who has interest in this game. So im not necessarily calling this came good because of my friends or reviewers comments, im calling it good because aside the over use of boobs on this game it is an actual good game. Plus if they can make this type of game and have a good plot drwing others in with many ways then i do believe if they attempted a different game style they could accomplish such a thing."

												- ""This is a sequel of Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus right? should I get SV before playing this?""
  Yes, if you want to know the story. If not then just get this one. 
  Then again, it's up to you.

- ""I have SV, should I get this one?""
  Well, why not? Estival Versus has more contents.
  New playable characters, Photo mode, AI partner, ability to freely customize a character's transformation outfit, etc.

- ""Are the characters from SV playable in this game?""
  Yes, all of 'em are playable.

- ""Is the DLCs worth it?""
  Depends on yourself really.
  I, for example, would love to get all of 'em, but only bought half of the DLCs because. . .I couldn't afford all of 'em lel.
   -""Oh you're so poor""
     Oh you shut up.

  If you're struggling to choose which DLC to choose, I'd recommend Character DLCs. What about the other DLCs? well, it's kinda obvious.
  Costume DLCs if you like to customize the character's outfit. 
  Mission DLCs if you're looking for more challenges.
  BGM DLC if you're a BGM lover or just simply like the BGM from SV.

- ""I'm new to the series, is this game for me?""
  Do you like Hack&Slash? Are you alright with the playable characters being all female? Do you like Anime-style game? Do you like jiggly b**bs physics?

_ ""I personally don't like fanservice""
  Don't worry, it's not like your screen will be filled with b**bs and booty 90% of the time.

- ""Can I play with Keyboard and Mouse?""
  With Keyboard, yes. The game has KEYBINDINGS CUSTOMIZATION so no worries.

  When you've started for the first time however, the keybindings doesn't seem to work (yes, a bug, And currently they're working to fix it).
  In order to get it to work -> pause the game -> go to the settings -> you'll see that your keybindings are 'saved' -> you just need to re-assign the keybind the same as the one you've saved before (just one is enough) -> save settings -> resume the game -> enjoy.

  Dunno about the mouse since I play the game with keyboard only. The 'bug' probably affects mouse control too.



And. . .that's it.
Hope it helps.


Extra :

- ""This ****** weeb game shouldn't exist""
  Well, too bad it exist. Get rekt son.
  Oh, let me guess. You're gonna thumb down positive reviews as much as possible eh? hehehehe.

- ""This is an insult to real life wome-""
  Ssssshhhhhh. . . . .
  No it's not.
  And lemme guess again, You're gonna thumb down positive reviews as well huh? hehehehe.

Get off this page you Whippersnappers."

												While mainly known for fanservice, the Senran Kagura series generally offers a fun mix of fun gameplay, likeable characters and surprisingly interesting stories. As well as fanservice. Estival Versus is not only a good example of that, as of now it's the pinnacle of the franchise.

The main draw (aside from the obvious) is the hack-and-slash gameplay. The Versus subseries particularly takes elements from Koei's Warriors games, featuring many battles against hordes of weaker enemies, that are mauled, slaughtered and, at times, downright juggled. However, not all of them are completely weak. There are several types of mooks that put up quite a fight and can be pretty dangerous. Especially since they never come alone. This serves well to keep things interesting and prevent these battles from becoming too easy.

However, the focus is still the ""boss fights"" against the main characters, which is the most fun part of the game. While the ordinary enemies have limited possibilities, the bosses, essentially AI players, can do everything you can do (and then some). And with the difficulty being a step-up from SV, they're far from pushovers. Blindly charging and hacking away is rarely a good idea, as they attack quickly and can defend themselves well. At times, a bit too well, as the AI tends to blatantly cheat, which can be pretty frustrating.

When it comes to character selection, EV leaves little to be desired (unless you prefer flat-chested girls, but even those have a little representation) with at least 27 playable characters (with DLC increasing the roster up to 34). While some are of course similar, none are mere clones and everyone has traits that make them play different from everyone else. However, you don't have an entirely free selection. Not only are 3 characters locked at the beginning, the story mode enforces are playable character in every unfinished mission (although all of them can be replayed with every character). This ensures that all of them are properly represented, but it can be pretty frustrating, when you have to play with a character you just can't get a hang of.

Mission-wise, unlike SV (which had different storylines based on different factions) the game mainly features a single linear story. Which can be good (a more unified plot without continuity issues, being able to play every mission with every character independent of faction) or bad (not able to switch to different missions), depending on how you look at it. Aside from that, there are a bunch of character-focused missions that have to be unlocked through the main game. With every (non-DLC) character having 5 such missions, there's quite a lot to play through. DLCs also add several other kinds of side missions.

A mainstay of the series is the Dressing Room, where you can change the outfits the girls wear into battle or fool around with them. The selection is much better than before with the much-needed ability to use every outfit for normal and transformed states, a better color selection for every item, slots for accessories and swimsuits as normal outfits. It also has a Diorama mode, where you can place up to five characters in several poses in a picture. Nothing amazing but a neat feature.

Unlike SV, which was originally Vita-exclusive, EV also came out for PS4 and it shows in the much improved visuals. While the maps aren't anything special (although are pretty nice to look at), even when they're noticeably bigger, the characters really benefit from the upgrade. Not only do they look very accurate to their 2D designs, the graphics do a great job in showing them off in 3D. In a game focused on pretty and busty girls, quite an important point.

The music is pretty nice and good to listen to. However, I feel it's a step-down from SV. And while there is an option to use the SV soundtrack instead, it requires paid DLC.

Unlike what one would expect, I think this game could be suited for people who don't care about fanservice. Not so much for those who outright dislike it, as it's too pervasive. Naturally, people who love fanservice, particular the kind that features big and bouncy breasts, get the best experience.

Senran Kagura Estival Versus is a very good and well-rounded (in more ways than one) hack-and-slash game. It's nothing revolutionary, but it really doesn't need to be, it just needs to offer lots of fun and it does that well. And if you like a good dose of T&A (mostly T) with your ninja action game, you can't do much wrong with it."

												If you enjoy Dynasty Warriors you might get a kick out of this as it has a deeper combo system although it is lacking in level variety and there is hardly any objective-based gameplay or  or particularly interesting maps. You are trading cheesy voice acting for good voice acting with fun and often lewd dialogue. If you enjoyed Shinovi Versus you will like this sequel alot  as there is way less stunlocking, more mechanics, better controls and better graphics here.

Unfortunatly, I cannot recommend the PC version at all if you don't have a controller as the game uses controller prompts and the default keybindings (which can thankfully be changed) are terrible. It's incredibly frustrating to learn the combos when the game doesn't show keyboard prompts and there is no mouse control outside of the main menu.

Overall you are getting a pretty fun hack'n'slash with tons of characters, collectibles, missions and a killer soundtrack that blasts over everything with some nice eycandy. It's a shame that it's let down a bit by a mediocre PC Port.

Oh... and there are boobies too I guess... And ninjas.... And butts...

One issue I had though. I had to lock the framerate to 30 for the tutorial missions. After that you can change it back to 60. Its sheer torture, but its over quickly. If you don't your controls freeze and you can't do diddly s**t!

Aside from that, controller is very much recommended. The game looks good, didn't have any hitches or slowdowns. No crashes so far though some people are reporting those. Seems to be mostly happening on windows 10 as of this moment.

The game has great fanservice and a surprisingly fun combat system and a variety of characters with different fighting styles. Bueno."

												Quick review coming through. I'll compare it with its previous installment, so if you are new to the series, i would recommend other reviews that go into depth about what the game is about.

Pros:

-More  oppai  Senran Kagura. The game has a huge roster of characters to play as, bigger than ever. And this time, you can replay any stage as any character no matter the school. And character customization got even more ridiculous, being able to wear whatever you want, whenever you want (Pre/Transformation).

-Combat is more fluid than in SV, although, not as fast. But it sure feels more rewarding, and in higher difficulties, smashing buttons won't do you any good. That said, there's 3 difficulties so if you felt in SV like combat isn't your cup of tea but enjoyed the characters/bizarre situations, now is easier than ever to do so. Also, Hard is more challenging than in SV, something I appreciate.

-The port is superb. It runs flawlessly even on toasters, not a single FPS drop. Graphic settings are almost barebones but, overall, I can't complain seeing how well it runs. Also so far, not a single bug/CTD.

-More online game modes (Including ""co-op""). And the game can support up to 10 players in MP. It also comes with a great game browser. Sadly, atm, there's not many matches going on but I hope that soon enough, once people are done with the story or in future sales, the number increases. 

-More content than ever. You're gonna be entertained for quite some time. The main story is quite interesting, although I miss the rivalry from SV to spice things up between schools.

-Better production values. The addition of dynamic camera angles and the fluid animations during conversations make them feel more natural. There's also anime cutscenes, and only a few situations are explained using those infamous static backgrounds.

And now, to my main and only con:

-The DLC policy. With SV we got all the DLCs included in the package after being released 2 years later. In this case, we had to also wait for its release on PC (It was released 2 years ago in JP, but one after EU/NA release) but this time, we have to pay full price for all of them.

I can understand having to pay for the character DLCs that are released alongside the PC version. But having to pay (full price) for content that is more than a year old in other platforms in a re-release, is a no-no to me. Also the publisher wasn't clear at all the previous week before release about the content that would be included in the package. Thankfully, most DLCs are cosmetic and there's only a couple worth your time.

All that said, Estival Versus is a vastly improvement over SV in almost every possible way. If you enjoyed SV, this is a no brainer."

												 Target Audience:   Action Gamers Who Want Some Visual Flair. Ok, who like boobs, let's just put it bluntly.

 Summary:   
 Please note: The majority of play time here was spent with testing PC performance, as reviewer has already reviewed the gameplay/majority of game on the PS4
A good but not great port of a solid action game that won't change the genre, but will be a nice little experience. You should know what you get out of the Senran Kagura franchise: busty ninjas, action gameplay, and a little bit of cheese. Estival Versus for the most part delivers that: although there are some hiccups in this formula. The girls and their new mission sometimes don't match up in their characters: as the new format is a little more loose then other iterations. With that said, the humor is still here, and can lead to some hilarious moments, and there's more to then their obvious “assets” to their characters, especially with the family connections that develop in this game..

You're here for the visuals and the gameplay, and the PC port delivers a locked 60 FPS with no drops. The visuals and the presentation work rather well, with emphasis on animation and character movement working great for the lovely ladies here. And while the game play is repetitive, it's the difference in characters and how they play that help the variety keep the game going without it being too boring. While the story mode has you play everyone, you'll find a couple of characters you really love, and will go back and play levels trying to find platforms and get all the game has to offer. And of course finding the little animations of when you hit a girl into the environment, and they end up interacting with the world (which is always hilarious). 

It's a solid but not spectacular game. Good for some laughs, but if you're looking for the pinnacle of gameplay in the genre: it's not here. It's like the girls themselves, solid, having a nice look to them, but you question if you really want them to do an assassination job.

			XSEED usually doesn't hold back on it's fan service, and Senran Kagura: Estival Versus is no exception. But, there's a big question: does it also bring the Gameplay?		
	


 Lists: 
Positives:
 Each character is reasonably unique in implementation, leading to some reasonably different play styles. You'll pick up certain favorites, but I don't feel like a lot of them are copies of each other.
 The visuals are lovely, and yes, of course that's a reference to the girls as well. Animation is crisp, and the physics engine works well. God I feel dirty writing that.
 Humor works on the gag comedy level. It's not the most intelligent of writing, but given the material, it doesn't have to be. 
 Animations work well for the core material in question. Obviously having a girls clothes fly off is part what I'm talking about, but the battle animations and how they attack enemies over and over again also works rather nicely. 
 Colorful environment art and really nice to look at coloring work on the girls. High quality, and even at lower resolutions, it still looks lovely.
 Up to 4 K resolution, and decent options in terms of PC options. At least for a console port game.
 It may seem awkward at first, but controls work well for the battle type chosen here, especially for the controller. 
 For once, I actually like dressing up my characters in funny outfits and really taking advantage of that in game. It doesn't feel like a chore. Yes, I'm playing fashion model. I don't care. It's fun. 
 And there's actually some rather touching moments given the games events. Some of them may come down to things that people would consider “cheesy”, but given these characters, I really believe that some of them work. And you do buy some of the difficulty that some of these characters will end up going through.
 Difficulties are well implemented, although the default difficulty being easy is a little meh. 
 Higher difficulties actually does make you have to take a step back against the AI and actually use that pesky dodge and block button. Which is nice to see. 
 Performance is locked at 60 FPS, but it also never drops. Ever. Regardless of if 100 enemies are on the screen, and you're doing a super attack. While I would have loved for it to be unlocked (and given the community I wouldn't be surprised if they find a way to do that), it's acceptable for the default PC port performance.
Negatives:
 Series veterans will note that some of the characters don't come off as normally as they would in the entire series. Some of them will make you pause even if you don't, cause given the character they've built, it just doesn't seem like them.
 The default PC controls are confusing to say the least. With K being a confirmation button, and the default camera controls being on the numpad, it makes absolutely no sense. You've got bindable keys, but frankly, I'm still wondering who made the default controls, they make no sense..
 There is an element of repetition over the course of the gameplay, and that's not going away. They've got some elements in terms of variety in destroy platforms and facing different enemy heroes, but frankly, you'll be defeating things the same way over and over again, and you may start to get bored over time if you're not used to this type of game.
 If you're expecting Musou gameplay, while the action here, the strategy is not in terms of location based gameplay. 
 There's RPG elements here to build characters....but I honestly feel like it could have been thrown out and I'd be none the wiser. 
 Wanted a tiny more variety in the default foot soldiers in terms of their combat style. Sure, you get some, but later in the game I found myself really ignoring them and going for the other heroes. 
 Do wish there was one more system to the gameplay to really take the variety to the next level. I felt like if they added this, it would put the game on a whole different platform.
 There's a lot of little things that bother me and annoy me in this game. Things like the difficulty in the story mode always defaulting to easy, even if the last levels I beat were on normal."

												I'm an idiot for still buying these games. They're not good. They're total mindless button mashers. Every character uses the same combo for everything. XXXYBXXXY. They're awful by any gameplay standard you attempt to measure them by: Brawler, character action, musou.

Oh right, now I remember why, it's right there on the box. The animu tiddies. The waifu cast in this game is somehow even better than Shinovi Versus, if you can believe it. (Well, nobody is better than Yumi...). The crisp, anime art looks absolutely beautiful in action. Everything is so smooth... and soft... and bouncy... There's not a second of this game that isn't gorgeous to look at.

True to series form, there is a lot of plot this time around, and it is about as dumb as you expect. It bounces back and forth from ""Waaah my dead sister is back and I still can't swallow my pride to make up with her."" to... well... Give me some space here.

""I know, let's have a boob grabbing competition!""
""N-nani! Th-that's not right!""
""Oh, are you scared you'll lose?""
""... ngh, I'm no coward! Fine, I accept! Your boobs will fall prey to my fearsome grip!""
(Spoilers you don't actually get to grab boobs it's a normal fight.)

Look, you know why you want Senran Kagura. Everyone knows. I'm honest about it too. It's stupid. There's nothing to the gameplay and almost nothing to the plot. But it's absolutely gorgeous.

And Yumi is the best girl and I love kicking all your other trash waifus asses with her."

												If your game is lagging, it might be defaulted using integrated graphic card. Change it in your respective card setting (in my case it's Nvidia Control Panel). I switched from Intel integrated to my GT930M and every battle goes smoothly.

As for the game itself, ESTIVAL VERSUS is huge improvement from its predecessor. Use of better models, improvement for nearly every features, and of course larger roster of characters to play. Quality port reassured.
Fully supporting my favorite illustrator Yaegashi Nan.

Thank you for porting ESTIVAL VERSUS to its fullest!"

			Episode 150: Busted Reviewed and edited by Seraph/Sam Today we look at the PC version of Senran Kagura: Estival Versus. A little late than never but how does it fare? Find out in today's review!		
	


Originally released in Japan for the Playstation 4 and Playstation Vita on March 26 2015 with North American and European releases following on March 15 and March 18 2016 respectively, we have Senran Kagura: Estival Versus. What you’re seeing here is the PC version of the game which was released on March 17 2017 and for transparency, I was given a copy of this game via a PR network. Developed by Tamsoft and published by Marvelous in Japan and Europe with XSEED handling the game in North America, Senran Kagura: Estival Versus is the seventh game in the Senran Kagura series and the fifth game to be released in English. The eighth game Senran Kagura: Peach Beach Splash was released for Playstation 4 in Japan on March 16 2017 and I’ll be covering that game in a future review. 

In Estival Versus, our four teams of shinobi get transported to a mysterious island by Sayuri, the grandmother of Asuka, the leader of Hanzo for the Kagura Millennium Festival where dead shinobi with regrets are temporarily brought over to the world of the living where they can be laid to rest. As well as that, our four teams as well as the overseers of the festival; the Mikagura sisters are to participate in the Shinobi Bon Dance, a battle royale of sorts where each team must destroy platforms belonging to the other teams with the reward being the road opening up to the status of Kagura, the highest status in the Shinobi World. On top of that, you’ll also get the light hearted humour and slice of life moments in between, but is the game any good? Find out in…

[THE GOOD]

I found the gameplay of Estival Versus is quite an improvement over Shinovi Versus. The game includes a few new elements such as wall running and attacks as well as Fusion Aerial Raves where if you’re playing a mission with a teammate, you can perform a combination attack of sorts. You can also pick up bomb shells with do various things such as freezing or paralysing the opponent to even summoning grunts or a ridable mech for you to deal more damage with which is pretty fun. Another thing introduced to the game are Creative Finishers where if your opponent is defeated near certain areas (reflected by a signpost with an exclamation mark on it), they fall into the trap in that area whilst losing all their clothes. While some are a little over the top, this is to be expected in a Senran Kagura game and I feel it adds to the charm. However in comparison to Shinovi Versus, the gameplay does feel a bit slower so I wouldn’t be expecting a lot of fast paced gameplay.

I quite enjoyed the Shinobi Girls Heart Missions that I unlocked over the course of the game. In certain levels you’ll find festival platforms that you need to destroy. Some of these platforms can be a bit out of the way or hidden and some require you to think outside the box on how to reach them. Once a certain amount of them have been destroyed you’ll start unlocking Shinobi Girls Heart Missions which are 5 stages where you play as a certain character. These missions also tell a small story whether it’s Miyabi wanting everyone to call her a hunk or Asuka’s grandfather switching bodies with her, the missions act as a small slice of life tales to the game, complete with a CG for the ending.

Diorama mode is a returning feature I also enjoyed too. Returning from Senran Kagura 2: Deep Crimson on the 3DS, and as an expansion of the Dressing Room mode of the original, the Diorama mode allows you to dress up characters and have them pose in backgrounds. The costumes you give the characters can also be used in battle too so feel free to experiment around and customize the girls to your liking.

The game also introduces a bunch of characters with a number of them being DLC. Returning characters include Rin and Daidouji who were originally introduced through a free update. New characters introduced include Naraku and True Kagura who first appeared in Senran Kagura 2: Deep Crimson as well as the shopkeeper and member of Hanzo Academy Ayame making their first playable appearance (New Wave doesn’t count). The game also features crossover characters such as Ayane from the Dead or Alive series and most notable, three characters from Ikkitousen. Originally due to licencing issues the Ikkitousen girls weren’t available, but after some negotiations, they were allowed in, however, they’re identified by the Three Kingdoms hero they represent. Each character I’ve found DLC or not also plays differently so it’s easy enough to pick a character that you’ll work well with. But, all’s not well with the game so with that we’ll move onto…

[THE BAD]

While the game has you play through as certain Shinobi, the one I felt was most left out of a playable role was Homura the leader of her Crimson Squad having the only playable story role in a Tutorial mission. While the game has you playing as just about every character at least twice, I feel that out of the team leaders, Homura really gets shafted for playable roles. On the plus side, you can replay completed missions as any character and Homura does get a Shinobi Girls Heart series of missions, but I feel that she’s a little unrepresented in this instalment.

The game from my understanding is a little bit on the buggy side as well. While I have come across bugs in which my game’s crashed or I’ve been forced to quit the game through ALT + F4, I’ve been one of the luckier ones, as I’ve heard from some folks playing the game that they’ve been forced to quit the game as early as the tutorial missions. Hopefully though the game does get patched soon so people don’t have to put up with this.

I also felt that the story was all over the place and some of the translation changes didn’t make much sense. While it does take a much more serious turn near the end, I felt that a lot of the story was padded with filler content and situations if you excuse the pun. One of them for instance has Miyabi the leader of the revived Hebijo group attacking the Mikagura Sisters over Sugar and Soy sauce to make an Egg Rice bowl with her mother and one that bugged me was where Shiki, one of the Gessen members was, according to the translation learning French when in the original and clearly in the dialogue it’s English. Asides from that, I don’t really have much else to complain about so it’s now time I give…

[THE OPINION]

Senran Kagura: Estival Versus, bugs aside is a fun game that people will either like or hate. Under the gratuitous fan-service, I’ve found the game does have a more serious outlook and explores themes around reuniting with dead loved ones while throwing in the trademark humour the series has since been well known for. If fan-service is your thing and if you’re a fan of the series, I’d say pick the game up. For the additional characters and missions, you’ll be paying out the ♥♥♥ in DLC. I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing the game and I’m looking forward to what the series has in store for the future after Peach Beach Splash."

+ The gameplay is surprisingly fun. It's similar to the Dynasty Warriors series where you pull off various combos while fighting through hundreds of enemies. 
+ TONS of characters each with their own weapons, special abilities, and unique personalities.
+ Lengthly cutscenes with humerous dialogue
+ Very sexually teasing as there's a lot of playful nudity as you transform to different outfits, and tear off enemy clothing.
+ Visually the game looks amazing, very vibrant with a great anime style.
+ Great soundtrack

- The missions are a bit too reptitive after a while, and essentially have you doing the same thing with a different character each time. 
- Personally I felt like there was a bit too much dialogue after each mission. You'll likely be reading more than actually playing the game. Along with that it seems like a lot of the scenes are somewhat random and a bit silly. Some scenes are just an image with text overlayed on top which felt a bit lazy."

												It has Ryofu, I dont need anything else...

*cough*

alright, for the one who enjoyed senran kagura Shinovi Versus (SKSV), I 100% recommend this title. it has improvement in many things from SV. this review is also consider my playtime from PS4 Japanese version of this game (got platinum).

for someone new to this title, Senran Kagura Estival Versus (SKEV) is hack and slash action between all girl shinobi that has many fanservice going around, but don't be fooled, not like most fanservicey game, SKEV actually has a great gameplay that you can enjoy if you like hack and slash action game. I recommend getting SKSV first if you care about story, but if you only care about gameplay, SKEV is better. 

for comparison with SKSV, combats feels more fluid and balanced, no one feel overpowered (except for some DLC char). now support up to 10 person multiplayer (haven't checked how smooth). it also feels optimized with constant 60 fps for my PC. you better have controller to play this game though, seriously, get one for action game like this.

Story is begin after the events of the special OVA (watch it on youtube or somewhere, recommended, but not required as it's only mentioned on prologue of the story). the girls is now summoned to attend special shinobi ceremony. yes, that's the plot, story progress might be a bit weaker now, but instead we got alot more in depth info of each characters in senran kagura.

Pros :
+ Good Quick hack and slash action
+ alot of girls to choose from
+ Bouncy Fanservice
+ Other features like Photo mode for more ""intimate"" time to your favorit characters
+ ""Creative"" Finish
+ Multiplayer up to 10 person
+ Ryofu (for me)

Cons :
- Story is a bit weaker than SKSV
- can quickly get repetitive, as there only a little variation in single player mode

to Summarize :
- You like hack and slash and anime graphic? : get it
- You like hack and slash with good story? : consider other title first, try SKSV
- You like bouncy anime boobs? : ♥♥♥♥ING GET IT!
- You like Ikkitousen : JUST GET IT! not like that many game you can play as one of Ikkitousen characters."

												I can see the majority of the fan base of this game is only playing for the charaters boobs and how they are animated. I am new to this type of game. I mean like anime and third person pc fighter. I only place third person games on console and this kinda changed my view on it. The game play is actually interesting if your not obsessed by the fact that they are all purposefully sexualized except one girl. I know i should've started at the first game instead of this one but this just came out and i know that online wont be cluttered and i have a close friend who has interest in this game. So im not necessarily calling this came good because of my friends or reviewers comments, im calling it good because aside the over use of boobs on this game it is an actual good game. Plus if they can make this type of game and have a good plot drwing others in with many ways then i do believe if they attempted a different game style they could accomplish such a thing."

												We can all agree that nobody come to play Senran Kagura for the characters, the writing or the gameplay. Yet the makers have put an incredible ammount of effort into exactly those areas. All of the clevages on the screen have very fun and endearing things to say and some stories can be surprisingly emotional. Be it one holding her pain in just long enough for her mother to die in peace, another realizing that joy in the now is fleeting nd can't last forever or another finally accepting that groping women's boobs is only  statisfying for so long and that there are also butts, legs and bellies to grope (haven't we all been there?)
Personally, I can't wait for someone to make a tool to lower the jiggling a bit and maybe adjust the bust sizes to make the characters more distinct as with the last entry. 
Still, this is a shamefully fun game with a lot of humor, quirk and fanservice."

												このゲームは馬鹿ゲーに属する  愛すべきお色気馬鹿ゲー
-My Rant LoL-
他のアクションゲームと比べて少し単調だとは思いますが、まあまあ楽しい
オンラインに関してですが、初心者はまともに対戦できません
私は回線強度の表示はマックスですが、たててある部屋に入るとだいたいすぐキックされます
今のところ、１回だけ対戦できましたが５回キックされました。「誰でも歓迎」という部屋名でもキックされます
自分で部屋をたてても、入ってきた人はこちらが初心者だとわかるとすぐ抜けます
初心者と戦ってもつまらないという気持ちはわからなくはありませんが、、、つらい
オンにけっこう期待してたので残念
感想::ゲーム性アクションが爽快だと聞いていたことと、キャラクターデザインが可愛いことで、発売を待つまでの間に期待値がわりと高くなっていたのですが、実際にプレイしたみたところ、十分に満足できる内容でした。
主なゲーム内容としては、ストーリーモードと個別シナリオモード、更衣室の鑑賞モード、様々なゲーム内容とステージを設定できるオンライン対戦モード（対人だけでなく、人間 VS CPUでもできる）。一戦がさほど長くないので、どれも気楽に楽しめます。
さておき、ゲームシステム。このゲームの最大の特徴は戦闘しているキャラクターの服を破壊できることであり、しかも衣装破壊にモーションがついていること。さらに衣装破壊時に、ステージに設置されている「！」という立て看板付近で相手を倒すと専用のフィニッシュモーションが発動することです。
衣装が破壊されて恥じらいながら身悶える可愛いキャラクター達が盛りだくさんというだけで、実に戦う意欲がわいてきます。爆乳が多いので揺れますし、太もものぷにぷに感には多幸感すら覚えるほどです。ステージ攻略時には「この為に戦っていたんだ」とプレイヤーを満足させること必至です。
そのうえキャラクターを着替えさせることや髪型、色を変更することも出来て、ストーリーモードなどでのキャラ使用時にはその衣装を反映さえることができるという。
ちなみに、先に挙げた更衣室の鑑賞モードでは、そんな可愛い子たちに触ることもできます。ポーズを取らせることもできます。可愛い。
シリーズ未プレイの弊害としては、キャラの関係性がややわかりづらいということでしょうか。まあ、キャラクターが可愛いことには変わりないのでさほど気にならないと思います。

総合感想
グラフィックやお色気要素は大幅にパワーアップしました
が、ゲームとしての面白さは少しパワーダウンしてしまった印象です
操作キャラが増え飽きにくくはなっているものの、アクション面のテンポが主に硬直の影響でそがれてしまい集中できないように感じました
アクションゲームとしての面白さも求めると前作に一歩ゆずってしまう印象でしょうか
ただ、お色気要素やキャラクターの魅力は相変わらずなので、アクション面を気にしないのであれば楽しめる作品かと思います
 

Note:
ちょいエロ要素を楽しみたくて購入したが、思いの外たのしく、すぐハマりました。ストーリーも楽しめた。キャラも多く、軽い無双系なので好きです。ストーリーの長さはキャラ多いからサイドストーリーもう少し多くてもと感じた(割りと充分あるけども)。更衣室系は着替えぐらいしかしてないけど、そこでポーズ取らせて写真撮れるのが、好きな人にはドハマりするらしいんでやってみてはどうでしょうか。

こんな人にオススメ
・超ド直球のお色気ゲームが好きな人
・ゲームキャラにに男なんて必要ないぜという人
・女の子の着せ替えをしたい人
・グラフィックは良いに決まっているという人"

												Very good!
One issue I had though. I had to lock the framerate to 30 for the tutorial missions. After that you can change it back to 60. Its sheer torture, but its over quickly. If you don't your controls freeze and you can't do diddly s**t!

Aside from that, controller is very much recommended. The game looks good, didn't have any hitches or slowdowns. No crashes so far though some people are reporting those. Seems to be mostly happening on windows 10 as of this moment.

The game has great fanservice and a surprisingly fun combat system and a variety of characters with different fighting styles. Bueno."

												- ""This is a sequel of Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus right? should I get SV before playing this?""
  Yes, if you want to know the story. If not then just get this one. 
  Then again, it's up to you.

- ""I have SV, should I get this one?""
  Well, why not? Estival Versus has more contents.
  New playable characters, Photo mode, AI partner, ability to freely customize a character's transformation outfit, etc.

- ""Are the characters from SV playable in this game?""
  Yes, all of 'em are playable.

- ""Is the DLCs worth it?""
  Depends on yourself really.
  I, for example, would love to get all of 'em, but only bought half of the DLCs because. . .I couldn't afford all of 'em lel.
   -""Oh you're so poor""
     Oh you shut up.

  If you're struggling to choose which DLC to choose, I'd recommend Character DLCs. What about the other DLCs? well, it's kinda obvious.
  Costume DLCs if you like to customize the character's outfit. 
  Mission DLCs if you're looking for more challenges.
  BGM DLC if you're a BGM lover or just simply like the BGM from SV.

- ""I'm new to the series, is this game for me?""
  Do you like Hack&Slash? Are you alright with the playable characters being all female? Do you like Anime-style game? Do you like jiggly b**bs physics?

_ ""I personally don't like fanservice""
  Don't worry, it's not like your screen will be filled with b**bs and booty 90% of the time.

- ""Can I play with Keyboard and Mouse?""
  With Keyboard, yes. The game has KEYBINDINGS CUSTOMIZATION so no worries.

  When you've started for the first time however, the keybindings doesn't seem to work (yes, a bug, And currently they're working to fix it).
  In order to get it to work -> pause the game -> go to the settings -> you'll see that your keybindings are 'saved' -> you just need to re-assign the keybind the same as the one you've saved before (just one is enough) -> save settings -> resume the game -> enjoy.

  Dunno about the mouse since I play the game with keyboard only. The 'bug' probably affects mouse control too.



And. . .that's it.
Hope it helps.

  Well, too bad it exist. Get rekt son.

												Well after sitting down and playing this game all day (Over 10 hours) I feel confident in saying that it is just as great, if not better, than it's predecessor! 
I had my heart set on liking this game even before it came out and of course I jumped on it the second that it was released! 

As far as DLC content goes, I'm really satisfied so far! I bought all the character packs because it seemed like the right thing to do (more characters in an action game? No brainer for me!) and I definitely don't regret my purchase! I've read reviews on the mission packs and those can definitely wait until after you complete everything in game because the base game already has a ton for you to unlock and discover. 

This is a great action fighting game WITH boobs! Definitely worth the price tag and I have no regrets.

This one supports 2560x1440 resolution at 60fps like all the others and Estival versus seems like the best quality port of all the games they released on steam. It is a fun fanservice beat em up with nice music and some anime cutscenes.

fan-service is the reason why people buy the game, i am aware of it, but the gameplay is fun as well.

More focus towards the gameplay and making the fan-service implict

*cough*

alright, for the one who enjoyed senran kagura Shinovi Versus (SKSV), I 100% recommend this title. it has improvement in many things from SV. this review is also consider my playtime from PS4 Japanese version of this game (got platinum).

for someone new to this title, Senran Kagura Estival Versus (SKEV) is hack and slash action between all girl shinobi that has many fanservice going around, but don't be fooled, not like most fanservicey game, SKEV actually has a great gameplay that you can enjoy if you like hack and slash action game. I recommend getting SKSV first if you care about story, but if you only care about gameplay, SKEV is better. 

for comparison with SKSV, combats feels more fluid and balanced, no one feel overpowered (except for some DLC char). now support up to 10 person multiplayer (haven't checked how smooth). it also feels optimized with constant 60 fps for my PC. you better have controller to play this game though, seriously, get one for action game like this.

Story is begin after the events of the special OVA (watch it on youtube or somewhere, recommended, but not required as it's only mentioned on prologue of the story). the girls is now summoned to attend special shinobi ceremony. yes, that's the plot, story progress might be a bit weaker now, but instead we got alot more in depth info of each characters in senran kagura.

Pros :
+ Good Quick hack and slash action
+ alot of girls to choose from
+ Bouncy Fanservice
+ Other features like Photo mode for more ""intimate"" time to your favorit characters
+ ""Creative"" Finish
+ Multiplayer up to 10 person
+ Ryofu (for me)

Cons :
- Story is a bit weaker than SKSV
- can quickly get repetitive, as there only a little variation in single player mode

to Summarize :
- You like hack and slash and anime graphic? : get it
- You like hack and slash with good story? : consider other title first, try SKSV
- You like bouncy anime boobs? : ♥♥♥♥ING GET IT!
- You like Ikkitousen : JUST GET IT! not like that many game you can play as one of Ikkitousen characters."

Ryōna in Shinovi i can just spam Y Button to get massive amount of AOE Combo but in Estival i can't do that. 
because of animation at the end of their abilities last longer in this one.
but overall the animation and model and looks smoother just the highlight on their eyes is kinda... weird for me.

												If you enjoy Dynasty Warriors you might get a kick out of this as it has a deeper combo system although it is lacking in level variety and there is hardly any objective-based gameplay or  or particularly interesting maps. You are trading cheesy voice acting for good voice acting with fun and often lewd dialogue. If you enjoyed Shinovi Versus you will like this sequel alot  as there is way less stunlocking, more mechanics, better controls and better graphics here.

Unfortunatly, I cannot recommend the PC version at all if you don't have a controller as the game uses controller prompts and the default keybindings (which can thankfully be changed) are terrible. It's incredibly frustrating to learn the combos when the game doesn't show keyboard prompts and there is no mouse control outside of the main menu.

Overall you are getting a pretty fun hack'n'slash with tons of characters, collectibles, missions and a killer soundtrack that blasts over everything with some nice eycandy. It's a shame that it's let down a bit by a mediocre PC Port.

Oh... and there are boobies too I guess... And ninjas.... And butts...

												I have probably put in 100+ hours on my Vita, but this version is a PS4 port. So far it is completely stable, just like their port of older games. If you like Dynasty Warriors (I am a massive fan of that gameplay), and appreciate a bit of fan service, you will find your holy grail here, complete with 4K and 60fps support. Embrace the 3D Anime Waifu action!

												My first hour with Estival Versus was met with nothing but frustration. Between wrestling with the keybindings, giving up on the display settings, fuming at how typically Japanese the sloppy PC port is and gritting my teeth at the slower combat mechanics compared to its prodecessor, I wondered if they learned anything at all from Shinovi Versus.

The linear story progression forces you to sit through tutorials and you'll have to use characters you dislike every now and then (Mirai, how I loathe thee with a passion). Similar games like Samurai Warriors or Sengoku Basara has a lot more freedom of choice and lets you go at your own pace.

On top of all that are the DLCs which you must purchase separately. After the full package that is Shinovi Versus, this leaves a bit of a sour taste.

Once you get over all that downsides, find some workarounds and actually start fighting though, it's pure unadulterated bahonkas. Having long recovery times after combo and dashes means taking more deliberation in your actions, making combat a little more thoughtful than spamming dash-cancels to eternity and beyond like its prodecessor.

Visually there's no complaints here. It's a big and vibrant step-up from Shinovi Versus. Better shading, anisotropic filter and cleaner outlines. Helps that all the girls are cute badasses too.

Estival Versus is still not for everyone. It's grindy, repetitive and is downright unashamed of nudity and fanservice. If you're okay with that though, you will feel right at home here.

												Marvelous have done an excellent job with the PC port of Senran Kagura, with resolution support up to 4k, and 2 FPS options of 30fps and 60fps. The FPS locks allow for a silky smooth experience on a very wide-range of hardware configurations, and the smooth framerate is essential to get the most out of this brawler.

I've played the PC port now for about 4 hours and haven't experienced any bugs, crashes, or technical issues of any kind, the PC port is rock solid, Koei Tecmo and Bandai Namco could learn a thing or 2 from Marvelous about how to port a game to Steam..

I already owned Senran Kagura Estival Versus on PS Vita so I'll draw on that experience to give a few thoughts on the game, now that we have established the port is perfect.

At it's core, Senran Kagura is a fan-service series, it is overtly sexual, and it embraces that, there is no pretense, the first cut-scene you see has a token shot of anime girl butt 20 seconds in which then proceeds to get spanked.
This kind of thing might seem shocking at first but the hilarious interactions, raunchy humour, and all-round great writing wouldn't be quite as good if the game wasn't so non-chalant with it's fan-service.

It's a shame that so many people (especially reviewers) can't get past this though, because underneath it's actually a very enjoyable, and mechanically-sound action-brawler. There are plenty of mechanics for you to take advantage of, dodges, blocks, different types of attacks, combos, special moves (which are themselves a more complicated mechanic than they first appear to be), transformations, mid-air combat, and these are just the things you'll be introduced to in the first 15 minutes.

As you play through the game you'll get access to different characters, who all play differently from each other, and there is also a great deal of character customisation and strategy involved prior to getting into a combat situation.

At the end of the day you'll mainly find yourself tackling hordes of enemies in the outlandish and mechanically brilliant brawler-style combat system, or sitting back and having a giggle at the hilarious character interactions and quirky humour, what more could you ask for?

The video below shows off all configuration options available on the PC port, as well as the first 4 minutes of gameplay. The opening cutscenes and sequences are skipped to avoid spoilers and get right in to showing off the combat and PC performance. [Mildly NSFW Warning: Anime Bum From The Very Beginning]

Shinovi versus, was not only tons of fun and had lots of content.
it also made me laugh. Its one of those few games left made to have fun.

It took every good aspect of shinove versus and made it 10 times better.

More customisation, CHECK
More Options, CHECK
Great port, CHECK
Online play, CHECK
Fun Gameplay, CHECK
Great story mode, CHECK

It has so much to do, there is allot of DLC right?
Tbh, i don't mind at all. I bought all of it.
why? well if you played Shinovi Versus, you know why.

Have fun guys ! choose the waifu, Beat up the rest.
Kick there asses, slap there asses, be amazed by the 4k support.
Customise you're character, go online, kick there asses again.
Slap it if you have to.

There is also allot of content.

自分で部屋をたてても、入ってきた人はこちらが初心者だとわかるとすぐ抜けます
初心者と戦ってもつまらないという気持ちはわからなくはありませんが、、、つらい
オンにけっこう期待してたので残念
感想::ゲーム性アクションが爽快だと聞いていたことと、キャラクターデザインが可愛いことで、発売を待つまでの間に期待値がわりと高くなっていたのですが、実際にプレイしたみたところ、十分に満足できる内容でした。
主なゲーム内容としては、ストーリーモードと個別シナリオモード、更衣室の鑑賞モード、様々なゲーム内容とステージを設定できるオンライン対戦モード（対人だけでなく、人間 VS CPUでもできる）。一戦がさほど長くないので、どれも気楽に楽しめます。
さておき、ゲームシステム。このゲームの最大の特徴は戦闘しているキャラクターの服を破壊できることであり、しかも衣装破壊にモーションがついていること。さらに衣装破壊時に、ステージに設置されている「！」という立て看板付近で相手を倒すと専用のフィニッシュモーションが発動することです。
衣装が破壊されて恥じらいながら身悶える可愛いキャラクター達が盛りだくさんというだけで、実に戦う意欲がわいてきます。爆乳が多いので揺れますし、太もものぷにぷに感には多幸感すら覚えるほどです。ステージ攻略時には「この為に戦っていたんだ」とプレイヤーを満足させること必至です。
そのうえキャラクターを着替えさせることや髪型、色を変更することも出来て、ストーリーモードなどでのキャラ使用時にはその衣装を反映さえることができるという。
ちなみに、先に挙げた更衣室の鑑賞モードでは、そんな可愛い子たちに触ることもできます。ポーズを取らせることもできます。可愛い。
シリーズ未プレイの弊害としては、キャラの関係性がややわかりづらいということでしょうか。まあ、キャラクターが可愛いことには変わりないのでさほど気にならないと思います。

総合感想
グラフィックやお色気要素は大幅にパワーアップしました
が、ゲームとしての面白さは少しパワーダウンしてしまった印象です
操作キャラが増え飽きにくくはなっているものの、アクション面のテンポが主に硬直の影響でそがれてしまい集中できないように感じました
アクションゲームとしての面白さも求めると前作に一歩ゆずってしまう印象でしょうか
ただ、お色気要素やキャラクターの魅力は相変わらずなので、アクション面を気にしないのであれば楽しめる作品かと思います
 

Note:
ちょいエロ要素を楽しみたくて購入したが、思いの外たのしく、すぐハマりました。ストーリーも楽しめた。キャラも多く、軽い無双系なので好きです。ストーリーの長さはキャラ多いからサイドストーリーもう少し多くてもと感じた(割りと充分あるけども)。更衣室系は着替えぐらいしかしてないけど、そこでポーズ取らせて写真撮れるのが、好きな人にはドハマりするらしいんでやってみてはどうでしょうか。

こんな人にオススメ
・超ド直球のお色気ゲームが好きな人
・ゲームキャラにに男なんて必要ないぜという人
・女の子の着せ替えをしたい人
・グラフィックは良いに決まっているという人"

												I wrote a blog post a while ago about why I ♥♥♥♥ing hate video games, because this is what it does appeals to like the male fantasy.

ＰＲＯＳ (Will mostly be comparing this one to the previous titles)
+Better gameplay 
+More playable characters
+Harder difficulties are now actually hard
+Animations are more fluid and the models are ＳＯＦＴＥＲ
+ＨＥＡＤＰＡＴＳ
+ＰＬＡＹＡＢＬＥ　ＫＡＧＵＲＡ

ＣＯＮＳ
-Keyboard controls are pretty awkward just like other console ports but a controller would easily solve this
-While I do not mind the repetitive gameplay since this is a musou game, grinding to max the yin, yang, and flash stats can be a huge pain in the ♥♥♥
-Some of the movesets were drastically changed
-Kagura doesn't have a shinobi girls heart mission

As for the story, it's actually enjoyable and the drama is pretty good unlike the previous titles which is mainly about slaying youmas or revenge. Character development can actually be felt here because of the longer dialogues.
And just like Plato once said ""Never trust anyone with less than 2 digits of game time on senrans.""

EDIT: Kissing is actually available in this version. Instructions on the comments thanks to my guy Yamato."

												We can all agree that nobody come to play Senran Kagura for the characters, the writing or the gameplay. Yet the makers have put an incredible ammount of effort into exactly those areas. All of the clevages on the screen have very fun and endearing things to say and some stories can be surprisingly emotional. Be it one holding her pain in just long enough for her mother to die in peace, another realizing that joy in the now is fleeting nd can't last forever or another finally accepting that groping women's boobs is only  statisfying for so long and that there are also butts, legs and bellies to grope (haven't we all been there?)
Personally, I can't wait for someone to make a tool to lower the jiggling a bit and maybe adjust the bust sizes to make the characters more distinct as with the last entry. 
Still, this is a shamefully fun game with a lot of humor, quirk and fanservice."

												The gameplay is actually quite fun and solid,
I am sure it will get repetitive at some point, but so far its still fresh for me.

To the point in which... the excessive fan-service here actually devalues the game.
fan-service is the reason why people buy the game, i am aware of it, but the gameplay is fun as well.

More focus towards the gameplay and making the fan-service implict

This game may even reach a wider audiance even as a niche."

												I'm an idiot for still buying these games. They're not good. They're total mindless button mashers. Every character uses the same combo for everything. XXXYBXXXY. They're awful by any gameplay standard you attempt to measure them by: Brawler, character action, musou.

Oh right, now I remember why, it's right there on the box. The animu tiddies. The waifu cast in this game is somehow even better than Shinovi Versus, if you can believe it. (Well, nobody is better than Yumi...). The crisp, anime art looks absolutely beautiful in action. Everything is so smooth... and soft... and bouncy... There's not a second of this game that isn't gorgeous to look at.

True to series form, there is a lot of plot this time around, and it is about as dumb as you expect. It bounces back and forth from ""Waaah my dead sister is back and I still can't swallow my pride to make up with her."" to... well... Give me some space here.

""I know, let's have a boob grabbing competition!""
""N-nani! Th-that's not right!""
""Oh, are you scared you'll lose?""
""... ngh, I'm no coward! Fine, I accept! Your boobs will fall prey to my fearsome grip!""
(Spoilers you don't actually get to grab boobs it's a normal fight.)

Look, you know why you want Senran Kagura. Everyone knows. I'm honest about it too. It's stupid. There's nothing to the gameplay and almost nothing to the plot. But it's absolutely gorgeous.

And Yumi is the best girl and I love kicking all your other trash waifus asses with her."

												While mainly known for fanservice, the Senran Kagura series generally offers a fun mix of fun gameplay, likeable characters and surprisingly interesting stories. As well as fanservice. Estival Versus is not only a good example of that, as of now it's the pinnacle of the franchise.

The main draw (aside from the obvious) is the hack-and-slash gameplay. The Versus subseries particularly takes elements from Koei's Warriors games, featuring many battles against hordes of weaker enemies, that are mauled, slaughtered and, at times, downright juggled. However, not all of them are completely weak. There are several types of mooks that put up quite a fight and can be pretty dangerous. Especially since they never come alone. This serves well to keep things interesting and prevent these battles from becoming too easy.

However, the focus is still the ""boss fights"" against the main characters, which is the most fun part of the game. While the ordinary enemies have limited possibilities, the bosses, essentially AI players, can do everything you can do (and then some). And with the difficulty being a step-up from SV, they're far from pushovers. Blindly charging and hacking away is rarely a good idea, as they attack quickly and can defend themselves well. At times, a bit too well, as the AI tends to blatantly cheat, which can be pretty frustrating.

When it comes to character selection, EV leaves little to be desired (unless you prefer flat-chested girls, but even those have a little representation) with at least 27 playable characters (with DLC increasing the roster up to 34). While some are of course similar, none are mere clones and everyone has traits that make them play different from everyone else. However, you don't have an entirely free selection. Not only are 3 characters locked at the beginning, the story mode enforces are playable character in every unfinished mission (although all of them can be replayed with every character). This ensures that all of them are properly represented, but it can be pretty frustrating, when you have to play with a character you just can't get a hang of.

Mission-wise, unlike SV (which had different storylines based on different factions) the game mainly features a single linear story. Which can be good (a more unified plot without continuity issues, being able to play every mission with every character independent of faction) or bad (not able to switch to different missions), depending on how you look at it. Aside from that, there are a bunch of character-focused missions that have to be unlocked through the main game. With every (non-DLC) character having 5 such missions, there's quite a lot to play through. DLCs also add several other kinds of side missions.

A mainstay of the series is the Dressing Room, where you can change the outfits the girls wear into battle or fool around with them. The selection is much better than before with the much-needed ability to use every outfit for normal and transformed states, a better color selection for every item, slots for accessories and swimsuits as normal outfits. It also has a Diorama mode, where you can place up to five characters in several poses in a picture. Nothing amazing but a neat feature.

Unlike SV, which was originally Vita-exclusive, EV also came out for PS4 and it shows in the much improved visuals. While the maps aren't anything special (although are pretty nice to look at), even when they're noticeably bigger, the characters really benefit from the upgrade. Not only do they look very accurate to their 2D designs, the graphics do a great job in showing them off in 3D. In a game focused on pretty and busty girls, quite an important point.

The music is pretty nice and good to listen to. However, I feel it's a step-down from SV. And while there is an option to use the SV soundtrack instead, it requires paid DLC.

Unlike what one would expect, I think this game could be suited for people who don't care about fanservice. Not so much for those who outright dislike it, as it's too pervasive. Naturally, people who love fanservice, particular the kind that features big and bouncy breasts, get the best experience.

Senran Kagura Estival Versus is a very good and well-rounded (in more ways than one) hack-and-slash game. It's nothing revolutionary, but it really doesn't need to be, it just needs to offer lots of fun and it does that well. And if you like a good dose of T&A (mostly T) with your ninja action game, you can't do much wrong with it."

												My first hour with Estival Versus was met with nothing but frustration. Between wrestling with the keybindings, giving up on the display settings, fuming at how typically Japanese the sloppy PC port is and gritting my teeth at the slower combat mechanics compared to its prodecessor, I wondered if they learned anything at all from Shinovi Versus.

The linear story progression forces you to sit through tutorials and you'll have to use characters you dislike every now and then (Mirai, how I loathe thee with a passion). Similar games like Samurai Warriors or Sengoku Basara has a lot more freedom of choice and lets you go at your own pace.

On top of all that are the DLCs which you must purchase separately. After the full package that is Shinovi Versus, this leaves a bit of a sour taste.

Once you get over all that downsides, find some workarounds and actually start fighting though, it's pure unadulterated bahonkas. Having long recovery times after combo and dashes means taking more deliberation in your actions, making combat a little more thoughtful than spamming dash-cancels to eternity and beyond like its prodecessor.

Visually there's no complaints here. It's a big and vibrant step-up from Shinovi Versus. Better shading, anisotropic filter and cleaner outlines. Helps that all the girls are cute badasses too.

Estival Versus is still not for everyone. It's grindy, repetitive and is downright unashamed of nudity and fanservice. If you're okay with that though, you will feel right at home here.

11/10 Would pursue this Lu Bu"

Aside from the fanservice, the gameplay is smooth and works well. Fighting is harder than in Shinovi Versus since your character needs some time to regain balance but it makes for different style of play.

Originally released in Japan for the Playstation 4 and Playstation Vita on March 26 2015 with North American and European releases following on March 15 and March 18 2016 respectively, we have Senran Kagura: Estival Versus. What you’re seeing here is the PC version of the game which was released on March 17 2017 and for transparency, I was given a copy of this game via a PR network. Developed by Tamsoft and published by Marvelous in Japan and Europe with XSEED handling the game in North America, Senran Kagura: Estival Versus is the seventh game in the Senran Kagura series and the fifth game to be released in English. The eighth game Senran Kagura: Peach Beach Splash was released for Playstation 4 in Japan on March 16 2017 and I’ll be covering that game in a future review. 

In Estival Versus, our four teams of shinobi get transported to a mysterious island by Sayuri, the grandmother of Asuka, the leader of Hanzo for the Kagura Millennium Festival where dead shinobi with regrets are temporarily brought over to the world of the living where they can be laid to rest. As well as that, our four teams as well as the overseers of the festival; the Mikagura sisters are to participate in the Shinobi Bon Dance, a battle royale of sorts where each team must destroy platforms belonging to the other teams with the reward being the road opening up to the status of Kagura, the highest status in the Shinobi World. On top of that, you’ll also get the light hearted humour and slice of life moments in between, but is the game any good? Find out in…

[THE GOOD]

I found the gameplay of Estival Versus is quite an improvement over Shinovi Versus. The game includes a few new elements such as wall running and attacks as well as Fusion Aerial Raves where if you’re playing a mission with a teammate, you can perform a combination attack of sorts. You can also pick up bomb shells with do various things such as freezing or paralysing the opponent to even summoning grunts or a ridable mech for you to deal more damage with which is pretty fun. Another thing introduced to the game are Creative Finishers where if your opponent is defeated near certain areas (reflected by a signpost with an exclamation mark on it), they fall into the trap in that area whilst losing all their clothes. While some are a little over the top, this is to be expected in a Senran Kagura game and I feel it adds to the charm. However in comparison to Shinovi Versus, the gameplay does feel a bit slower so I wouldn’t be expecting a lot of fast paced gameplay.

I quite enjoyed the Shinobi Girls Heart Missions that I unlocked over the course of the game. In certain levels you’ll find festival platforms that you need to destroy. Some of these platforms can be a bit out of the way or hidden and some require you to think outside the box on how to reach them. Once a certain amount of them have been destroyed you’ll start unlocking Shinobi Girls Heart Missions which are 5 stages where you play as a certain character. These missions also tell a small story whether it’s Miyabi wanting everyone to call her a hunk or Asuka’s grandfather switching bodies with her, the missions act as a small slice of life tales to the game, complete with a CG for the ending.

Diorama mode is a returning feature I also enjoyed too. Returning from Senran Kagura 2: Deep Crimson on the 3DS, and as an expansion of the Dressing Room mode of the original, the Diorama mode allows you to dress up characters and have them pose in backgrounds. The costumes you give the characters can also be used in battle too so feel free to experiment around and customize the girls to your liking.

The game also introduces a bunch of characters with a number of them being DLC. Returning characters include Rin and Daidouji who were originally introduced through a free update. New characters introduced include Naraku and True Kagura who first appeared in Senran Kagura 2: Deep Crimson as well as the shopkeeper and member of Hanzo Academy Ayame making their first playable appearance (New Wave doesn’t count). The game also features crossover characters such as Ayane from the Dead or Alive series and most notable, three characters from Ikkitousen. Originally due to licencing issues the Ikkitousen girls weren’t available, but after some negotiations, they were allowed in, however, they’re identified by the Three Kingdoms hero they represent. Each character I’ve found DLC or not also plays differently so it’s easy enough to pick a character that you’ll work well with. But, all’s not well with the game so with that we’ll move onto…

[THE BAD]

While the game has you play through as certain Shinobi, the one I felt was most left out of a playable role was Homura the leader of her Crimson Squad having the only playable story role in a Tutorial mission. While the game has you playing as just about every character at least twice, I feel that out of the team leaders, Homura really gets shafted for playable roles. On the plus side, you can replay completed missions as any character and Homura does get a Shinobi Girls Heart series of missions, but I feel that she’s a little unrepresented in this instalment.

The game from my understanding is a little bit on the buggy side as well. While I have come across bugs in which my game’s crashed or I’ve been forced to quit the game through ALT + F4, I’ve been one of the luckier ones, as I’ve heard from some folks playing the game that they’ve been forced to quit the game as early as the tutorial missions. Hopefully though the game does get patched soon so people don’t have to put up with this.

I also felt that the story was all over the place and some of the translation changes didn’t make much sense. While it does take a much more serious turn near the end, I felt that a lot of the story was padded with filler content and situations if you excuse the pun. One of them for instance has Miyabi the leader of the revived Hebijo group attacking the Mikagura Sisters over Sugar and Soy sauce to make an Egg Rice bowl with her mother and one that bugged me was where Shiki, one of the Gessen members was, according to the translation learning French when in the original and clearly in the dialogue it’s English. Asides from that, I don’t really have much else to complain about so it’s now time I give…

[THE OPINION]

Senran Kagura: Estival Versus, bugs aside is a fun game that people will either like or hate. Under the gratuitous fan-service, I’ve found the game does have a more serious outlook and explores themes around reuniting with dead loved ones while throwing in the trademark humour the series has since been well known for. If fan-service is your thing and if you’re a fan of the series, I’d say pick the game up. For the additional characters and missions, you’ll be paying out the ♥♥♥ in DLC. I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing the game and I’m looking forward to what the series has in store for the future after Peach Beach Splash."

												 Target Audience:   Action Gamers Who Want Some Visual Flair. Ok, who like boobs, let's just put it bluntly.

 Summary:   
 Please note: The majority of play time here was spent with testing PC performance, as reviewer has already reviewed the gameplay/majority of game on the PS4
A good but not great port of a solid action game that won't change the genre, but will be a nice little experience. You should know what you get out of the Senran Kagura franchise: busty ninjas, action gameplay, and a little bit of cheese. Estival Versus for the most part delivers that: although there are some hiccups in this formula. The girls and their new mission sometimes don't match up in their characters: as the new format is a little more loose then other iterations. With that said, the humor is still here, and can lead to some hilarious moments, and there's more to then their obvious “assets” to their characters, especially with the family connections that develop in this game..

You're here for the visuals and the gameplay, and the PC port delivers a locked 60 FPS with no drops. The visuals and the presentation work rather well, with emphasis on animation and character movement working great for the lovely ladies here. And while the game play is repetitive, it's the difference in characters and how they play that help the variety keep the game going without it being too boring. While the story mode has you play everyone, you'll find a couple of characters you really love, and will go back and play levels trying to find platforms and get all the game has to offer. And of course finding the little animations of when you hit a girl into the environment, and they end up interacting with the world (which is always hilarious). 

It's a solid but not spectacular game. Good for some laughs, but if you're looking for the pinnacle of gameplay in the genre: it's not here. It's like the girls themselves, solid, having a nice look to them, but you question if you really want them to do an assassination job.

			XSEED usually doesn't hold back on it's fan service, and Senran Kagura: Estival Versus is no exception. But, there's a big question: does it also bring the Gameplay?		
	


 Lists: 
Positives:
 Each character is reasonably unique in implementation, leading to some reasonably different play styles. You'll pick up certain favorites, but I don't feel like a lot of them are copies of each other.
 The visuals are lovely, and yes, of course that's a reference to the girls as well. Animation is crisp, and the physics engine works well. God I feel dirty writing that.
 Humor works on the gag comedy level. It's not the most intelligent of writing, but given the material, it doesn't have to be. 
 Animations work well for the core material in question. Obviously having a girls clothes fly off is part what I'm talking about, but the battle animations and how they attack enemies over and over again also works rather nicely. 
 Colorful environment art and really nice to look at coloring work on the girls. High quality, and even at lower resolutions, it still looks lovely.
 Up to 4 K resolution, and decent options in terms of PC options. At least for a console port game.
 It may seem awkward at first, but controls work well for the battle type chosen here, especially for the controller. 
 For once, I actually like dressing up my characters in funny outfits and really taking advantage of that in game. It doesn't feel like a chore. Yes, I'm playing fashion model. I don't care. It's fun. 
 And there's actually some rather touching moments given the games events. Some of them may come down to things that people would consider “cheesy”, but given these characters, I really believe that some of them work. And you do buy some of the difficulty that some of these characters will end up going through.
 Difficulties are well implemented, although the default difficulty being easy is a little meh. 
 Higher difficulties actually does make you have to take a step back against the AI and actually use that pesky dodge and block button. Which is nice to see. 
 Performance is locked at 60 FPS, but it also never drops. Ever. Regardless of if 100 enemies are on the screen, and you're doing a super attack. While I would have loved for it to be unlocked (and given the community I wouldn't be surprised if they find a way to do that), it's acceptable for the default PC port performance.
Negatives:
 Series veterans will note that some of the characters don't come off as normally as they would in the entire series. Some of them will make you pause even if you don't, cause given the character they've built, it just doesn't seem like them.
 The default PC controls are confusing to say the least. With K being a confirmation button, and the default camera controls being on the numpad, it makes absolutely no sense. You've got bindable keys, but frankly, I'm still wondering who made the default controls, they make no sense..
 There is an element of repetition over the course of the gameplay, and that's not going away. They've got some elements in terms of variety in destroy platforms and facing different enemy heroes, but frankly, you'll be defeating things the same way over and over again, and you may start to get bored over time if you're not used to this type of game.
 If you're expecting Musou gameplay, while the action here, the strategy is not in terms of location based gameplay. 
 There's RPG elements here to build characters....but I honestly feel like it could have been thrown out and I'd be none the wiser. 
 Wanted a tiny more variety in the default foot soldiers in terms of their combat style. Sure, you get some, but later in the game I found myself really ignoring them and going for the other heroes. 
 Do wish there was one more system to the gameplay to really take the variety to the next level. I felt like if they added this, it would put the game on a whole different platform.
 There's a lot of little things that bother me and annoy me in this game. Things like the difficulty in the story mode always defaulting to easy, even if the last levels I beat were on normal."

												I have probably put in 100+ hours on my Vita, but this version is a PS4 port. So far it is completely stable, just like their port of older games. If you like Dynasty Warriors (I am a massive fan of that gameplay), and appreciate a bit of fan service, you will find your holy grail here, complete with 4K and 60fps support. Embrace the 3D Anime Waifu action!

												Quick review coming through. I'll compare it with its previous installment, so if you are new to the series, i would recommend other reviews that go into depth about what the game is about.

Pros:

-More  oppai  Senran Kagura. The game has a huge roster of characters to play as, bigger than ever. And this time, you can replay any stage as any character no matter the school. And character customization got even more ridiculous, being able to wear whatever you want, whenever you want (Pre/Transformation).

-Combat is more fluid than in SV, although, not as fast. But it sure feels more rewarding, and in higher difficulties, smashing buttons won't do you any good. That said, there's 3 difficulties so if you felt in SV like combat isn't your cup of tea but enjoyed the characters/bizarre situations, now is easier than ever to do so. Also, Hard is more challenging than in SV, something I appreciate.

-The port is superb. It runs flawlessly even on toasters, not a single FPS drop. Graphic settings are almost barebones but, overall, I can't complain seeing how well it runs. Also so far, not a single bug/CTD.

-More online game modes (Including ""co-op""). And the game can support up to 10 players in MP. It also comes with a great game browser. Sadly, atm, there's not many matches going on but I hope that soon enough, once people are done with the story or in future sales, the number increases. 

-More content than ever. You're gonna be entertained for quite some time. The main story is quite interesting, although I miss the rivalry from SV to spice things up between schools.

-Better production values. The addition of dynamic camera angles and the fluid animations during conversations make them feel more natural. There's also anime cutscenes, and only a few situations are explained using those infamous static backgrounds.

And now, to my main and only con:

-The DLC policy. With SV we got all the DLCs included in the package after being released 2 years later. In this case, we had to also wait for its release on PC (It was released 2 years ago in JP, but one after EU/NA release) but this time, we have to pay full price for all of them.

I can understand having to pay for the character DLCs that are released alongside the PC version. But having to pay (full price) for content that is more than a year old in other platforms in a re-release, is a no-no to me. Also the publisher wasn't clear at all the previous week before release about the content that would be included in the package. Thankfully, most DLCs are cosmetic and there's only a couple worth your time.

All that said, Estival Versus is a vastly improvement over SV in almost every possible way. If you enjoyed SV, this is a no brainer."

												If your game is lagging, it might be defaulted using integrated graphic card. Change it in your respective card setting (in my case it's Nvidia Control Panel). I switched from Intel integrated to my GT930M and every battle goes smoothly.

As for the game itself, ESTIVAL VERSUS is huge improvement from its predecessor. Use of better models, improvement for nearly every features, and of course larger roster of characters to play. Quality port reassured.
Fully supporting my favorite illustrator Yaegashi Nan.

Thank you for porting ESTIVAL VERSUS to its fullest!"

+ The gameplay is surprisingly fun. It's similar to the Dynasty Warriors series where you pull off various combos while fighting through hundreds of enemies. 
+ TONS of characters each with their own weapons, special abilities, and unique personalities.
+ Lengthly cutscenes with humerous dialogue
+ Very sexually teasing as there's a lot of playful nudity as you transform to different outfits, and tear off enemy clothing.
+ Visually the game looks amazing, very vibrant with a great anime style.
+ Great soundtrack

- The missions are a bit too reptitive after a while, and essentially have you doing the same thing with a different character each time. 
- Personally I felt like there was a bit too much dialogue after each mission. You'll likely be reading more than actually playing the game. Along with that it seems like a lot of the scenes are somewhat random and a bit silly. Some scenes are just an image with text overlayed on top which felt a bit lazy."
