												This game is actually better than I thought it'd be. In my opinion, it's actually a good game. Despite the occasional freezing (2 that fixed themselves in approximately 5 hours straight of playing) the game runs pretty smooth. 7.5/10 (only issue is it's a bit repetitive, but im only at the beginning so who knows)."

												Awwww mates, this game gets me more erect than the sex scenes in God Of War. Apart from typical little glitches that ♥♥♥♥ you off that ubisoft are known for and are fixable through minor updates, this game is just full of so much IMMERSION. You ever remember that first Porn magazine you found in your best mates room and kept for years and years? This is that game. It's more beautiful than your ex girlfriends Youngest Auntie.

Buy this game, Nerds."

												Great world, decent AI, Nice variety of ways to engage, Jokes so bad they are good, the freedom is great, and great customization of your gun and character, I also love the stealth mechanics, it can be a challanging game (I'm on advanced so I'm not sure about normal but advanced isn't too much), they also made it so your AI squad will spot the targets on your HUD.. Thank god.. This game isn't for everybody as my friends are torn between ones who love it and ones who don't really enjoy playing it. Be sure to read reviews and watch some videos or something before you buy it, you know."

												What do I say about this game...... If you don't have it pick it up NOW!!!!!! The Graphics are amazing, glad Ubisoft didn't pull another downgrade on us. The Story so far is really detailed as hell. Yes, they are a few bugs here and there but easily fix if you know what to do. A lot of people complain about the bad FPS well the way I fixed that (Playing on 4K) is set off vsync and turn on FPS Limited to 60. That will fix most issues. Only thing I can complain about is the ""Physics of vehicles"" other then that the game is one of the best games I've had a chance to play in a while.. If you haven't or are still thinking about getting do it now, the game is what we was promised and IMO it lived up to the hyped."

												So I won't beat a dead horse and go listing pro's and con's, you can see pleanty of that on these boards.

Short version--I liked it!  Plays great with single player (little AI buddies are a bit odd at times) and it really shines with a friend or two.

If you like open world games with a military flavoring then I'd recommend it."

												Great game with good optimization. You need a higher end GPU (Like an RX 480 or above),  but you can make by with an older or worse CPU (like mine, which is a 9 year old Phenom II x4 945). I run at custom (4300 mb of vram, most ultra stuff with some things turned off- I played around with it). I recommended this if your looking for a fun new tactical shooter."

			Review: Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Wildlands is an open world third person shooter playable in single player with AI companions, or in online co-op.		
	

TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!
Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands is an open world third person shooter playable in single player with AI companions, or in online co-op.

You and up to three other players or friendly AIs are free to explore the large open world of Bolivia. You play as a member of the ghost recon team sent into Bolivia by the CIA to find intel, locate cartel members, and dismantle the entire organization one section at a time. There are some interesting main story missions, but for the most part, the main plot and the characters are not all that memorable.

The core of the gameplay revolves around completing missions. Combat plays a huge role in the vast majority of these missions. The combat can be approached stealthily or you can just run in guns blazing and start blasting enemies to bits with various weapons or explosives.

If you want to ghost missions, synchronizing kills with your allies is an absolutely necessary, and effective tactic. Attempting to fully ghost the game with all HUD indicators turned off makes Wildlands feel like a completely different (and more challenging game). I hated being spammed with notifications and prompts all the time, so I’m very glad that there are HUD options available. I turned most indicators off, but I did keep some on to help keep tabs on enemy movement. Spotting enemies using a drone or binoculars is extremely helpful, and I used the drone quite often.

Leveling up your character requires you to kill enemies, complete main missions, side objectives, or find collectibles. In addition to earning skill points by leveling up or finding them in the world, you also need to collect resources that are earned from completing rebel side missions or gathering resource items to learn any new skills.

The online co-op is definitely more enjoyable than single player. Public matchmaking is available, but I prefer playing with friends and communicating over voice chat. Inviting friends to join you, or just dropping in to their games is easy, and the peer-to-peer connections work fine. It’s also nice that players can spawn on allies in co-op if their revive timer runs out instead of having to restart the mission like in single player.

Playing single player with the three friendly AIs isn’t too bad, but the AI could use some improvement. They weren’t really a burden, and they didn’t get me killed or anything. At times they felt completely useless though, and didn’t offer me much in the way of cover support. They also revive you with enemies standing right next to them. It was a bit annoying to be revived and instantly shot at again. The AI companions don’t stay with you very well, but at least they teleport to you anytime you get in a vehicle.

Pros:good variety of other missions types, including spy-like infiltration, car chases, killing, kidnapping, interrogating targets, hijacking vehicles, and defending objectives, etc.
easily accessible weapon loadout, and attachments the can accomadate different playstyles (i.e. grenades, and grenade launchers are great for on the move, or you can also take a more tactical approach by setting up traps using mines and C4, and creating noise distractions to lure enemies into them)
Bolivia is quite large, and there is a lot of content; there are tons of main story missions, sidequests, and collectibles
character progression occurs at a reasonable pace
character and weapon customization is excellent, and there are plenty of cosmetics to discover
environments look good; the provinces with different structures and ecozones are a nice change in scenery
music during the gameplay is decent, sound effects are great; the voice acting is mostly good, but occasionally there is too much talking
controls are fully customizable, and there is full controller support
Cons:some mission types can start feeling repetitive (i.e. collecting intel)
annoying music and announcers on the radio may make you wish there was a way to permanently disable radio option
(nitpick) the mountainous terrain often makes for lengthy driving route if you plan to stick to the roads; also, there’s too much travelling, and you can’t toggle vehicles into first person view (on a side note: I suck at driving, and prefer to drive as little as possible)
(nitpick) some texture popping, and some areas that look very bland and other areas that look like more of the same
(nitpick) performance isn’t perfect, and the game could use better optimization (using Win10, i7-6700k, GTX1070, 32GB RAM using custom settings somewhere between very high and ultra typically, maintained above 60fps, but periodically when driving there were noticeable, but brief hiccups in performance)
(nitpick) microtransactions are available to unlock cosmetics, or weapons and attachments immediately, or for purchasing xp boosts to level 50% quicker (you can find the weapons in game, and leveling faster without having enough resources from doing side objectives isn’t that helpful; these microtransactions are completely unnecessary, but their mere presence along with the season pass is bound to irritate some people)
I played entirely with the mouse and keyboard, but I would have really preferred a controller for driving and flying. The vehicle controls feel a bit wonky with the keyboard: sometimes it felt almost too sensitive, and different vehicles took a bit of getting used to. The plane and helicopter controls seem simplified compared to other games like GTA or BF. I find it easier to fly in Wildlands, but flying does feel kind of clunky.

After fully completing the main story missions for any 2 of the 4 cartel operations, you can finish the main story and see the ending. It took me roughly 17 hours to do so in single player, and that was with gathering any convenient collectibles, but skipping almost all of the side missions. There is still a ton of stuff to complete including half the story missions, just about all the side missions, and a whole lot of collectibles. Even though I saw the ending, I intend to continue playing more missions in co-op.

Conclusion:Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands has a whole lot of content to keep you busy. There is a good variety of mission types available, but even then, some of the missions and constant travelling may feel repetitive after a while. Overall though, it’s a decent game. The single player is fine, but playing online co-op is the best way to play it, since there’s even more fun to be had with friends.

												I’m gonna through my hat in the ring and just say this. Were aware that this isn’t a “Typical stealth tactical game"" like that of Splinter Cell (which I played back in the days I wasn’t a PC Gamer) or Metal gear solid. But for some to say the game is bad on PC is an understatement. For start the graphics alone are enough to make one play the game, with a draw distance that holds detail at over 5km is a feat in technological achievement on its own. I mean the shots that me and my friends pull off in the beta were stunning. That isn’t saying that it’s impossible to not pull of the total stealth zones without being detected, it’s just seems like the game wants you to do the arcade/stealth aspect. I’m just going to say this, if you plan to go stealth, HAVE A PLAN AND GOOD RELIABLE FRIENDS. If not one slip up will cost you going stealth and then turning into a balls to the walls gun shoot out (god damn is unidad annoying when it gets to that point)

Now is this game for single player, no and I wouldn’t recommend it for just that (but I don’t mean that Single player is bad I’m just saying that’s not what the game was designed for), but with a group of friends the possibilities are endless. And I will say Ubisoft hit the nail on that alone. Sure by the reviews from the beta, tagging enemies with a drone makes it easier but this is the 21st century. We’re using drones to track people in Iraq and I don’t see an issue with a game that is actually up to date with drone’s usages so far (quad copters is what I’m referring to). Also I found it much easier to be stealthy and distract enemies much like that with the camera from Splinter Cell’s conviction.

Many other reviews from the beta section of the game were in response to camera issues and control issues. Camera issues and all the wonky controls are just something that is unique to each game. GTA had them, Red dead redemption had them, and nearly all games have some camera issues of some sort. My saying is either get used to them or deal with it, or if it’s that big of a deal then just stop playing the game and try to get a refund. I mean really control that you can even bind and setup custom controls to your keyboard are a thing these days. Take the time to set them up if it bothers you that bad. I tend to set the controls similar to that of Fallouts controls, but this is because I’m familiar with that games controls and I bet you can do the same for a game similar to your gaming preferences.

I will also say this, the game takes a demanding PC to run at high. Latency issues with players are an issue, but knowing from running gaming servers this takes time to weed out as some changes to game mechanics and even missions can cause uncontrollable lag. I don’t expect the launch to be 100% bug free but it’s not gonna be as bad as when GTA V Online released back in 2013. But if you want to run the game at high or ultra, then take in to consideration if your setup will handle to load. I know the minimum specs are for a system that is of late 2011, but that’s the minimum specs to just play the game and not give a damn about graphics. If you want to check my specs on my profile feel free to, but I ran this game on my main PC and was able to average 57 fps on high. Not bad at all, but maybe with a GTX 1070 and the new Ryzen AMD or Intel i7 series, I could pull that off with an Ultra graphics with possibly 60+ FPS.

That being said here’s what I think and what people should take into consideration. If you want a game that you and your friends could play in Open-world, Co-op missions and want stunning graphics that you’re capable of running on a great (and I mean like $800-$1000 machines here) machine, then get the game. If you’re not able to meet that then I can say you'll be disappointed like many of the reviewers giving the beta a bad review based upon 1.5 hours of gameplay and assumptions from previous games.

If I had to give it a score I’d give it an 8.5/10, and if Ubisoft continues support (much like it does for the division) then I’ll rate it a 9/10. Yes Ubisoft has made screw ups in the past, but with the release of wildlands I can only hope the company continues to make games as good, if not better than wildlands in the future. And if they can I can see the community possibly forgiving them for the day when Ubisoft made games that were buggy as hell.

Time in beta: 10.5 hrs
Time in GR:Wildlands: well have to wait and see after the first 30 hours"

												I love this game.

This game is my favourite game right now because of the open world atmosphere, the map size and just ♥♥♥♥ing around with friends.

Now, the story in this game isn't very good. It doesn't have any emotional bond or hatered towards characters and you never get any backstory of any characters other than El Sueno in the first cutscene of the game.

But the bugs in this game and the missions you can do and the basic functions of the game make playing this the best game ever. There isn't any paid content that gives you a PvP (for when it's released) boost, like Ubisoft does, unless you count weapon and attachment packs which can all be unlocked in the game.

Anyways, I give this a thumbs up, good work Ubisoft."

												Lots of fun solo, haven't really tried with people yet. Just amazing to look at and Ansel images are insane in detail. The game plays well, and although repetative, there's enough diversity in the locations and your approaches that I don't seem to get tired of it. Frame rate also needs improvement. Only getting about 45-60FPS on ultra with GTX1080/i7-7700k at 1440p. Had better frame rate on beta and also controller support... there's something odd going on right now with that.

The AI sucks a bit still and is pretty dumb sometimes, which I hope UBI works on and the driving although fun, has little to no concesquences when you when you decide to defy physics. You can pretty much drive up or down anything, off cliffs, etc and there's no real damage. That would be nice to improve as well.

The one thing completely lacking......in ""Wildlands"" is .... well.... wildlife.... There's a few birds here or there, a couple other mammals in select areas, but you can run km's through mountains, forests, etc and not run into a single animal. Immersion ruined ;)

Good:

-Fun gameplay
-Lots of weapons and accessories
-Drop dead gorgeous graphics
-Very large environment

Bad:

-AI is slow (even your own AI squad)
-Environment can feel empty at times
-Physics are laughable
-Frame rates need working on"

												Maybe the best map i have seen in games. Big, detailed and live. Plus great graphics, perfect sounds, fluid gameplay and good atmosphere: Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands is one of the best games even it is an Ubisoft product. Car and aircraft physics are the biggest cons with some other minors.

-Is it playable solo?
-Absolutely. You can command your crew and also rebels to play tactical style. It works in most situations. Of course playing with friends is better but if you  have to play solo, this game is perfect for you. I strongly recommend you to play SLOW. Dont rush anything, think before you act, command AI, watch videos, read intels, spend time in villages and cities, watch the enviroment, follow the story. Otherwise the game will be a pain for you. Personally i have finished 1/10 of the game in 15 hours. That speed appear to be my sweet point to get the most fun. Have fun!"

												Imagine the division, now Imagine GTA.  Throw in a little Rainbow 6 and CS:GO and you've essentially got this game.  Really like a Just Cause 2 on Steroids (minus the graple)

Countless guns, insane customization ability, many skins (though non tradeable if that matters), and a fun story.

Combined with the ability to team up with up to 3 others, this game is pretty great.  Now Don't get me wrong, the driving mechanics are not the prettiest, but this isn't GTA.  The game has better graphics than the division (and if you have the game at 1440p Ultra, you better be prepared - 2 1080 FTWs in SLI is averaging me around 70 FPS, though Better performance could probably be easily obtained).  Guns are extreamly detailed, and take cosmetic damage as you use them which you have the option to keep or remove.  Characters are able to be made essentially how ever you want them, and countless stitchable emblems are avialable for use.  

Pros:
Countless Guns
Amazing Customization (Use & Cosmetic)
Driving + Flying + Boating
Good Story
Functioning (and easy to use) multiplayer
Fast Load Time
Great Graphics

Cons:
Graphically Demanding (though easily avoidable)
Driving isn't the smoothest process
Cars take damage fast (cosmetic)

Over all, as I've come to expect with Tom Clancy games, the graphics are great, and the game play is pretty good as well.  A good story (much more elaborate than The Division's in terms of content quantity).

All the game is missing (unless its there and I can't see it) is PvP"

												Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands has to be one of my most current now recommended Tom Clancy labeled games since Splinter Cell Blacklist. It has to be the most nailed down to a T of a game I've been looking for. I was looking for a game kind of like Arma, but with more of a open world with random encounters and has a story to it, as well as it being a co-op or lone wolf feel.

Pros:
Glorious banter with friends.
Being able to shoot long distances with good bullet physics.
Decent Ai that also has good convos with each other.
Pretty cool random events such as: Supply Transports, Random helicopters flying over and them attacking the player/s.

Cons:
The occasional game freeze to load up more of the map. (for me I don't mind it.)
The chat for typing between people is a bit dodgy, such as you could be typing and it won't send and it would glitch and would spam letters instead of moving.
The stupid civs just running you over because they cannot drive for ♥♥♥♥.

Conclusion:
Overall, I have enjoyed the game and there is so much more to do because there is multiple things you can do other than just completing the story missions, infact I still have few more to do as I am writing this at roughly 60ish hours in game.
As well as playing it again with a mate or two really inpacts more of enjoyment rather than solo and rushing everything."

												I've enjoyed playing so far. just doing single player with AI, having no real issues with the AI like others. Just be patient, don't go all call of duty on this game. Learn the mechanics and gameplay. Slow and methodical killing and the AI is fine. Give them orders to open fire and they do fine. Sync shots are a lot of fun once you unlock more of them (only 1 to start). 

Love love love the huge open beautiful world, hours will blink bye before you know it.

A couple bugs when you try to create another character (my 2nd character was covered by the menu) and not being able to back out of the character creation screen, but that's all I've encountered. No loading issues, no crashing issues, no rendering issues. 

Overall fun so far and enjoying myself with the game."

												Really fun open world millitary shooter. Lots of bugs and glitches but thats expected for a game of this size still in the first week of its release (although it would be nice if they can be fixed asap because some bugs are game breaking) luckily the game autosaves pretty well so you don't lose progress. Game is also a little repetative but it's fun so doesn't really bother me. Anyway, the game has a huge map with different terrains, lots of missions and side missions, graphics are amazing, and co-op can be fun if you're playing with friends. Vehicle controls are a little weird but easy to get used to. This game really reminds me of the Just Cause series, so if you're into that game you will defiantly like this one.

												Ghost Recon : Wildlands is a fantastic co-op game. I think that's the most important thing to put out there, right off the bat. Will you have fun solo? Sure. Just not as much as you would with a friend, not nearly as much. 
GRW is essentially a 40 hour work week friendly co op game - you probably won't miss much by not paying attention to the story, and you don't have to play for hours and hours to get a firm grasp on the mechanics of the game. I don't mean this in a bad way, it's great for me as I constantly work and attend classes, I don't have as much time for gaming as I used to. However, for the player looking for that Tom Clancy experience that we got back in the day from the likes of Rogue Spear, Island Thunder, and Chaos Theory - that's gone. This is a fantastic game - it's just not as solemn and realistic as the TC titles used to be. 
As far as performance goes, this game doesn't run amazingly or poorly. With a GTX 1060 6gb, 8gb of RAM, an i5 7500 @ 3.4, and a 144hz monitor, this game looks great and doesn't stumble on itself too much with a mixture of high / ultra settings. 
Overall, if you're looking for a slightly tactical shooter to scratch your co-op itch, you're in the right place. This game does a great job of being easily accessible to most everyone, making it pretty easy to find a friend to head out into Bolivia with and kick some Santa Blanca butt. If you're seeking more than a great co-op experience, I might skip this one."

												Got real bored of this game real quick.

Pros
-Great concept, I love the idea of hunting down the different leaders of the cartel
-Great customization
-Good graphics

Cons
-Gameplay is repetitve and gets boring quick
-Everything on the map looks the same. You have your different regions that look different enivornmentally but other than that nothing really stands out.

Conclusion:
It is not a terrible game and many people will like it but to me it got boring real quick. It had a good impression at first and I love the concept but the game itself doesn't excite me."

												Ubisoft didn't fail outright and the game is rather fun. Like they always do though, they made a good game that needs some serious polishing/patching.

CONS:
-The vehicle physics are whack and none of them are fun to drive.
-The game is somehow really pretty and yet some of the textures are straight out of NBA Live 2000 (they suck).
-When you switch reticle types in the red dot that shows the reticle selection knob ON the physical item, the nob doesn't switch position when the reticle does. I know this is small, but a game about details that features so many small items from the real gun world, this is important.
-Shallow non-cutscene dialogue. The PCC and NPC dialogue is like 2 total lines that are repeated over and over. Get ready for a ""shitballs"" every 9 seconds.

PROS:
-Bullet drop.
-Sexy sound effects.
-Lots of guns and customization.
-You aren't forced into spending money on in-game items.
-It's hella mad fun to play this with your pals."

												like other reviewers have stated, a new release should not really be weighed exclusively on its performance issues at launch, so my reccomendation comes based on the following.


1. game looks nice, and the world is very big, If you are one of the people that is satisfied with the game play, you are going to get a LOT for your initial investment.
2. a lot of immersion, customizations, skills and stuff to keep you pushing to stregthen your character. TONS of weapons and upgrades, (although im pretty sure you could pass any mission with the start up kit).
3. switching between solo and co-op play is easy, and both sides are equally fun to me. its a pretty good challenge to put the game on max difficulty and try to solo the story missions. its also pretty rad to get into a group and just wreck havoc on everything.


I have seen people crying about the driving, but its no where near as bad as watch dogs 2 or any of the mafia games. it may not quite have the physics dialed in like GTA5, but it works. plus some vehicles have guns, and I actually like the helicopters...

when approaching an outpost , you need to be careful which side you come in from. If there are cliffs ringing the area, you almost always have to approach from another angle , because the climbing is pretty much useless other than small hops and low ledge pull ups. This is one of my only complaints. I'm pretty sure these elite spec op dudes could find more routes up these rocky areas, at least establish some ropes or climbing anchors like other games, so you don't spend 10 minutes skirting a hilltop outpost looking for a way in. 

Ive seen this game compared to the division, and i can draw the same comparisons only asthetically. In the division, the enemies are damage sponges, where a well placed headshot only pulls the NPC. In this game , your aim actually matters, and headshots on normal enemies are one shot kills.

the tactical and stealth mechanics are pretty light, dont expect AI on the level of Dishonored2, but that said, on the max difficulty the bots are pretty nasty. they notice fallen commrades and go on hunt mode, and their aim is ....well ...bot like. this can make for either frustrating or rewarding gameplay, depending on your personal level of patience and willingness to watch and plan. in the end if the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, you can go loud, and even be revived once pre battle by your team mates, if it goes really sideways.


the voice acting is pretty meh, but ive seen a lot worse in AAA titles.

in this day and age , gamers are ever critical of new games, so make sure you are reading into reviews for the things that are important to you, rather than just going by the ratio of good to bad reviews. very few games hit the mark on every box, but this game hits enough of them for me to enjoy it and give it the thumbs up."

												This is a fantastic game! It is a third person, open world shooter. I would liken this game to the likes of GTA V and classic Ghost Recon games with a blend of Far Cry and Splinter Cell splashed in. The game looks amazing and it offers more differences in terrain than any open world game I have played, including GTA V. It has mountains, desert, snow, forest, jungle, farmlands, flooded plains and a huge flat white salt lake bed,  all of which are found across the varied and vast regions within this game. Graphics are superb. It's a classic open world Ubisoft game.It does have that typical open world Ubisoft gameplay of go get this, go collect that and go explore this and the game has had some critique over this. However, it encourages players to explore the vastness of this world and find some nice little hidden gems along he way and some comical storylines. I wouldn't expect a Ubisoft game to be any different. Some of the side missions can be repetitive, however they are still different in their own way. The main story is ok and you can attack the main story in any order you like. It's great to play with mates as well as solo. Some of the mechanics could be a bit better and I still have not worked out how to effectively use a helicopter in combat!! It seems impossible to control. But overall, it's solid and would highly recommend this game to anyone that likes open world and something different."

												At fisrt i thought oh no another open world game from ubisoftt, but then I started playing a bit just to see how the gameplay feels like, and its actually farely decent, they still have much work to put in regarding vehicle controls, but otherwise everything is great, you get tons of tweaks for the graphic settings, the game even lets you run benchmark for your own custom graphic options, and speaking of customization, holy ♥♥♥♥ does this game have it, obviously you dont get crazy character customizations option like an elderscroll game, but the amount of clothes, gears, gun parts you can tweak to your liking is absolutely fantastic.

I recommend this game to people who likes open world and third person shooters, i dont recommend this game to people who wants a great story or FPS fans, it's really different from what you might expect, but overall i have a blast playing it."

												Really fun open world millitary shooter. Lots of bugs and glitches but thats expected for a game of this size still in the first week of its release (although it would be nice if they can be fixed asap because some bugs are game breaking) luckily the game autosaves pretty well so you don't lose progress. Game is also a little repetative but it's fun so doesn't really bother me. Anyway, the game has a huge map with different terrains, lots of missions and side missions, graphics are amazing, and co-op can be fun if you're playing with friends. Vehicle controls are a little weird but easy to get used to. This game really reminds me of the Just Cause series, so if you're into that game you will defiantly like this one. Overall it's a great game with lots of hours of gameplay (about 16 hours in so far and Im probably at about 5% progress) and will keep you playing for hours on end. Highly recommend"

												Overall the game is fine. Could it be better, of course it could be. The AI are kind of dumb, the driving is blockey but the game for me ran fine with 60-70 fps with FX8350 and SLI GTX 1070. I have yet to play co-op but in the single player experience I found it to be fun but sometimes repetitive and that is with only 3 hours currently logged, hopefully I will find new experiences as I continue to play. In a way this game reminds me of Mercenaries 2 and that is not entirely a bad thing. Do I recommend buying it at 60 bucks.... no wait till a sale for like 40 bucks and till some updates are released as I have read of quite a few FPS issues along with CPU hogging."

												It's a mix of Division, Just Cause and Far Cry in my opinion - huge open world. The cool thing about this game is you can pretty much do as you please activity wise. Realism is lacking a bit with regards to ballistics/ disappearing bodies (happens quick enough during some raids that the other targets won't react). However, very fun/ satisfying for those like I who prefer to explore the towns/ side mission style. 4/5 , 5/5 if a patch teaked the aforementioned realism. (Oh and the graphics are outstanding on GTX1060)."

												Upon the first 30 minutes of gameplay, I witnessed multiple glitches involving disappearing characters and randomized stuttering. The game feels poorly optimized and unpolished at best. Games which look much better (such as Battlefield 1) will hit upwards of 100 FPS on the highest settings on my system, this game struggled to stay above 40. Overall, I cannot justify paying $80, $90 or $120 CDN for this title just yet, as there is quite a bit of patchwork needed before the game can truly be enjoyed. It's a great idea, and a great concept, but at this time, poorly optimzied and poorly executed. Hopefully in a couple months time, the situation will have improved. Until then, I'll say this: Buyer beware. If you expect to run this on Ultra without a multi-thousand dollar system, you're sorely mistaken. Even with a high-spec system, expect stuttering, glitching, frame rate drops and even sporadic crashes."

												This game has hundreds of hours of content. That is amazing, I love the gun play however the vehicle control is weird but you get used to it. Over all the game is amazing and im happy with it.

WHAT I AM NOT HAPPY WITH is the fact that on day one ubisoft has two dlc's planned out and they are selling the weapons and attachments in the store for real money. Ubisoft you need to calm down and stop being greedy. I feel like Ubisoft has dlc on day one becauce they kept that stuff out of the game to sell it later. DLC is not supposed to be there on day one! That just tells people you have been planning and probably making the DLC for a good while now and you didnt just put it in the base game.

Otherwise this game is amazing and you should buy for sure."

												In truth this is more of a ""two thumbs sideways and a noncommittal shrug,"" but that wasn't an option.  I wish there was more than just thumbs up or down, because there are certain people that will love this game.  If you were one of the band that enjoyed the Division, you'll probably be among those singing this game's praises.  However, most PC gamers will find this to be the epitome of mediocre.  In so many ways, this game feels like a Far Cry clone, with a few clever twists.  Just as often I was reminded of Mad Max - this game is prettier than Mad Max if just from the environment standpoint - the graphics are on par honestly - but the controls for Wildlands are worse on EVERY level.  The shooting is passable, but the 3rd person camera is mostly there to annoy.  Cars are passable, but the plane had NO RUDDER at the moment.  

And then there's the already infamous helicopter.  I LOVE helicopters in games - it was one of the things I MOST looked forward to in this game.  *sigh*  Liquor up a monkey and let it drive - it'll do just as well and give you more enjoyment in the process.  Seriously, if more than 5 minutes of effort was put into programming the helicopter, whoever designed the controls for that thing should be fired, have their high school diploma revoked, and possibly demoted back to kindergarten... it's just that sad.

This is not a terrible game, but it's very hard to justify the full-blown price for the mediocrity to be found within.  If you just can't get enough Far Cry and the Division, then maybe.  But if you're even the slightest burned out on those games, maybe take a pass until the Steam Summer Sale when this hopefully hits $20."

- Decent story
- Smooth gameplay mechanics

CONS:
- Matchmaking UI could use some work
- AI needs lots of improvement when it comes to stealth play
- Repetative gameplay

												                                           [IF YOU DON'T HAVE FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH DONT BUY THIS GAME ]
Ghost reacon Wildlands is a beautiful tactical shooter at it's core but lacks some serious features of a AAA standard game.
After craeting a character (Which is lame by the way, its just some random cosmetics except the cool ones locked behind paywall ). Then i joined one of my buddy in co op and played for straight 3 to 4 hours, it was fun but ..... but that's it that is the whole backbone of the game.
For me it's.
                  Graphics : HUGE map with stunning visuals, character and gun models are top notch, day night cycle with weather fx is awesome.

                   Audio & Sound fx : OKish voice acting with sub-par sound fx but i feel like every weapon has same sound almost , with a silencer its PEW PEW without it phut phut.... It is not acceptable for a tactical shooter.

                   Gameplay : It's fun but very repetative but in a good way, scout the area be stealthy or just gunblaze. The AI though are either very stupid or the game feels easy on the hardest difficulty FTW ubisoft (Yes I'm looking at The Division). Again the vast map is beautiful but feels very empty just like Just cause 3. Objectives are same from the first 3 hour , go there kill him/her , go there capture and extract intel , ton of lame fetch quest , till you face the boss , some lame guy with random tatoos on em. No character devlopment no charisma nothing pure tasteless.

                     Overall : For me it is a wait for sale because if you get it now and you dont have friends to play with then you will get bored in 3 to 4 hours ."

												I will try to tell ytou my opinion about this game.I will type some not  that much important things,and i will finish with maybe most interesting and important.
1)Game content:Game has massive content.You have 28 bosses(1 big boss,8 medium bosses,and to be able reach this 8 medium,you must defeat 20 mini bosses).Game is all about this few things:taging resources(oil,medicine,ammo),doing side missions for extra points,skills,story missions(after 5 on the start of game,you can kill mini boss,)-didnt come that much far for now,so idk how many story missions you need to do for future mini bosses;grinding weapon things etc
BUT,that famous BUT xD,content is kinda recycled,because 99% of missions are something like:find laptop and hack it,find evidence and take photos for further things,steal car,steal chopper,what is not cool thing in my opinion(6/10)
2)Driving:one word:♥♥♥♥.Because when you are driving,and hit lamppost during 100KM?h or smash civilian with 20KM/h speed,you will get enormous damage.When you are on some parts of road,you will have bluered textrues,which will cause 5s of freezing(but its very very rare thing).(3/10)
3)Graphic and specifications:Graphic is not impressive alot,bejcause if you dont have high-end mosnter,you wont be able to play onm Ultra on 60FPS,and if you play on <ultra,you will not experience that cool graphich.Most likely it's like comic book,because some builidng and Ai bots,ghave sharps and otuliens,which is making me laughing a lot.Specifications:as you can see you need ot have medium OR medium-end pc to play on Low-Medium grpahich in 40-70FPS.G&S(7/10)
4)Gameplay:You have 2 tactics:stealth and loud.You can change always,from one to the second.For example:you are in middle of alert,they are rushing you,and if you hide good,thhan you will lose ""alerted"" and get ""hunted"",since hunted appear,you can silently kill again,and you are good to go.4 difficulties,whhich is good,each one is step harder because you have less downs,less armor,more realistic sscenario,smarter Ai's,and good fight what is most important to some of us.(10/10)
5)Weapns:In standard edition,you havbe massively big inverotry,a lot of weapons,attachments,camos and stuffs.If you want some specific part for weapon you need to look at the map ""M button"",an than search for blue pistol with screw on it,and on that part of map you can get 2 things:small crate with attachemnt OR big one with weapon in it.You can customise weaponms at any time,by simpl pressing of ""M""-invertory-loadout-chose weapon and change.Ammo is not a big deal,because since you are killing ,you can pick ammo,or find 3 bullets icon on map,and resuply you resources.If we have like 30-40 weapons,and like 100 different)not common)) attachemnts in standard game,what do you expect in seaon pass? ^^ (10/10)
6)Pre-conclusion:Is game interesting?Deffinitely yes.Is game well optimised?So-so,Is game funny to play at least 200 hrs?Deffinitelly yeahhh ^^.Is game non-stop grinding like The Division?Not even close;You have offline and online way of playing the same missions.Is game worth 60€?Not even close;Maybe Digital Deluxe for 60€.Standard one should be 40€.KEYS:Standar 25€,Digital 45€(2/10)

Conclusion:Game is very good from gameplay aspect.From techical,it could be better,but we will see in upcoming updates.You can spend a lot of time solo or with friends.But if you still dont wanna pay a lot of money,you can simply wait for Easter sale or buying key cheeper for approx 30€

1)+2)+3)+4)+5)+6)=6.33/10.In case you care about average grade xD"

												I'm really enjoying the co-op and single player. Played it a while and still not even half way with the campaign. If you enjoy co-op games, this is probably one of the best. 

Quick tip, you can teleport to friendly ghosts and also use the rebel support to spawn a vehicle."

												Worthy successor in the Ubisoft Tom Clancy lineage.

A tactical masterpiece, if Extreme mode is enabled. 

But, too many locked items and side missions to unlock things dilute the overarching narrative. Launch bugs, as expected.

If your PC can handle the surreal environment. Ansel mode is fun."

												Overall the game is fine. Could it be better, of course it could be. The AI are kind of dumb, the driving is blockey but the game for me ran fine with 60-70 fps with FX8350 and SLI GTX 1070. I have yet to play co-op but in the single player experience I found it to be fun but sometimes repetitive and that is with only 3 hours currently logged, hopefully I will find new experiences as I continue to play. In a way this game reminds me of Mercenaries 2 and that is not entirely a bad thing. Do I recommend buying it at 60 bucks.... no wait till a sale for like 40 bucks and till some updates are released as I have read of quite a few FPS issues along with CPU hogging."

												 Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon® Wildlands Review
 First impressions 
This game ran very smooth for me. The game have been optimzed very good since the open beta. My frame-rate never dropped below 75+ fps at near max settings. No crashes or stuttering. The game seems to be getting some pretty bad reviews for so many bad reasons, the usual graphics, 'the physics, open world and driving arent like GTA etc... I think people should take time to appreciate the elements and concepts going on and you will realise it is a good and fun game. People nowdays just dont appreciate games like this anymore sadly. People will also just hate the game just cause' it is ubisoft. If its open world it has to be like gta. If its a shooter it has to be some online mulitplayer shootem run and gun. this is an old school gamers game. Alot of people were also saying this game is just a divsion reskin. In my opinion this is nothing like the division and are different games.  Its similarity is that it's a third person fps to first person aim. The game in my opinon follows more closely to the Farcry series, if you loved farcry you will love this game no doubt. The game it self is epic. Huge map, very interactive and alive. Squad base physics where you
can sneek and wipe out an enemy outpost or go in all guns blazing. It's your choice.
There is a skill tree to unlock the perks you want. 

 Stealth 
Stealth is definitely the way to go and it looks like this it what the game mainly wants you to do, but you can still have a lot of fun rambo the enemy on the streets, going full MLG 420 style.

 Positives & Negatives 
Positives:

•Plenty of side missions so there is plenty of things to do.
•Each mission is your option. I.e loud and rambo mode or sneaky ninja
•Co-op is fun.
•Dynamic World
•The single player experience is pretty fun and nice to chill out to.
•The map has little heat spots which show the density of enemies in the area.
•Pieces of intelligence can be gathered in order to activate side missions and upgrade your character.
•I had a great deal of fun with it, that and I have not played the other Ghost Recon game.
•Very nice character customisation.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=878642296
•The online connectivity is pretty stable
•Amazing graphics like all Ubisoft games
•Co-op everything with up to 4 friends
•Tactical game play
•Beautiful even on low graphics 
•100s of hours of gameplay ( If you do EVERYTHING)

Negatives:

• No ""Jump"" button, instead you are forced to only jump when its available.
•Physics are a bit crazy sometimes (was complete mental during the open beta)
•The controls for the vehicles on both keyboard and controller are wierd af.
•Not that well optimised for machines which are at or above the minimum requirements.
•Car controls are hard to get used to and can randomly change directions at will.
•If the server disconnects and the co-op partner is the driver of a vehicle you are in, the controls seem to lock and the vehicle sporadically moves sometimes.
•Poor car physics ,it's like driving a car in csgo in early beta mod stages , feels very clunky
•Helicopter has a weird self leveling style which make it very hard to control,  not a great experience http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=878633397
•Third person view could be set a little further away from character in my opinion (yes, i know about extended fov.) 
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=878634874

 Disappointed I was hoping for ubisoft for once to not take this direction, but alot of game does this nowdays, but i still don't support this. What i'm i talking about? -> ""In-game currency""..
You have to pay for a Flag badge for example, its not unlocked in the base-game.
You can buy all scopes. All attachments. Basically Everything. This is so sad to see, as it makes grinding more pointless. They clearly milking you for that cash.

 How this game feels like  
Wildlands is:

...like Just Cause series, except instead of getting around by having actual fun with the in-game physics, your main way of travel will be by teleporting with fast travel like a wizard from harry potter.

...like GTA V, except the cities , smooth and working vehicle controls, good customization and player population.

...like Borderlands, except the variety of equipment and weapons.

...like Battlefield, except the map and world design is generic and there aren't almost even any hints of destructible enviroments on the world map.

...like Splinter Cell, except the AI is like spinbotters from CS:GO non-prime on anything above normal difficulty.

...like Sleeping Dogs, except instead of having an intriguing and borderline alternative story where you choose your actions and pick a side with consequences, you're instead force-fed the most generic plotline ever.

...like Watch Dogs, except instead of having ""smoothly"" transitioning between players in singleplayer and multiplayer, you are instead thrown back and forth in the form of neutral and boring af loading screens.

...like Titanfall, except the high-end PvE and PvP content available.

  Do you recommend this game? Yes, definitely. The game have it's flaws but well worth the buy. Its a good and fun game.

 Review update (WARNING! SPOILERS!) 
Negative:
-Enemies disappear after 500m (if not scoped on)
-Bullets sems to travel much slower than in reality
-Story doesn't make much sense after last mission is completed, (when bowman takes down sueno), the rebels is still on your side(they wont shoot you) and if you still have some missions left the people you have taken down will talk from the dead.

- If you focus on only the main story missions your looking at 35hrs of gameplay tops.
- There is nothing to do after the main story is completed (well you can try and collect all medals, legends and side-missions but those are boring af) 
- Very little variation in jets and helicopters (only 2 jets in the game wtf)
- The enemies look ALL the SAME (exept the bosses)
- No ""end-game"" like in The Division

												Huge open world with lots of things to do.
Me and my friends has been playing for 12+ hours ""Day One"" and ONLY completed 2 mission, not that we died all the time we explored, did sidemissions and more.
I can only say im very impressed with this game,
the play style, multiple weapon modifications, clothing, styling of your character.
One thing im missing is when you play as a team, when you find Food, gas, comm and med supplies EVERYONE has to take it to get it and NOT devided to all in the team. In singleplayer mode its ok, multi NOT ok.
Overall the game is great"

												like other reviewers have stated, a new release should not really be weighed exclusively on its performance issues at launch, so my reccomendation comes based on the following.


1. game looks nice, and the world is very big, If you are one of the people that is satisfied with the game play, you are going to get a LOT for your initial investment.
2. a lot of immersion, customizations, skills and stuff to keep you pushing to stregthen your character. TONS of weapons and upgrades, (although im pretty sure you could pass any mission with the start up kit).
3. switching between solo and co-op play is easy, and both sides are equally fun to me. its a pretty good challenge to put the game on max difficulty and try to solo the story missions. its also pretty rad to get into a group and just wreck havoc on everything.


I have seen people crying about the driving, but its no where near as bad as watch dogs 2 or any of the mafia games. it may not quite have the physics dialed in like GTA5, but it works. plus some vehicles have guns, and I actually like the helicopters...

when approaching an outpost , you need to be careful which side you come in from. If there are cliffs ringing the area, you almost always have to approach from another angle , because the climbing is pretty much useless other than small hops and low ledge pull ups. This is one of my only complaints. I'm pretty sure these elite spec op dudes could find more routes up these rocky areas, at least establish some ropes or climbing anchors like other games, so you don't spend 10 minutes skirting a hilltop outpost looking for a way in. 

Ive seen this game compared to the division, and i can draw the same comparisons only asthetically. In the division, the enemies are damage sponges, where a well placed headshot only pulls the NPC. In this game , your aim actually matters, and headshots on normal enemies are one shot kills.

the tactical and stealth mechanics are pretty light, dont expect AI on the level of Dishonored2, but that said, on the max difficulty the bots are pretty nasty. they notice fallen commrades and go on hunt mode, and their aim is ....well ...bot like. this can make for either frustrating or rewarding gameplay, depending on your personal level of patience and willingness to watch and plan. in the end if the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, you can go loud, and even be revived once pre battle by your team mates, if it goes really sideways.


the voice acting is pretty meh, but ive seen a lot worse in AAA titles.

in this day and age , gamers are ever critical of new games, so make sure you are reading into reviews for the things that are important to you, rather than just going by the ratio of good to bad reviews. very few games hit the mark on every box, but this game hits enough of them for me to enjoy it and give it the thumbs up."

												Hey! It's not a bad PC port for once!
Pros:Runs smoothly 
Gun customization
Derpy physics and AI
Large map (JC 3 larger though)
Beautiful landscape
Cons:Derpy physics and AI
Mediocre vehicle handling at best
No real special storyline
No real dialogue (both story and in game AI)
Singleplayer is kind of sad 
Some character customization needs more variety (ex: hair styles)
Notes and Thoughts:Although this game may not be for everyone, I think its okay. Mostly because I got it for free ;). However, if you really like open world sandbox play and all of your friends have this game, it might be worth it to drop some dollars and download 52GB of co-op derpiness. Personally, I thought there might have been more issues the day of launch (9PM PST for me) but I didn't encounter any. If you're still not sure, you might just wait for a sale on this game. ITS DIFFERENT FROM GRAW!!

I have a solid framerate, in the 90+ range, but this is such a glaring issue that I cannot help but feel like it should have been caught in QA. And I didn't have this issue in any other build. I took part in a closed alpha, the closed beta, and the open beta and did not have this issue.

Gameplay is fun, gunplay feels solid, and what's more the open world aspect is very well realized, but I cannot recommend a game that can't properly render ground textures. Whether or not there is delay or it loads them in the fact remains that this crap is ridiculous.

And let's not talk about the insane amount of day one DLC.

But these things won't discourage the review brigade from marking every negative review they can find as not helpful. Shame we've reached this point."

												Before everything, sorry for bad english, i will fix it later :)
 TL;DR : is it good? YES ! 

My review : to be honest i was not expecting it to be so good, when i saw the trailer is was like "" meh, probably will get boring .. "" but i heard you can do every mission in either loud of stealth, which for me is a nice mechanic, one day i will feel like going quiet and one day i will want tto take out anger on some cartel dudes.
my PC is really old and most games i play i run on super low, my specs are lower than the minumum and the game runs amazing ! for me graphics were never important.
so about the gameplay, LOVE IT ! i'm a big ARMA 3 player and my dream was a game that i can be a special forces member that i can customize my guns to the smallest part, to customize my character and to plan my aproach to this mission, i finally got what i wanted ! 
there are many mission and things to do, i'm actually really worried i'll die before i'll be able to do everything haha .. 

now to finish my review i have something to say to the internet, i will sound mad but i'm fine with that. 
i am reading way to many comments complaining the the driving is ♥♥♥♥, the AI is ♥♥♥♥, something is basiclly ♥♥♥♥, and you know what? go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, why? 
the current generation of gamers are cancer, dumb and spoiled, when i grew up, if i didn't like something in a game, instead of complaining i was adapting, and overcoming the "" bad "" stuff. 
the driving is ♥♥♥♥? your'e a bad driver buddy.
the AI is ♥♥♥♥? if the AI was too good you would complain that it's too hard and cry about it.
the game is not running well? it's PC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they can't optimize a brand new game to every PC in the world .. lower the graphics and STFU
this is a good game, deal with it, you have a different opinion? that's great, but bashing the game for ♥♥♥♥ it not deserves is stupid.

thank you everyone for reading the review and i hope you have geat time playing, my score : 10\10"

												Having not really played any massive open world games (Far Cry, Just Cause, barely any GTA) this was very fun. Played with a buddy and just drove around doing missions which were everywhere. I like the guns and abilities. There's a lot of customization and the drone you get is sweet! The movement can be fixed (sprinting kinda feels weird) and there are a few bugs but I give it a 9 / 10"

												This game is Okay. I put 20 hours in day 1 and within 4 days had 48 hours played. I had lots of micro stuttering but no major bugs were experienced personally. Unidad is kinda gay with infinite waves attacking unless you escape, however escaping is easy unless you have to defend an area. 

The missions are all relatively the same Defend, Hack, Tail, Kill or blow up. You can usually run and gun or stealth depending on preferences. In order to do a full campaign restart you have to create a new character which is kinda irritating, however you can restart missions one at a time it doesnt give the same feel. It took me 21 hours to kinda speed run. I didnt really explore outside of getting the guns I want and I did a lot of fast traveling. The game itself will last a long time if you make it. Take your time and set it to extreme with no hud. Easily could take 100 hours to beat. 

The story is good and the co-op is fun, however after beating it it becomes kinda meh. Like you have done it all before. Hope this helps people on the fence about buying the game."

												This is a very nice game. The opimization is great and the graphics are amazing. I love the first person aiming, but I really think making you able to change from first to third while running or driving, or just in general add first person could be a nice feature.

If they would continue to update the game, with new weapons, attachments, and clothes, I would definitley spend more on the season pass. But I ain't buying a season pass of the pricetag on 40 euro when they only have 2 expansions and new cars..."

												Quick review
Hello ^^

The optimization has improved since closed beta, it runs well but it should be noted that it's demandng to render that beautiful draw distance

The gameplay feels somewhat Ghost Recon Future Soldier meets Metal Gear Solid V (it's not as smooth as MGS V in terms of gameplay though, but it's still good) The driving and physics need some work :)

Graphics are lovely, especially the draw distance, an amazing work is done here.

However this game is NOT like the classic Ghost Recon games, it's dumbed down to a more casual and user friendly approach but suits me well cos the flow of time is doing its thing (GRRRR curse you life!!! :P jk)

Thanks for reading my opinion but I would suggest you read other more detailed reviews from more experienced people and ACTUAL reviewers or better yet check gameplay footage on youtube to decide if this game appeals to your taste before you buy it :)"

												I haven't been this into a game in a long time. The environment is beutiful. 

This game is fun whether you have a group of friends to play with nor not. You can play with random people and they are usually good about cooperating and working together.

I haven't experience any major issues or crashes, only a few minor bugs and glitches that are only inconvenient."

												Realy fun! :D 20+ hours in Open Beta
Do NOT play this alone, find someone with similar playstyle and taste as you and you will have an amazing time.

AI: 7/10 they pretty much have aimbot but they act very human while passive
Gameplay: 8.5/10 starts to feel MGS:FP'ish after a while but not quite
Graphics: 9/10
Driving: 9/10 in open beta, after spoiled kids cried, Devs tried to fix it and failed so i'd say 5/10 now

The game is a Blast, i suggest playing with one person though as 3 or 4 might become chaotic. Feels Perfectly made for 2 people."

												Let's not straightly go to criticize Ubisoft. They made a good game that's for sure. The huge game world looks magnificant. Some bugs are still there. They definitely gonna release some patches. What I can possibly say is - It's not a technical success, not a technical disaster either. 

Do I recommend it? Yes if you have a descent rig and got some buddies to play with. You NAT Type must be open in order connect. So keep that in mind. Only one player with strict NAT can join a lobby hosted by the player with open NAT Type. If one strict NAT joins then another strict NAT cannot join. There are ways to open your NAT. Just google it or contact ISP. :) 

Will update the review as more I play."

												Had a blast playing last night, from launch all the way up until 7 AM (CST) this morning!  I participated in both the Closed Beta and the Open Beta and on both occassions I had good experiences. 
 
During the Betas, I only had two issues: 
1. I had my cpu overclocked to 4.6 Ghz (i7 6700K) and somehow this cause the game to crash in the Open Beta but not in the Closed Beta). 
 
2. How long the game takes to read from the HDD - my HDD for the Betas was a Toshiba at 7,200 rpms (my Non-Steam Games HDD) and this is not an issue for other new games, even though HDDs are always slower than SSDs.  So if you are able, I recommend installing this game on an SSD - if possible. 
 
At full release, the game is running on a Seagate at 7,200 rpms (my Steam HDD) still utilizes the HDD heavily, 99% to 100% on loading every time any loading takes place and this is why I recommend installing this game on an SSD is possible. 
 
So, with those two very minor issues out of the way, I must say that I love this game. 
 
Co-op Gameplay - Thus far, I have not played in co-op yet and I can imagine the fun shennanigans that are to be had in that mode.  I am primarily a story driven gamer who does also enjoy a bit of co-op at times and with the right people.  So, if you would like to play in co-op with me then just ask. 
 
The A.I. Teammates - I think they are great to have with me, although I do see where having actuall human teammates will be far more beneficial than the A.I. ones and I am grateful to have the A.I. team with me.  Their stories and banter are funny and they let you know when there are enemies, intel and lootable items present in the area.  When you fall, they will heal you once to give you a second chance to triumph over the enemies. 
 
Do I recommend this game - yes I certainly do.  I have never played any of the previous Ghost Recon titles yet, so I will not compare this one to any of them for obvious reasons.  I do think that there are elements from some other Ubisoft titles that I own and play, such as Far Cry 3 and 4 and perhaps a bit of The Division where we shoot through enemies to get the main boss in an area, but thankfully the enemy NPCs are not bullet sponges with crazy advantages like they are in The Division. 
 
I am playing on Windows 10 with an i7 6700K @ 4.6 Ghz with an EVGA GTX 1070 FTW and 16 GB of G.Skill TridentZ RAM in 1080p on Nvidia GeForce Experience settings with everything turned on - except VSync and Frame Limiting, Long Range Shadows and Nvidia Multi-Frame Sampled Anti-Aliasing.  My fps ranges from 49 to 85 fps in game and everything is very smooth, no screen tearing, no stuttering nor choppiness."

												Love this game.  Best open world military sim to date.   (Next to Arma 3)
Military version of GTA.
Detail and quality of gameplay and scenery is definately worth the price.
Game is alot of fun and highly recommend.
I hope there will be more themed games with this style of gameplay: Iraq, Afganistan, Vietnam, World War II.  The scenery is amazing and non-linear gameplay is alot of fun.

Pros
Huge Map.  Game feels bigger than what I was seeing in preview trailers.
Tons of Vehicles to pick from
Detailed weapon customization
Detailed gear and appearance customization
Lots of different biomes. Tons of different environments to fight in. (Jungle, Desert, Frozen Tundra, Urban, Tropical Islands, etc.)
Tons of different unique places to fight (resorts, airports, cities, countryside, jungle, prisons, military compounds) 
Most buildings you can enter and hide.
Detail of environments is amazing (trash, furniture, variety of objects related to place you are in)
Amazing city and traffic lighting at night.  
Looks and feels like a living breathing world. 
Lots of variety of civilian and enemy targets.
Most realistic flares, I have seen in a game.
Dynamic weather environments that change look and feel of each area.
Game is alot of fun when things don't go to plan.  Alot of things get added to the mix, different types of reinforcements, different types of weapons used against you (anti-air missle batteries, helicopter patrols, armored vehicles, mortars, and machine gun emplacements)
Micellaneous events, firefights, vehicles blowing up, helicopter patrols, flares being fired off in distance, all add alot to the game.  Its not always where you are that action is taking place.  Like GTA and Watchdogs you can watch things happen from a distance which makes the game enjoyable. 
Cons
Dead bodies are not persistant in gun battles.  You can snipe AI and bodies will disappear within a few minutes.  Patrols will only detect bodies if they recently dropped.  Once they are gone no suspicion of missing guards or remains cause alarm with AI.
Vehicle physics needs improved. Cars, Trucks, Motorcyles all feel the same no matter what surface you are driving on.  Weather patterns change but, phyisics of vehicles in those enviroments always feel the same.  The physics in games like Watch Dogs 2 and GTA feel more real. Paved roads, dirt roads, mud, snow, all feel the same on all vehicles in this game.
Helicopters are kinda hard to control.  Especially when using fixed miniguns on helicopters.  There is no real way to target or aim what you are shooting at. Alot of times its spray and pray.  Yet AI will shoot you with pinpoint accuracy.
Game needs more variety of AI behavior and encounters.  AI gets very predictable even with highest difficulty settings.
AI spawn out of thin air next to drone jammers if only switched off and not destroyed.  You can stand next to jammer and spawn kill AI for XP.
AI mortars can see you at all times no matter where you hide, even out of sight, or move to different postion.  Infantry will look at last known position you were spotted.
AI encounters feel kinda like Farcry but, with more variety of encounters. (you will find guys by themselves out in middle of nowhere executing people, random encounters along roadside, checkpoints, armed convoys, etc)
Amazing gear detail, although some details were missed: when nightvision is turned on, your character does not wear night vision goggles, same with thermal vision. 
Squad AI will automatically appear in vehicle if you leave them behind.  I assume this is to help incase AI get stuck in environment with pathfinding.  I prefer to wait for AI to add to realism of the gun battles.
I feel like many of the fortifications should be harder to get in to.  I have my AI on highest difficulty and alot of the bases look harder than they are to get into.  It would be neat if they had motion sensors, anti-personel mines, booby-traps.  I feel like the parimeters to many of the military bases would have more patrols or devices to detect intruders.  Especially when driving up to a base by boat.  Many docks are empty, and there are never any boat patrols.  I would like to see improvements to the fortifications so that they feel impenetrable.  Right now it is very easy to trick AI with diversions and pick them off 1 by 1 until there is no enemy left.
Civilian AI are very dumb and don't really do anything but, stand in the way.  I love having them around in firefights as a challenge.  But, it would be cool if civilians had more personality either alerting or informing factions of your presence, or helping you find information about the area.  As of now they see you and will react.  But, enemy AI don't react or get suspicious by civilians if they see you and flee.  Although, they look very cool and come in different varieties, they really don't do much.  In real life civilians disappear when firefight is about to take place, in south america kites are flown as signals to warn the cartels of police, things like this would add alot to this game.
Faction Behavior is strange at times.  I have seen Unidad Army and Rebel Forces hangout together.  I have seen Unidad Army and Santa Blanca Cartel hangout together.  Then as soon as you appear on scene the Unidad attack you, and then the rebels will attack Unidad.  I have also seen Rebels drive next to Santa Blanca Cartel and not do anything to each other.  Cartel seems to not mind the Rebels and the Rebels don't mind the Cartel.  But, as soon as someone detects you, the fight begins."

												I've played about 5 hours of Wildlands, so that pretty much makes me an expert at this point.

How it feels: The Division

How it looks: Just Cause 3

How it plays: The Division + Metal Gear Solid 5: TPP

This game does all of these things well, but none of them really great. It's a game that has a lot to it, but there doesn't feel like there is a clear direction or incentive to doing them. The base weapon and clothing you get looks cool enough and perform well enough that there isn't a clear need toupgrade them, and the customization is pretty lackluster in that you can upgrade your character for a better drone/more ammo/damage reductiion/etc, but at the end of the day it doesn't feel like you really need to do so.

tl;dr It's a good game, albeit a little copy pasted, with no clear incentive to play the game other than for your own enjoyment.

I give it a 7/10 Ghost Racoons"

												This is my first review on Steam. I find this game worth to review. 

My caveat, the game is not for everyone even you enjoy gta v or mgsv. Because it is neither of them. Stealth and action is well packed and tactical elements are not punishing and demanding as mgsv. Vast open world may get repetitive if you do not like to hang around. Likewise if you are really  into story you might not like the fiction. Do not expect a Witcher or a Snake from this game. 

That being said I don't agree to people  saying that single  player is a boredom. Think that this is like a nice well made action movie comparing Russian movies. If you are for reality, hardcore gaming go to Dark Souls or Arma. Just have fun and don't think the rest. 

Gameplay is extremely fun. Gun play is smooth, action is well paced.There  are some glitches here and there but that's all. Musics are enjoyable. A nice Breaking Bad moment can be experienced in Bolivia. To be honest car physics are sometimes clunky but as far as I read from the first reviews  this issue will be fixed soon. Even now it is not a disaster. 

I experience fps drops with a rig 16 gb ram, i7 4790k 
and gtx 1060 on ultra settings. I can say that Deus Ev mankind divided runs like a charm on ultra high with the same rig. 

There's one thing I do not like. If you are not satisfied with a mission and your cover is blown you do not have to wait to die for restarting. This is really disturbing. But maybe I am missing something. Checkpoints should be enabled somewhere. 

To sum up if you like Splinter Cell and Ghosts Future Soldier with open world experience do buy it. 

If you are into hardcore gaming experience with a detailed characterisation be aware of it. 

My points

Gameplay: 10/9
Graphics: 10/11
Ambience: 10/10
Voice acting: 10/8
Sounds and music: 10/9
Story: 10/6
Characterisation: 10/7
Physics: 10/9

												A decent game, but very repetitive. Hopefully they add in more variety to missions and gameplay. I got this game because in the open beta I met awesome people. We had fun and agreed we'd all get it. I highly recommend doing coop and multiplayer, solo is fun but can get boring fast. Overall a good game but still has a sorta grindly feel. Also alot of glitches and bugs that they seemed not to fix from the betas. Overall a 7/10 ghosts."

												This game is great so far. Im around 15 hours in and I have been playing on the 2nd highest difficulty and have been on a mission to collect weapons and attachments. The AI seems a little slow unless you are playing on the highest difficulty, and the friendly AI is clueless, so definately play co-op. Once I am in a co-op game, it is very difficult in the higher zones. The starting zones seem easy and meant to just get you going with how to play. The higher level areas and Unidad F.O.B's really test your stealth. Definately worth taking a look at. I think alot of these reviews are based on only the first zone or two and can't be taken as a full review of the game. Make sure you check time played. If its < 4 hours, they probably didn't see the full game. Bottom line is this is a fantastic game, and it is a ton of fun with friends. Check it out."

												Out of the 8 hours ive played this game ive been having alot of fun I play mostly with friends since we have been waiting for almost a year for this game to come out,
 
here are some pros and cons,

Pros,
1 Map is exspansive and beautiful
2 Free to play the missions any way you want and from whatever angle
3 Playing tactically is rewarding and difficult to master,
4 Customazation is suprisingly really good
5 Story is pretty good and seems like it will take a while to complete
6 The abliity to steal any and all kinds of vechicles makes this much better than the division ever hoped to be
7 Playing co-op makes this a much more immersive and way more interesting.

Cons
1 Vehicle handeling is a joke
2 Dont bother with the little bird style helicopters they fly like russian tanks dive bombing the Nazi's
3 The Friendly AI are more of a joke than a help, constantly getting stuck by trees, falling off cliffs, unresponsive.
4 sometimes when shooting out lights the Light point will continue to shine while the light bulb is shot out
5 enemies can somehow spot you in a bush 100 meters out while in a bush at night.
6 If you co-op with less than 3 other players the game doesnt add the extra AI to make it a 4 man crew.
7 Vechicles sometimes load in and clip through rocks trees and other items, (it will launch you to the moon if you get in)
8 you cant jump only vault, and sometimes it means you get stuck on a cliff or rack face that you could easily jump on to 
9 voice acting is subpar 6/10
10 Team based charachter realtionship builidng so far is very bland.


ALSO THIS GAME IS VERY TAXING ON YOU PC
HIGHLY CPU BOUND.

for reference I use 
1 Intel 6600K Watercooled
2 Nvidia Founders Edition 1080 Watercooled
3 16Gbs DDR4 Corsair dominatior plats
4 500Gb 850 Evo SSd

Overall good game

												not too shabby so far Ubisoft, I'm actually kinda proud of you.


Looks great, minor fps issues still linger but pretty fantastically optimized.


I can't tell ya much about the kids difficulties but throwing this ♥♥♥♥ on the hardest makes things pretty intense like realism mode tends to do in Tom Clancy games.


Play with your friends, that was one of the main selling points of the game. Games are boring if you make them boring, stop expecting Call of Duty to come out for the first time again its a military shooter for christ's sake."

												Great game, feels more like GTA or MGS:V than previous ghost Recon's. Some mechanics are busted, like having your team noscope everything for you. Graphics are great.
Didn't expect to like it this much."

												Dont play it alone.
Played co-op even only 2 man is where this game really shines.

I also reccomend each player takes a designated role.

Support/Drone Operator/Pilot
Sniper/Long Range Cover
Demolitions
Point man

Played like this (especially if you assume the pilot is the only one who knows HOW to pilot)

Makes the game even more interesting."

												I don't usually pay full price for a game without Fallout in the title, but retail therapy is what it is. GR:W is a typical Ubi game in the sense of repetition with regards to uncovering map areas, side missions, climbing towers, looting collectibles. It plays like a cross between Far Cry and The Division, with elements of Just Cause. It's very satifying to take down a compound with three friends over voice chat (as with any game TBF). 

The combat is very tight, and the guns feel powerful and responsive. The driving is skewy at best. I've found it much easier to use a controller for air vehicles. The ground vehicles handle pretty well, and are a lot of fun. The AI is pretty on par, much better than say L4D bots, though I've noticed it doesn't always get out of the way of a blast radius. The skill tree is very compact, yet still accessible, but doesn't lead to any branching characters with regards to replayability (at least unique replayability). Character customisation options are varied, you're sure to find an avatar you like. The specialised PC GFX options are much appreciated in this day and age, especially on a multiplatform release, and especially as I've just bought a new rig with a 1080. 

I like the game and I'm going to complete it, so I'm going to get my money's worth. Not sure about the DLC at this stage.

Bugs I've noticed after 20 hours: 

- One where I suddenly couldn't use binoculars or a drone; Restarting solved the problem. 
- One where I accidentally destroyed a supply convoy, but was still able to GPS-tag the wrecked car for rebel pickup. 
- If you smash the headlights on your car, the lightbeams still project onto the road. It's far easier to drive with NVG at night, so removing that really wouldn't cause a problem to the player (even though NVG is an unlockable skill). It's just weird looking back at the front of your vehicle and seeing smashed headlights projecting light.
- Another, not really a bug, but I got stuck in a hole reconning a compound, I had to fast travel out and restart the assault (troops had respawned). 

For the size, scope and quality of the game, these are fine IMO.

Couple tips I wish I'd have learned earlier:

- Max Sync Shot early. It means your team can take out four targets simultaneously.
- Even if you don't use stealth, using your binoculars and drone will help you recon and give you exact enemy positions.
- Use the radial menu to control the AI. They're pretty good, but sometimes need a hand.
- Prioritising choosing skill point and weapon locations when scouting intel will make it a lot easier to level up
- Make sure you're away from roads when reconning. Several times I have been spotted and engaged by a simple gang car driving by on a road, which in turn enrages the base. I'm also terrible at games, so this one may not be a prolem for you.
- Always drive off. The AI will teleport into however many free seats are in your vehicle (up to three obv). It's a little immersion-breaking, but it's far better (read: fun) than waiting for three separate bots to get in three separate doors before you even think about accelerating away.

Final line: It's a very good game, and if you can forgive Ubisoft tropes, it's a great game, and it's even better in MP."

												Here is my review so far upon Tom Clancy's Wildlands I hope anyone who reads it enjoys and finds it helpful

When this game first came out Ubisoft had stated that it would be ""the first of its kind"" and quite frankly I feel that it has lived up to being that standard. When you first get into the game you get to customize your character to play how you are like most games however you get to cusomize not only your hair your eyes and anything dealing with your face, but you also get to cusomize your footwear, vests, jackets, ect.. which gives the game a little more sense of realism because you change based upon what you are doing. Next what I felt that the customization upon your weapons is extremely realistic as not only are the guns mainly based off those that would actually be used but you get an in depth view of what each add-on will do to each weapon, not only that but they give you a little history of the guns (This is not including all the vast paint styles they offer to truly make the guns your own) and they have every weapon to cater to anyones playstyles whether you want to go loud and proud they have Large Machine Guns, you wnat to be a hunter in the distence- vast selection of auto to bolt action snipers, you want to be a fast close quarter combat person-they have Sub-Machine Guns for you, or if you want to go at that medium range- they offer a nice range of Assault rifles. After you get yourself all primed and geared you should take a few seconds to look at the graphics and how well they made them. Realism was their main goal when you look at the graphics and I for one think they achieved that goal from the way the grass, trees and bushes sway in the wind depending on how strong it is, to the lightning that strikes down on the mountains as it starts pouring rain to even the rain evaportating against the hot roads (I have seen this only a few times during my time playing). Granted not only did I find the things of graphics, your person, and their weapons great but I found the story to be even better. Some had complained that the story would be to short in the beta however, they are far from being correct. The story has you taking down the cartel one faction at a time, each faction however has two bosses one is the underboss and the second is the head of that faction, and before you even reach the underboss you have to eliminate five bonchos (also know as underlings who answer to the underboss). These bonchos will have a set of missions (that you have to find before you can even do them by interogating intel, stealing, or hacking computers) that will range from five missions all the way up to twenty (the best part is not even Boncho will actually end the same way but im not going to spoil lol). Although I love the game there are a few things that could be worked on one of which would have to be the occasional freezing where the game will freeze and have you go to the menu by pressing esc then go back (this might be for certain computers or laptops but a few of my friends have also experienced this so hard to say). Another thing would have to be the long load times into the game itself when you click to start it the game as it's so big it takes a few minuets before it even loads into fullscreen. While this game is still very young as it only came out this past monday night-tuesday I rate it a 8 out of 10 as they clearly spent a large amount of time focusing on realism and environment as well as the enjoyment for the players. I would however recommend that this game should be played with friends and not by yourself as this was a game made to not really be soloed (even when you solo the game you still get 3 ai's that accompany you where ever you go). I would also recommend that people who like games that are open-world, first person shooter/ third person shooters, co-op, or military games should look into buying this game as it accomadates all those and many more.

Thanks for reading and remember ""We are the ghosts who will stop the Cartel"""

												Great game to play! There are pros and cons when it comes to playing, however.

Pros:
Runs very smoothly
Graphics look great and are adjustable to your preference
The Multiplayer/Co-op option for this game works great, and it's fun to play with other people
What I also noticed about playing online is that the game pairs you up with players closer within your location/city. From personal experience of playing on the Open Beta as well as the official release, which I think is neat
The difficulty settings are set up nicely for people who want an easy gameplay experience or for those who really want to challenge themselves in extremely tactical battles and missions

Cons:
This game takes up a lot of disk space; about 40gb
It does not run well on everybody's computer based on the specifications you guys have, which is a big downfall because this game requires a very good system to run on, whether it is PC or laptop based, and that's not something that everybody can financially afford
The controls for the transportation for vehicles and aircraft (ie. helicopter) are only somewhat decent. I have played games with better movement controls than this
The cash shop is somewhat of a cheat because you can buy items there without going through the struggle of unlocking it through general gameplay (solo or multiplayer campaign), which kind of loses its purpose of making it a more challenging game

I have so far not experienced any sort of issues with the games yet in terms of bugs or other technical errors, but hopefully that is something that can be reportable and without difficulty to pass through to the service.

Overall rating is 8/10"

PRO's
丶This game has a MASSIVE map, id say three or four times of gtav
丶This game has lots of things to do, unlike gtav online which is so boring after you bought all the cars you can and done all the mission you can
丶This game has a easy to learn combat system(i played all kinds of fps and by far it is the best game ive played)
丶This games stalking and recon systems are also done extremely well, there is almost 0 bugs
丶This game has a very good envoronment, when your playing the game it really puts you as operators in a brutal South American country to take out thugs
CON's
丶This game is very expensive
丶The dlc's in game such as face color and skins are also very expensive
丶This game can run at least if you have a gtx960 video card(I use gtx 1060)
丶This game will need you to find real-life teammates and use mics to talk with them in order to do missions faster
丶The AI's on both sides are sometimes very dull
丶This game requires uplay, which will be hard to sign up in regions like China
SUMMARY:
To sum it up, I mostly recommend this game, very very much, however , I do not agree it is ubi's best sandbox game, I believe steep is(in my heart).Hope you liked my review, p.s. this game will be very easy if you have played any ubi game before, such as watch_dogs."

												This is a fantastic game! It is a third person, open world shooter. I would liken this game to the likes of GTA V and classic Ghost Recon games with a blend of Far Cry and Splinter Cell splashed in. The game looks amazing and it offers more differences in terrain than any open world game I have played, including GTA V. It has mountains, desert, snow, forest, jungle, farmlands, flooded plains and a huge flat white salt lake bed,  all of which are found across the varied and vast regions within this game. Graphics are superb. It's a classic open world Ubisoft game.It does have that typical open world Ubisoft gameplay of go get this, go collect that and go explore this and the game has had some critique over this. However, it encourages players to explore the vastness of this world and find some nice little hidden gems along he way and some comical storylines. I wouldn't expect a Ubisoft game to be any different. Some of the side missions can be repetitive, however they are still different in their own way. The main story is ok and you can attack the main story in any order you like. It's great to play with mates as well as solo. Some of the mechanics could be a bit better and I still have not worked out how to effectively use a helicopter in combat!! It seems impossible to control. But overall, it's solid and would highly recommend this game to anyone that likes open world and something different."

												As much of ubisoft hater as i am, i have to say the game is a big step forward. It still needs 1-2 more patches for optimisation, but it's really fun in multiplayer, if you are lucky enough to find a decent group(which isn't rare).

My biggest issue with the game right now is armored bushes. It really annoys the hell out of me, when i can see enemy behind the bush, but bullets just won't go through it. Really want bullet penetration mechanics introduced to this game."

												I have this problem where every once in a while I think, ""Hey, maybe -this- Ubisoft game will be good.""  Then boot it up and realize: crap, this is just another Ubisoft game.  And frankly?  For as expensive as it is, 100$ is what they'd like you to spend with the option for microtransactions, you are getting a mediocre open-world co-op shooter with a veneer of a AAA game.  Here's the thing Ubisoft, if you can't do it well, maybe just don't do it at all.  It honestly feels like every aspect of this game was developed by a different team, and you know what?  It probably was.  So I have no idea who greenlit this game, I have no idea what focus testing led them to the decisions that make it what it is: but it sucks.

If, like me, you don't have a taste for the odd collect-o-thon style gameplay that Ubisoft calls content it's probably not for you anyways.  That said, this game has issues all it's own.  Most noticeably that the AI is total garbage.  Enemies only have three states: unaware, alert and dead.  No 'advanced' behaviors seen in games like MGS:V, Sniper Elite or even Call of Duty, I'm not sure they even seek cover!  And guess what?  Your teammates are somehow worse!  They can't/won't drive, walk out of cover at random, don't effectively engage enemies, teleport to you because they can't pathfind, etc... But oh boy, there is a whopper of a special nail Wildlands coffin: it has GTA-style police and wanted levels.  I'm dead serious.  A tactical co-op shooter about special operations forces has a phantom spawning task force like the police in GTA.  I was awestruck.  Helicopters and Humvees just spawn right in around you.  Thinking back, Wildlands simple gameplay is a lot like GTA III.  Simple AI, wonky physics, arcade-style shooting.  If it weren't for the graphics, you could mistake it for a GTA III mod.  I was under the impression this was some sort of tactical squad-based shooter, not an arcade sandbox!  Pepper in the uninspired missions, writing and upgrade system, and add a strong dose of bugs and I couldn't uninstall and request a refund fast enough.

Let me talk about that AAA veneer real quick though since that's clearly what you are paying for.  Like the gameplay, the graphics in this game are lifeless.  Sure, it has high resolution textures and a heaping nVidia powered eye candy, but everything is static.  If things move, like leaves, it's with canned animations you can watch cycle.  Most things can't be destroyed or damaged.  I'm not even sure they have more than a dozen different models for generic NPCs.  All the graphics in the world can't hide how shallow and uninteresting this world is.  Ubisoft let you torch fields in 2008 with Far Cry 2, yet nine years later they can't manage basic world interaction?  I'm sure this game was very expensive to make, but if they want to pass that cost off on me well, when coupled with the comotose gameplay, I just really don't see where the money is going honestly.

If we learned anything from No Man's Sky it should be it doesn't matter how big your map is if the gameplay is weak.  The map here certainly is huge, but there is little in the way of tactical or strategic depth beyond picking the weapon you think is coolest.  So let me be perfectly blunt: for $100 this game should be a hell of a lot better than this.  This is unacceptable.  I don't recommend it and, since I was idiotic enough to try it, I'm telling you that if you made the same mistake as me and bought it: request a refund.  Ubisoft isn't going to fix this mess."

												Maybe the best map i have seen in games. Big, detailed and live. Plus great graphics, perfect sounds, fluid gameplay and good atmosphere: Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands is one of the best games even it is an Ubisoft product. Car and aircraft physics are the biggest cons with some other minors.

-Is it playable solo?
-Absolutely. You can command your crew and also rebels to play tactical style. It works in most situations. Of course playing with friends is better but if you  have to play solo, this game is perfect for you. I strongly recommend you to play SLOW. Dont rush anything, think before you act, command AI, watch videos, read intels, spend time in villages and cities, watch the enviroment, follow the story. Otherwise the game will be a pain for you. Personally i have finished 1/10 of the game in 15 hours. That speed appear to be my sweet point to get the most fun. Have fun!"

												GO TO THE BOTTOM FOR TL;DR 


THE VERY GOOD

- This game starts off really fun for the first ten or so hours.

- Lots of beautiful, varied environments that are pretty fun to explore.

- Pretty big variety of weapons to choose from (Granted, some are a lot better than others)

- Beautiful looking game, provided your computer can handle the higher settings.


THE GOOD

- Gunplay is pretty sound. Only complaint is that shooting from 3rd person is a bit wonky.

- Most of the underboss/operation head missions are a lot of fun. 

- The map is probably one of the largest in any game, and the stuff to do in it is pretty well spaced out in my opinion.


THE MEH

- Optimization isn't terrible, but I wouldn't recommend this game for anyone that's running on a lower end rig or a laptop, because this game can be quite demanding even on the lower settings.

- The story missions for the buchons are either a hit or a miss, some can be pretty unique while others are just pretty basic tasks that are basically the same as some side missions.


THE BAD

-The physics in this game aren't terribly good, and can even be game-breaking if you're unlucky enough.

- The game does very little to attempt to immerse you in the world. The narrative is mainly told through optional videos and documents that you can pick up at your discretion.

- This might be expected on launch, but there are WAY too many bugs and glitches that negatively impact the experience. (Especially in multiplayer) Thankfully, the devs have been pretty good about hammering out the existing bugs and most of the more game-breaking ones should get patched pretty soon.

- A lot of the skills are pretty generic stat boosts, with the exception of those that give you new gear. 

- With the exception of the main antagonist, the voice acting is pretty terrible. Not necessarily a big part of the game, but still pretty bad nonetheless.

- As is to probably be expected, this game's AI is pretty bad, which is why I would recommend doing multiplayer as opposed to singleplayer. Some of the AI teammates will even shoot at objectives that you need to keep intact/alive.


THE VERY BAD

- The story of this game is pretty terrible. There are way too many untouched plot points and there are very few characters that do anything to drive the narrative of the story. The buchons and the protagonists are very generic and there's really nothing in the game that makes you want to explore the story any more.

- Some of the character animations are noticably weird. Some of the more egregious examples of this are during the opening cutscenes and the interrogation cutscenes.

- After the first 10 hours the game really starts to run out of steam. Doing the side missions gets really tedious and once you get to the late game there's nothing to incentivize you from doing them any more. With the exception of the more important ones, the story missions get increasingly more monotonous.

- (BIG STORY SPOILERS) Both of the game's endings are pretty bad. They just end up with you having to spare the main antagonist beause the idiots at the CIA say ""muh we need to catch terrorists xd"" and the only difference is which parts of the world are screwed over.

- Excluding an increased amount of rebels, there are very few things in the game that change one you start to dismantle the cartel. While at face value this isn't bad, it really discourages you from actually progressing in the game because your actions really don't have effects.

TL;DR

I wouldn't recommend this game unless you have a bunch of frends who have it and want to play it or if this thing goes on sale. I don't regret purchasing this game, but for a AAA title it has way too many shortcomings. Definitely not a terrible game by any stretch of the imagination, but certainly not worth the $60 pricetag. Moreover, I wouldn't ever recommend this game to people with low end PCs or those who enjoy more story driven games. There are some redeeming factors for this game but the negatives definitely outweigh the postitives."

												After roughly 4 hours i can tell you that from what ive seen its a great game. Nice open world, different weapons, good looking terrain, etc. It reminds me a bit of Far Cry 4, mainly because of how you access missions, which you do by going to its location on the map. Only problem is that in the beginning when you were creating you character it took a long time to load everytime you tried looking at a new face (for me idk if anyone else had that problem). Great game so far"

												I enjoy this game and think it is a nice game, Now do I think it should be 60 dollars, no more like 40 dollars. But just wait for a small sale if you want this.

I mainly just miss Ghost Recon Games. I loved them and played a few and put hours in them. This game is finally letting me do that again"

												This game replaces the bullet-spongy enemies and the monotonous corridor shooting of The Division, and revamps it into an open-world set smack in the middle of Bolivia with lots of foliage and vegetation, and where enemies are deadly.

A must-buy for both the casual gamer and the military tactitian!

WARNING: This game DOES have microtransactions. However, most can be unlocked through regular game progression and collectables, and doesn't take a stupidly long time to do so. Stay away from them, and play the game as it should be played."

												Look, It is mostly PVE, but here are my pros and cons

Pros: 
Graphics are actually decent
The AI Teammates in solo are useful
If you play with friends, or randoms it will be a great time (Seriously)
The campaign is something to stick to

Cons:
The shot register can be an issue, even when you try to go the long shot (500+ Meters)
and thats about it I can think of...."

												Quick review
Hello ^^

The optimization has improved since closed beta, it runs well but it should be noted that it's demandng to render that beautiful draw distance

The gameplay feels somewhat Ghost Recon Future Soldier meets Metal Gear Solid V (it's not as smooth as MGS V in terms of gameplay though, but it's still good) The driving and physics need some work :)

Graphics are lovely, especially the draw distance, an amazing work is done here.

However this game is NOT like the classic Ghost Recon games, it's dumbed down to a more casual and user friendly approach but suits me well cos the flow of time is doing its thing (GRRRR curse you life!!! :P jk)

Thanks for reading my opinion but I would suggest you read other more detailed reviews from more experienced people and ACTUAL reviewers or better yet check gameplay footage on youtube to decide if this game appeals to your taste before you buy it :)"

												Very good game for Coop play

- Big World  with lots of variety
- Awesome Gfx
- good controlls

the bad things maybe come down to Vehicle controll and bugs they dont feel very good and are like rubber and glued to the ground.

the quest design could be repetetive but for me its not a big issue but it is an actuall issue!

All in all i would recommend it if you like Coop games!"

												Wildlands has been a blast so far! It's a great game to coop with your friends and even without coop, it's still pretty fun. It basically feels like an enhanced, more detailed version of Far Cry 4 with a mix of The Division, in a good way. I heard they are adding some PvP elements to the game in the future, which will add yet another layer of fun."

												Nice enough game with a lot of lovely content..
Can be stunning in places.... Real pleased I was able to buy it.

Varied gameplay; tons of options... Bots to Live MultiPalyer Ops at the flick of a switch.

Runs great on my 3-year old rig with a newish GPU (GTX1070).
Has a few things a few percent of people with strange expectations are ungrateful about..

1) The Game is designed to look even better on future hardware (such as the very recently released GTX1080Ti).
2) A GOOD rig is required to run this game. A top i5 or an i7 is going to be the way to go. No potatoes.
3) It did run nicely on Medium settings on my 3y/o Haswell i5 R9 280 Crossfire rig... No complaints there.
4) You NEED a Good Internet connection. We have Fiber-Optic and have no connection issues in the Far East.
5) A GTX1070 Will run it nicely on Pretty High settings; assuming you have a good Motherboard & upated Drivers.
6) Make sure you install the game on a good Gaming-Hard-Drive/SSD, and not on some rusty old File Drive.
7) Enjoy.... 
    ...it might take a while to get your head around all the details of the game and what to do, but that`s good. 
 
Oh, and yes there are a couple of bugs.. 
Those of us who re-map cannot steer the motorcycles.
There is no Mapping for the 6-Home/End Keys.... for some unknown reason.
There may be others I have not found yet."

												1st review EVER, out of probably 100 games.   I expect that I'll get some hate from this review, but whatever. 

I've only played for 10 or so hours, but from that I can tell you that  I like the game, but I definitely do not love the game.   I'll try to sum up some issues below. 

The Good:

This game is a large, beautiful open world game.   The game adapts, and changes to reflect things that you've done within the game.    The 1st person view while looking down the scope is perfect.   Also just when you think that the game's starting to get repetitive, it throws you a curve ball.   WIthout spoiling anything, the enemy becomes more challenging.  These are all great things!   The game is fun to play, even with it's quirks which I'll try to mention some of my findings below. 


The Bad:

The game needs work.   Playing with bots alone comes with a large learning curve.  The bots hang way behind you, and the only way to get support from them is to either die, or to have them take the shot by using SYNC command.   It's taken me a bit to make this my game style.  This is fine, but be keep track of who you have SYNC set for, and don't forget to only take your shot when all of the SYNC targets, and YOUR target are away from anyone else, to not alert other enemies.   I made the mistake a few times of thinking only the keybinding (Q) was to initiate the SYNC take down command, and the bots take their shots when I fired my rifle at someone who was away from else.  Bad move because it can ruin the mission by alerting everyone else around them.

Another issue I had with the game is that for some missions it doesn't show a countdown timer on timed missions. I sometimes don't know whether it's a timed mission, or not until it's too late.   I  get caught off guard with a bot saying something about 'do you think we'll make the time limit' when you're running low on time, and by then it's already too late.  I've gotten use to looking for supplies right after completing the area, before attacking the 2nd target.  It's not obvious that there's a 2nd target until after you've completed the 1st one.  The missions don't seem to be replayable if you fail them.  I've been alt+F4 before it saves so I can replay them. 


The Unfortunate:

I bought the game full price through Steam so I could play with people on my Friends List.   Once installed, the game redirected me to Uplay, and you're logged in through UPlay, and cannot see your Steam Friends List.  At least that's how it works from what I can tell. 



Other Thoughts:

If you have people on your UPlay friends list, and can play Co-Op, the game will be much more fun than single player.  Playing with randoms will not make the game any better.   They will revive you about as much as I revive bots.   The game as single player is still fun, but it can be very frustrating. 

Playing solo can be very challenging, which is both good and bad.  

I honestly wish the whole game was 1st person, instead of 3rd person with 1st person view while aiming.  I don't normally play 3rd person games and get caught walking off of stairwells.   This definitely isn't a flaw of the game, more that I wish you could have the option of playing 1st or 3rd person view.   

If you're planning to play this game solo, wait for the price to drop some."

												 Its very hard to review this game. Its a Mix of GTA V, Far Cry Series, Just Cause 3 (minus the Grapple Hook) and yet you die with about 4-5 hits 

I pre ordered this game waaay back , then refunded it after playing Closed and Open Beta due to huge NAT issues and the linear structure of missions. Its just the same go here, Kill this, tag that, extract that, intercept this missions. However, the Co-op more than makes up for it. 

This game  shines when you play on Co-op. The fun of taking out targets and marking them is just gleefully fun. I had to re-buy this game after a few of my friends almost forced me to buy it only for the Co-Op.

The Post launch NAT issues seems to have been ironed out so far too, with no NAT issues so far.

 Major Gripe - Microtransactions 
Seriously Ubisoft??? Half the Cosmetic stuff locked away beyond credit packs? FFS!!! Stop this travesty already. 

 I am an Indian so if you think I am gonna buy the cosmetic stuff and not Grind them the hell out, you're wrong Ubisoft 

So far a mediocre-Good game with some really strong elements (Huge Map, Lots of unlockables, Co-Op) and some really weak ones (Driving, Flying)."

												WILDLANDS

Nice environment
Nice sounds
Nice graphics
Nice gunplay
Nice loadouts and customization

Terrible co-op disconnect problem
Terrible vehicle controls - especially the helicopter
Terrible uni-mmersive civilian AI
Terrible glitches - people appearing outside of vehicle in co-op

This game needs to be updated and shouldn't have been released fully in this state.

Farcry + The Division + GTA + Arcade State of Decay driving...

4 hours of trying to play with a friend, constant disconnects after 5-15min. Spent most of that time simply trying to look online for people having similar issues trying to fix it.

4/10. 

Requested a refund. 
May rebuy when it's patched and playable in co-op for ALL players. 

Refund denied...

Second refund request.

Refund denied...

												 Review 
This game isn't that bad and honestly I've been really enjoying it. The missions are somewhat repetitive, yes. It can get tiresome but I feel as like every approach is different. The main premise of the missions is usually snatch and grab however there isn't much way around it basing it off what would happen in a scenario as such. But the choices on how to deal with targets are fun. You can stealth it up or guns blazing or a little bit in between. 


The driving mechanics are a bit meh but I honestly didn't buy it expecting it to handle like Project Cars or anything like that so I'm honestly not dissapointed. The collisions between objects (since the beta) has improved significantly, you're no longer driving a 3 lb marshmellow around that floats down cliffs, cars feel like they have weight and although handles not the best, it feels nice. Flying is alright, nothing special. Helicopters: Hold down shift to a good height, hold w until it tilts down then bobs back up, let go of w and keep holding shift. Planes: Hold shift and ocasionally (besides landing and take-off) press w and s.

Gunplay and customization are really outstanding here. You can change virtually everything about your gun and the amount of guns are very pleasing. The attatchments and guns aren't all given to you but you must gather intel in that region to find out where attatchments and different guns are located at. Characters also have a good deal of customization to make your character feel like they are ""yours"". 

Overall, I feel like this game is worth a try and with combining beta hours to this, I have logged 21 hours and feel as if this game still isn't stale and should be on to pickup, albiet, if skeptical (beyond anything, even after looking up gameplay), definitely wait for a sale.

            Catagory        Rating (1-10)                Character Customization        8                Campaign        6.5                Guns        9                Vehicles        6                Map        9.5                Coop Experience        10              OVERALL        8.5      


I'm using an i7-2600 @ 3.40 GHz, 16 GB RAM, and a Sapphire R9 390 Nitro and get around 65 fps and this game is optimized for Nvidia cards, I'll be switching when the 1080ti comes out though."

												so I love this game, honestly one of the most fun open world games I have played ever. It's like a third person far cry with friends and a bigger, more diverse world (and by diverse, I don't mean race, I mean scenery). The only complaints I have is that the gameplay can get a LITTLE bit repetitive and the optimization could be better on PC. I have a i7 4770k and GTX 980 TI, and can run the game at very high (with HBAO+) at 50-80 fps most of the time, but I have friends who have GTX 660s and can't run the game smoothly unless they are playing at 720p on the lowest settings. I also have tried playing this game with a GTX 770, and it was awful. I couldn't get 60 FPS on medium with that card, and same processor. Other than those gripes, good game! Would recommend this, great ubisoft game."

												In general, the game is fun. Gone are the days of little puny maps and limited game play. 

Pros:
Great gameplay ( I don't consider this Ghost Recon but, ok..)
Great graphics and visuals.
interesting storyline
HUGE map (forget about the last titles created in the 3rd by UBISOFT)
Great ability to make a character that looks real (some cheesy looking characters)
respawning is near your objective (see cons:)
Cons:
I'm level 4 now and the game locked up on me by a helo base and It took me 5 minutes to get my MSI gaming laptop to turn off. just heard my speakers squealing. 
some missions are about impossible to complete. 3 minutes to get into the mine???? puhlease.
bugs are still abound and need to be worked out. See Con #1
typical, money suck machine. buy weapons packs to get better weapons, uniforms and such
This is a money grab to get you to buy packs, weapons, clothing, facepaint(ok..), country patches.
the 3rd person driving view. (on the pro side: the huge map makes the fun expansive and the driving view point not so bad)
no support units (having been in the military, ALL units have support units for support in heated battles.)
4 man play. no real military foundation of gameplay. helicopters are too tough. a 7.62 or full mag of 5.56mm should damage the helo to bring it down or not function properly, I would know.
respawning, I started the silver mine mission at night and then respawn puts me back at mid day roughly. dumb to do missions in braod day light."

I was experiencing autosave stuttering. (dreaded skull in bottom right corner) 

HOWEVER, i can confirm switching JUST UPLAY ITSELF to an SSD fixed this issue for me.

Im not about to throw a 50 Gb game onto my SSd just yet, but if any issues arise from having game on HD, and Uplay on SSD i will update :)"

												I only have 1.9 hours in the game so far BUT I wanted to state that the optimization and performance is MUCH, MUCH improved since the ""beta"". If that was keeping anyone away, it's much better now (especially if you're rocking a Nvidia card).  The game is pretty fun so far. Thankfully NO iconic Ubisoft towers (yet) and the A.I. ACTUALLY talks to eachother. So far I'm having fun!"

												Realy fun! :D 20+ hours in Open Beta
Do NOT play this alone, find someone with similar playstyle and taste as you and you will have an amazing time.

AI: 7/10 they pretty much have aimbot but they act very human while passive
Gameplay: 8.5/10 starts to feel MGS:FP'ish after a while but not quite
Graphics: 9/10
Driving: 9/10 in open beta, after spoiled kids cried, Devs tried to fix it and failed so i'd say 5/10 now

The game is a Blast, i suggest playing with one person though as 3 or 4 might become chaotic. Feels Perfectly made for 2 people."

												This is my first Ghost Recon game so I might have a more sentimental than critical view on the game generally. I got really frustrated at first especially due to the stuttering problem I was having with the game which definitely had nothing to do with my PC specs. I felt like if I had written the review before I got it fixed, it would probably have been a thumbs down because the game is really promising. I like the whole idea behind the plot and the game setting even though its not exactly accurate. Not veryexpansive with character customization but the variety in outfits makes up for it, sort of. It also comes with a good number of guns that we probably know and love from the division and battlefield franchises, most of which have to be retrieved or bought. I dont see it having a high replay value though once the boss has been taken care of. Sure, there are rebel missions and skill missions that can be undertaken after but it is rendered moot once the goal of the game has been accomplished unless you want to completely take over with maxed out rebel support and player skills. All in all, I think its a very good game that will be fun playing both with friends and solo as the AI are fully engaged and tactical as well (sometimes I prefer using them to actual players), I'm excited for what the game has in store for the near future and I really hope it gets new content!"

												First impressions after 2 hours are good. The game sort of reminds me of Arma, but with a much easier go of it and a bit more polished. I really like the binoculars and drone use, as well as the stealth options and nightvision. The game runs very smoothly for me and without any frame issues so far for my I7 3770 - MSI GeForce GTX 1060 rig. Driving on the road seems a bit unpolished, but its not completely bad. The Bolivian drivers will all cower in fear a bit too much, but thats not that bad either. For the most part I think its a fun game... not sure if it will be a long lasting one, but a good one. Controls are mapped out very well and quick to learn as well. 

Whoa.. its a lot of fun. Seems the motorcycles are the best way to get around.  :D"

												While the game touts it's featured Co-op gameplay, a sizable portion of complaints on Ubisoft's own forums reinforce that not all players will be able to enjoy it. If you experienced the error of Tarjita-00100 during beta play allow me to save your time and money by letting you know that it has not been fixed, nor has Ubisoft even found a solution to it.

The Tarjita-00100 error is related to your network setup and characterized by the in-game setting of ""Nat Type: Offline"". Ubisoft's support staff's only reccomendation to resolve the issue is to forward ports, which does not actually resolve the issue at all. If you purchase the game and start getting the Tarjita-00100 error spare yourself the frustration and just put in your request for a refund.

Additional Edit: For anyone who is having network issues, the following steam guide can help you in attempts to troubleshoot them. In my own attempts none of the solutions worked, but everyone's setup is different.

												Out of the 8 hours ive played this game ive been having alot of fun I play mostly with friends since we have been waiting for almost a year for this game to come out,
 
here are some pros and cons,

Pros,
1 Map is exspansive and beautiful
2 Free to play the missions any way you want and from whatever angle
3 Playing tactically is rewarding and difficult to master,
4 Customazation is suprisingly really good
5 Story is pretty good and seems like it will take a while to complete
6 The abliity to steal any and all kinds of vechicles makes this much better than the division ever hoped to be
7 Playing co-op makes this a much more immersive and way more interesting.

Cons
1 Vehicle handeling is a joke
2 Dont bother with the little bird style helicopters they fly like russian tanks dive bombing the Nazi's
3 The Friendly AI are more of a joke than a help, constantly getting stuck by trees, falling off cliffs, unresponsive.
4 sometimes when shooting out lights the Light point will continue to shine while the light bulb is shot out
5 enemies can somehow spot you in a bush 100 meters out while in a bush at night.
6 If you co-op with less than 3 other players the game doesnt add the extra AI to make it a 4 man crew.
7 Vechicles sometimes load in and clip through rocks trees and other items, (it will launch you to the moon if you get in)
8 you cant jump only vault, and sometimes it means you get stuck on a cliff or rack face that you could easily jump on to 
9 voice acting is subpar 6/10
10 Team based charachter realtionship builidng so far is very bland.


ALSO THIS GAME IS VERY TAXING ON YOU PC
HIGHLY CPU BOUND.

for reference I use 
1 Intel 6600K Watercooled
2 Nvidia Founders Edition 1080 Watercooled
3 16Gbs DDR4 Corsair dominatior plats
4 500Gb 850 Evo SSd

75FPS @High presetting on 1080P 
with some slight stuttering"

												TLDR-8/10 Go get it.
Ghost Recon Willands is a amazing game that has a somewhat intresting plot,fun gameplay and a vast open world to explore. The game features a massive open world where you take down the santa blanca cartel in any way you want anywhere on the map. It allows great free flow as it makes you feel as the master of your own domain. Couple this with multiple collectiables such as weapons,attachments,mementos,audio files and more allows you to always be hunting for or finding somthing. Add fun gameplay with shooting and stealth with optional side missions (that get quite stale as they are all cookie cuttered) and you get a really great game. Overall i would give Wildlands a 8/10"

												Lots of fun solo, haven't really tried with people yet. Just amazing to look at and Ansel images are insane in detail. The game plays well, and although repetative, there's enough diversity in the locations and your approaches that I don't seem to get tired of it. Frame rate also needs improvement. Only getting about 45-60FPS on ultra with GTX1080/i7-7700k at 1440p. Had better frame rate on beta and also controller support... there's something odd going on right now with that.

The AI sucks a bit still and is pretty dumb sometimes, which I hope UBI works on and the driving although fun, has little to no concesquences when you when you decide to defy physics. You can pretty much drive up or down anything, off cliffs, etc and there's no real damage. That would be nice to improve as well.

The one thing completely lacking......in ""Wildlands"" is .... well.... wildlife.... There's a few birds here or there, a couple other mammals in select areas, but you can run km's through mountains, forests, etc and not run into a single animal. Immersion ruined ;)

Good:

-Fun gameplay
-Lots of weapons and accessories
-Drop dead gorgeous graphics
-Very large environment

Bad:

-AI is slow (even your own AI squad)
-Environment can feel empty at times
-Physics are laughable
-Frame rates need working on"

												So i just deleted my first impressions review, here is my final verdict of this game.

Ghost Recon Wildlands is a bold attempt to make a huge entertaining open world experience, but falls flat because of stupid AI, more bugs and glitches than i can count, Bad story, bad voice acting and the same mission multiplied by 400.

Let's talk about some of these things.


AI
Dreadful, just dreadful. The AI can be seperated into two parts, the enemies you fight with co-op players or the AI you have as teammates when playing solo. They are both equally horrible. I mean, we are talking about some all time low AI in a triple A game here. Yes, it's that bad.

The AI can spot you through solid objects, they know where you are if you detonate something remote (like EMP), If one in your squad get detected, they also know where you are (even if you were never detected), They know when you aim at them and when you reload. Your AI teammates and enemy AI sometimes stand right next to eachother without anything happening, they simply ignore one another as long as you are undetected.

The Allied AI can also take impossible shots in sync shots, like shoot through mountains.

This game was made entirely with co-op in mind, making the single player experience really bad. And both in co-op and singleplayer you will quickly notice how the AI basically is ""cheating"".

Making AI impossible to beat is the easiest thing a game company can do, they just give them aimbot and just tell where the enemy is, viola. What makes for a good AI however, is when it is coded so that you almost feel like you are playing against humans. The AI in this game is nothing like human behavior, it's cheating, it's random and a complete mess.


Bugs and glitches
I wanted to wait writing this review until after last days patch was released, so i could play the game over the weekend and see if things has improved. Except performance fixes, i can't find anything they fixed.

This game is filled to the brink with bugs and glitches, and naming all of them here, is not gonna happen. There will be plenty of videos on this soon enough showing how unfinished this game actually is. At an average me and my friends experience about 10 bugs and glitches pr hour of play. Everything from supressors not mounted, missions fail to start, dual convoy missions spawn (same mission twice at the exact same spot), Drones and binoculars suddenly don't work, Animations suddenly stop working, and so on and so on. Seriously the game has hundreds of bugs.


Repetativness
The first 10-20 Hours in this game can be a blast, i had a lot of fun myself. And i also had over 40 hours in the beta. But then you start to notice how similar these missions really are and how identical everything plays out. You travel to a stronghold, or a camp, or a village, and you start laying out your plan. You spot your enemies, you plan your assault, and execute. This is btw the best way to play the game, as it feels rewarding to pull it off.

Go in guns blazing can be done aswell, but it feels very anticlimatic and not rewarding what so ever.

The problem is that this is all the game is. You have side missions that offer you some variation in terms of stopping some convoys, or steal a helicopter or a plane, or drive from one antenna to the other in a certain amount of time. But these missions are also exactly alike in their own respective way.

When you have played for 20-30 hours you really notice this and the game starts to feel like a drag. You just know where this is going, when you travel from one place to the next, there is no ""i wonder what will happen on this next mission"". At best you will be stealing a boat, or watch some politician have sex with a prostîtute through the camera on your drone. This is kinda all the game is. No really unique mission with special types of challenges, all are exactly the same, over and over and over and over.

You go to a place, you mark some dudes, you kill some dudes, you talk to a dude, or you abduct a dude, or you save a dude, then you get XP and unlock next mission. Then you go to a place, you mark some dudes, you kill some dudes, and repeat. Every single time, the exact same thing.

And as you move along you kill underbosses, then bosses, then bigger bosses and then at the end the boss of all bosses. It's textbook storytelling, and basically as boring as it can be. It's mafia III all over again.

And the bases you clear. Well all enemies spawn again just when you leave the area, then you come back, all enemies back exactly where they were last time. If you think of blowing up sam launchers to avoid being shot down in a resource plane you got in a side mission for example, forget it. As long as you leave the area, sam launcher respawns.

The radio in the game plays the same three songs every single time, dialogue between characters are repeated into the state of redicilous. Almost everything about this game spells not finished to me, this game is far from polished and ubisoft should boot their completely useless Q&A team. This game is going to take months if not a whole year to fix.


Additional thoughts
I have had two crash to desktops and one BSOD from the game. None after the patch. The BSOD is the first one i have had in many years, and many other people are also having them. Crash to desktop is common.

Vehicle physics in this game is bad. Especially flying, as you only have left, right, down, up controls. You have no rudder. And you can fly through treetops, and even camp your entire helicopter inside trees without taking damage. Yep, this is one hell of a realistic tactical military shooter allright, i bet Tom Clancy would have been proud.

All in all by now, all this sounds really dreadful, but there are some bright spots as well.


So what is good about this game?

Well the graphics are really good, i really like the map, for the most part that is. Water in this game behaves and looks stupid. No waterfalls for example, ubisoft rather put a river on a 70 degree slope, and the water flows just like it would flat. But for the most part the map is beautiful, huge with nice textures, i played the game on ultra with GTX 1070 and averaged about 55-60fps.

But, draw distance is terrible. Enemies despawn at around 600m. And then being equipped with 50.cal sniper rifles designed to take out targets 1.5-2km away, feels really anticlimatic.

The weapon customization though, is good, lots of options and lots of different guns. Gunplay however is not very impressive.

The settings menu is state of the art, one of the best i have ever seen in any game.





So here are my final words to sum it up.

I have now played this game for a combined time of more than 100 hours including the beta. 66 hours is what i currently have in the finished game. And i am what seem to be max lvl which is 30, i don't get XP anymore. I have all elite skills and almost every other skill unlocked to the max. I have tried this game extensively in both singleplayer and co-op.

So even if the game has it's obvious flaws, it was a lot of fun for the first 10-20 hours, even up to 30 hours. But then the reality sinks in, that you basically bought a huge 60$ map with copy paste missions placed all over it. And a generic boring story at it's centre. When you then include all the bugs and glitches this game currently has, i can not recommend it.

I will probably play it some more myself, i am determined to finish it, even though i can feel the rage building up inside me because of all the problems this game has. But i will keep at it, i can't refund it now anyways. When the multiplayer PVP comes out in a few months, the game might be a lot better, who knows. But right now, no, stay away. If you were planning on playing this game solo, buy MGS V instead, or far cry 3 or something.

In the state the game is in right now. I would say it's worth 25$ tops. Not more."

												Played the game three seperate times before release and i saw lots of progression with fixing bugs and optimization.
If i ever had any complaints about the gameplay, It's Unidad, They are just a faction that either offer a challenge or just chew through your team.

As far as the game runs, I witness microstutters but they don't last long.
Game locks up for half a second every now and then.
Game still needs some more love.

Also on a side note, Even though i made a promise to a friend to wait for him before doing the story,
I still feel overwhelmed by how massive the map is and how much of the map is alive at any given time"

												Wildlands is a tactical third-person squad shooter set in a large open world to use as your playground. It plays as a mix between Farcry, Just Cause and The Division and features 4 player drop-in-out seamless co-op.

The game features a lot of what you would expect - vehicles, guns, stealth, explosions, tactical mission planning, massive world to explore, unlocks and skill points. You are given a wealth of gadgets to help you in your missions which can be upgraded to your liking. The long distance sniper may want to invest some points to steady their aim and improve the drone's range and battery, where-as the commando may want improved bullet resistance, mines, C4 and more grenades. When playing in co-op, you can each specialise in a certain area to improve your team's effectiveness and playing to each individual's strengths. Some other noteworthy skills/features include the ability to call for reinforcements, request a mortar strike, summon vehicles, create diversions, use flares, thermal vision and much more. There is so many cool things to invest in that you are spoilt for choice and invariably want them all.

Although perfectly playable in single player, the fun of this game is when you get a group of friends together for some co-op mayhem. The open-ended ""freeform"" gameplay allows you to approach missions in a number of different ways, depending on your play style. Nothing quite beats the feeling of a well planned ambush coming together when all 4 of your squad are coordinating the fight. Things invariably go terribly wrong too - and trying to claw your way back after a mess-up can be a challenge and rewarding experience too.

Graphically it looks wonderful and the sound is also very well done. Controls are a bit of a mixed bag. On foot, things are largely fine - but vehicles suffer from a few issues. Wheeled vehicles all seem a little too ""slidey"" and the helicopter controls were clearly designed by Satan himself - they are dreadful. To actually be able to fly the thing without pulling my hair out, I had to look online, where I found an awesome explanation of how it works, how to actually control it and how insanely absurd it all is when other games can get this right so often (those interested, check out here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildlands/comments/5w7y8f/guide_how_to_pilot_the_helicopter/). These things you will eventually get used to, but in this day and age, you shouldn't have too. If the developers had put a little more thought into it then it could drastically improve your time with the game.

The game also has a few latent bugs left over (which I am sure will get fixed over the coming months). Nothing *too* game breaking, for the most part. Although one nasty bug in particular plagued our co-op group, whereby a certain weapon unlock became completely inaccessible and required us all to start fresh new games (luckily this happened early on!). If such a thing had happened after 20+ hours of gameplay, I am sure my review would not be so kind. Mostly though, bugs are actually quite amusing - for instance: I was playing single player and was on the outskirts of a main story mission base. I invited a friend to join my game. As they did, the base exploded, completed the mission for me and alerted every enemy nearby. Weird, to be sure. Spazzing helicopters are also hilarious to watch.

The story isn't much good either to be honest. But when the core of the game is all about free-form gameplay and doing things ""your way"", I can forgive this because it is simply really good fun.

The bottom line: Great fun with 3 friends. Anyone that has wanted a co-op Farcry experience may find this right up their street. It's not perfect, but it is a hell of a lot of fun.

Jimbo Rating: 8/10"

Looks great, minor fps issues still linger but pretty fantastically optimized.


I can't tell ya much about the kids difficulties but throwing this ♥♥♥♥ on the hardest makes things pretty intense like realism mode tends to do in Tom Clancy games.


Play with your friends, that was one of the main selling points of the game. Games are boring if you make them boring, stop expecting Call of Duty to come out for the first time again its a military shooter for christ's sake."

												I went in expecting a Ghost Recon game with a more ""Far Cry"" style world. I expected this game to be tactical, challenging and realistic.

Imagine my shock when I got GTA.

I get that we're making video games and all, but stop sticking ""Tom Clancy"" on the front of ♥♥♥♥ when you're releasing gangsta ♥♥♥♥ where you shoot from car windows..

... still, it's a good game. After raging because this is NOT what Ghost Recon should be, I will conceed to a positive review. The game is fun, the squad combat is enjoyable, the game runs well.  Just know you're getting a new GTA game, not a challenging tactical Clancy experience."

												I'm not someone who grew up with Ghost Recon. Wildlands is the first Ghost Recon game I've ever played. I can't tell you whether or not this is a good Ghost Recon game. I can tell you, however, that it is a fantastic game, particularly if you enjoy tactical espionage action. Some elements of the gameplay are rough, but it's obvious to see how much care and attention to detail the developers put into the parts that they thought were important, like the stealth, the weapon and character customization, the landscapes, the gunplay, the setting options, or the enemy AI. It's all extremely fun to play when everything is going well. I highly recommend playing on the highest difficulty."

												First off i must say congratulations Ubisoft for Releasing such an amazing port to PC. A Well spent £40....Please keep releasing stable ports!. After watch dogs 2 i nearly gave up with Ubisoft titles. Ubisoft has amazed me with this release!!!!!. Keep up the hard work. 

Anyway the game has awesome graphics the frame rate on Very high settings hovers around 80-90FPS at 2560x1080p. Incredibly stable and more than playable. Its amazed me how well the game runs even on AMD Graphics Cards. I am currently running an R9 Fury X and the game runs smooth as butter. The Nvidia gamework Features dont effect my gameplay but i see no need for it. The Game has a Vysnc issue and wont run stable 60fps...Pretty Sure it will be fixed. Apart from these 2 little things....The game is awesome and needs to be bought and put into your Steam library. And keep it in your Library for good!. Please Ubisoft keep releasing good ports. I have been a long time fan of your work...But for the past 4 years or so you declined however........THIS GAME IS A SOLID 10/10!. WELL DONE UBISOFT. You deserve a F""""king medal. Is this the start of the upclimb of Ubisoft? I hope so. :)

Buy it...You will be impressed. Contender for game of the year and its only march!. If you dont buy this game....You absolutely suck. And not to mention im Happy Ubisoft has finally released a game which is amazing on AMD cards.I have been super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when a game is dedicated to Nvidia and performance on AMD declines!. 




BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!"

												So far I love this game.  Go stealth or guns blazing.  I kinda suck at stealth so I usually end up gunnin and running, but the job gets done regardless.  I'm getting the hang of helicopters, but shooting accurately with them is difficult.  The game does get repetitive.  The trick is to approach the missions differently or try to change the way you do a mission.  Get creative and mix it up.  There's alot of different ways to do things.  

Your AI teamates can be useful most of the time, but I usually take out the hard targets first (snipers, turrets gunners, etc) before sending them in guns blazing.  Haven't tried co-op yet, but I will cause I heard it's much better.  This is the kind of game perfect for co-op.

The missions where you hijack a convoy can be a pain, but mostly cause my AI teammates shoot up the truck or vehicle you are supposed to steal and blow it up many times.

This game is a ton of fun and deffinitely worth the $60 I paid.  I'll probably get the season pass when it goes on sale.

The only issue I have currently with this game is the bottons and joysticks are sometimes unresponsive.  Im using an xbox one controller."

												PROS:

+ Satisfying weapons simulation
+ Shooting in total just works great
+ Incredibly huge world
+ Amazing multiplayer experience, with emergent game play
+ Love all the weapon unlocks and the Weaponsmith
+ Rich atmosphere
+ Knock out graphics (if you have the hardware)

CONS:

- PC Flight Controls are awful
- Squad AI needs work
- Can get a bit boring when playing single player
- Bullet Drop is a bit too severe
- Still a bit buggy
- Micro-transactions for in game goodies 


All and all, an amazing ""Go visit foreign lands, meet interesting new people, and kill them"" simulation. Off the charts multiplayer experience, with incredible emergent game play scenarios. Shooting is very satisfying, with immediate feedback present. Easy customization of HUD Elements to make the game  into more of a difficult military tac-ops simulation. 

Some for the most fun I have had playing a game in my 35 years of video gaming (multiplayer)."

												tweaked with graphic options for about an hour trying to find the right settings. however for my build i should be able to run it somewhat smoothly on very high, but sadly i have to run medium to high settings. idk maybe its my processor not being the best. no idea. whatever. everyone saying it's like the division. it really isnt trust me, they all say that but really most just dont have the game or they have barely any hours in the div. THEY ARE SO MUCH DIFFERENT. one is an grindy mmorpg. the other is a tactical coop third person shooter. if you play the division and then play ghost recon. there are basically no similarities... seriously. dont compare the two games.

story is shallow, couldve been developed a lot better. 
better with friends(seriously,no friends no fun)
ai is a lil bit weird but not to weird. sometimes it seems like there are some bs moments.
car physics is weird but bearable. we could expect a possible patch.
the controls for helicopters. I personally dont mind them and I could use them well. but i enjoy arma helicopter flying more. that was  f u n.
another positive is seb. dont ask why, it just is
gunsmith pretty aight
charactersmith pretty aight
repetitive but idc really but it triggers some people
i would say its more like fc4/3 they are quite similar but are not the same.
there is a downgrade from e3 build. but it's not that bad. graphics are quite good
this is the most all around messy review i have ever made. idc if it triggers people
would give it 7.5432 chicken nuggies/ 11.65432 chicken nuggies"

												9 out of 10.

These are my own opinions about this game.

So this game takes place in a South America country Bolivia.
Our main mission here is to take down the feared drug cartel named Santa Blanca.
There isnt much of a story but the way you progress in the takedown of cartel is good enough.
Santa Blanca Cartel's leader is called El Sueno.There are 4 branches you have to take down to reach El Sueno and they are Influence,Trafficking,Security and Production.You have the choice to directly go to El Sueno and kill him after you terminate 2 of his branches.For the gameplay all I can say is it could have been better but still it is pretty good after all.There are some inaccuracies with the physics engines but they aren't that much of a problem.I mean which game doesn't have bugs right?

For the graphics you can check out my screenshots and then I will let you decide if it is good or not. 
(Ubisoft made a masterpiece with the graphics,believe me)

For the screenshots,
  http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxrajer/screenshots/?appid=460930&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall

There are loads of guns which you will probably won't use most of them
My favorites are M4A1 and SR-25 and Five-Seven.
I have to thank Ubisoft for adding so many customizations for our like.
Also like Far Cry,you can call rebels for help in combat or vehicle drop but ofc you have to do some side missions for that as usual.
You can ran into enemy convoys with supplies randomly(You can earn rewards for marking the supplies)which is pretty cool.
Well you cant just wait for a convoy to find you,you have to find documents or interrogate specific enemies.
There are medallions located randomly in Bolivia and they give you extra skills(just a little improvement not op).
The way skills work is just fine for a game like this.
Do some side missions earn some skill points that you can spend in different skills.
There are 4 types of skill points which are;
-Medication
-Gasoline
-Food Parcels
-Comms Tool
When you upgrade a skill it will require one of these skill points randomly so you cant just grind for one of them.

There are various vehicles but most of the time you will be using a motorcycle or a helicopter and sometimes a car with minigun when you are with your friends but dont worry,as i said vehicles are various.

For the overall 

Is the game good enough?
-Yes it is great 
Does it deserve 60 euros?
-Maybe"

												I'm 23 hours into this game, 95% of which has been single player, and here's my review

FAR CRY 4 LITE or FAR CRY 4 For Dummies!

And Im not saying this as a negative.  Far Cry 4 was my favorite open world ""conquer the map"" type single player game.

So calling Ghost Recon Wildlands Far Cry 4 Lite or Far Cry 4 For Dummies isn't an insult.

The gun play feels much more simplified / arcade type than Far Cry 4's shooting mechanics.  Obviouisly I was not expecting ARMA shooting out of this game, but I think the devs went a bit too far toward the ""simple"" side.  Example, your AI teammates (again, ive been playing 95% single player) can mark and kill targets that they have no line of sight to.  You mark up to 3 x targets  using your binoculars, and wait about 15 seconds while the AI says its ""getting into position"" (which they really aren't, since they dont need a line of site to kill them), and then hold down Q and the 3 targets are instantly killed, 100% of the time.  Doing this I have seen many times where my AI squadmate shot the target through a solid concrete building :/  

You don't need any of the stealth play either.  While it was fun in the beginning, now Im just trying to finish the game quickly.  You can speed into nearly any enemy outpost, bail out of the car with your un-silenced M249 SAW and clear the place out.  

Tl, dr:
+Fun conquer the map type single player campaign
+large selection of guns for gun nuts
+great graphics

-shooting feels too arcade like / simple
-after a while, it feels like you are doing the same thing over and over again"

												Without playing the beta, and giving into the ""hype"". I came into GRW (Ghost Recon Wildlands) expecting the absolute worst. Ubisoft has always rubbed me the wrong way, and I talked a ton of trash about GRW prior to release, so the only reason I was buying GRW was for the weapon and gear customization, and co-op. When I first hopped in I spent a good 20-30 minutes creating and saving 6 different Ghost kits to my liking. I had heard that the game was extremely easy so I instantly put the game on Extreme difficulty, and haven't changed it since. I then hopped in with a few friends and started playing. I am absolutly blown away, this game has far exeeded my expectations. There's ton of content in this game, and everything you do, from finding skill points, to finding weapons, and attachments are all challenging, and unique in their own way. With over 35 hours played in the first week, I have only beaten 6 of the 25ish bosses. This is truly a great game, but with every great game comes problems. The first problem I encountered was performance issues, on very high I was running at 40ish FPS, and that's extremly unusual for me. So I've bumped it down to Medium for the time being, to insure I'm getting over 60 FPS. The second issue that I had, was that upon re-launching the game, the game would not start. My friend and I both had this issue, and took some time to resolve it. The third issue, is the driving/flying mechanics. They are absolutly awful. The driving is stupid sensitive, and the flying with M+KB feels wonky and awkward, and don't even get me starting on driving the dirt bikes... Over all I am really enjoing this game, I am very picky when it comes to video games, and have never found a game that deserves a perfect 10/10, and that still stays true. I would give this game a 7/10 singleplayer and a 8/10 with friends. GRW could be so much more if Ubisoft would add mod support, but we all know that will never happen. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open world games, and people who enjoy a challenge in video games. But in order for this to be a true Ghost Recon game, there needs to be a difficulty higher than Extreme. Maybe we will see that in the future."

												Here's the deal, short and sweet. There are plenty of things that could have been done better, but I am enjoying the gameplay so far, because the things that I have to complain about are not enough to stop me from enjoying it.

Cons: (AKA stuff that really should not be an issue in 2017)
After you swap your gun for a gun on the ground, you cannot pick your 1st gun up, it just disappears and you have to find a weapons locker to re-equip it if you don't like the new one.

Absolutely god awful 3rd/1st person switching to aim down the sights.

No ""shoulder swap"" button for the camera. I've been ""stuck"" in left handed over the shoulder cam mode ever since I went into cover in a corner, and the only way to change it back is to try to manipulate it back to the right shoulder through the cover mode system.

Terrible vehicle controls. I mean, it's a Ubisoft title, so this is no surprise. When has ANY Ubi game EVER had good driving? Never. But this is pretty bad, even for Ubi. I espected FarCry levels of crappy handling, but this makes Farcry's vehicle handling look like  a racing sim.

Loading times. Now obviously these will vary from rig to rig, but man this is the slowest loading game I own. I can have Witcher III up and running on max and be in-game in about 30 seconds, including splash screens  and stuff, but it took 15-20 seconds for my characters CLOTHES to change in the creation menu. I don't know why, there was virtually no buffer time in between changing options in the beta. Who knows, maybe itll get better with a patch.

Movement feels kind of slow and clunky. I get the realism aspect of it and am really attracted to the less ""run and gun"" aspect, but it kind of feels like you are slogging through molasses. If movement actions are going to be so slow, at least give me like a dive-into-prone option or something. MGS: Phantom Pain brings to mind a really well done movement system. I mean, for pete's sake, you can't even sprint while crouched. I know that you can't really ""sprint"" when you are hunched over, but most games have a ""scoot-boogey-shuffle faster"" sprint for when you're crouched.

And the voice acting/script in general is as bad as all the other reviews say. It's not like they are super bad at delivering their lines, the dialog itsself just seems flat. The voice actors do an ok job considering they are only reading what is in front of them.

All in all, I liked the bit I've seen. Most of the things I have to gripe about is just ""videogame stuff"", that you are going to find pretty much anywhere in games, by and large. I think there are a lot of people who have it out for Ubi, and will never be pleased with anything they release because they have a chip on their shoulder (and with some of their business practices like their pricing structures and DLC sales, I do not blame them), but I try not to boycott entire companies, and evaluate on a more game-by game basis. 

Bottom line, I would wait until this is 50% off or so, because there are other good titles with very similar gameplay for cheaper. I justified speding 60 bucks on this because I needed something new and it was worth not waiting for a sale to come along. I'd say ignore the negative reviews and at least give it a try. Worst case scenario is you refund it."

												Here is my review so far upon Tom Clancy's Wildlands I hope anyone who reads it enjoys and finds it helpful

When this game first came out Ubisoft had stated that it would be ""the first of its kind"" and quite frankly I feel that it has lived up to being that standard. When you first get into the game you get to customize your character to play how you are like most games however you get to cusomize not only your hair your eyes and anything dealing with your face, but you also get to cusomize your footwear, vests, jackets, ect.. which gives the game a little more sense of realism because you change based upon what you are doing. Next what I felt that the customization upon your weapons is extremely realistic as not only are the guns mainly based off those that would actually be used but you get an in depth view of what each add-on will do to each weapon, not only that but they give you a little history of the guns (This is not including all the vast paint styles they offer to truly make the guns your own) and they have every weapon to cater to anyones playstyles whether you want to go loud and proud they have Large Machine Guns, you wnat to be a hunter in the distence- vast selection of auto to bolt action snipers, you want to be a fast close quarter combat person-they have Sub-Machine Guns for you, or if you want to go at that medium range- they offer a nice range of Assault rifles. After you get yourself all primed and geared you should take a few seconds to look at the graphics and how well they made them. Realism was their main goal when you look at the graphics and I for one think they achieved that goal from the way the grass, trees and bushes sway in the wind depending on how strong it is, to the lightning that strikes down on the mountains as it starts pouring rain to even the rain evaportating against the hot roads (I have seen this only a few times during my time playing). Granted not only did I find the things of graphics, your person, and their weapons great but I found the story to be even better. Some had complained that the story would be to short in the beta however, they are far from being correct. The story has you taking down the cartel one faction at a time, each faction however has two bosses one is the underboss and the second is the head of that faction, and before you even reach the underboss you have to eliminate five bonchos (also know as underlings who answer to the underboss). These bonchos will have a set of missions (that you have to find before you can even do them by interogating intel, stealing, or hacking computers) that will range from five missions all the way up to twenty (the best part is not even Boncho will actually end the same way but im not going to spoil lol). Although I love the game there are a few things that could be worked on one of which would have to be the occasional freezing where the game will freeze and have you go to the menu by pressing esc then go back (this might be for certain computers or laptops but a few of my friends have also experienced this so hard to say). Another thing would have to be the long load times into the game itself when you click to start it the game as it's so big it takes a few minuets before it even loads into fullscreen. While this game is still very young as it only came out this past monday night-tuesday I rate it a 8 out of 10 as they clearly spent a large amount of time focusing on realism and environment as well as the enjoyment for the players. I would however recommend that this game should be played with friends and not by yourself as this was a game made to not really be soloed (even when you solo the game you still get 3 ai's that accompany you where ever you go). I would also recommend that people who like games that are open-world, first person shooter/ third person shooters, co-op, or military games should look into buying this game as it accomadates all those and many more.

Thanks for reading and remember ""We are the ghosts who will stop the Cartel"""

												First i would lke to say that this game is nothing like the division.  So many people are giving this game a bad rap, but honestly me and my brother have been playing this game for about 3 days now and its amazing.  we chose how we take our targets down and it only gets more complex as you level up.  Anyone saying this is a bad game is not playing it right.  Also this is a time where good coop games are hard to come by.... i mean lets be real there are no good coop games these days and Wildlands nailed that aspect this game is a blast with friends.  If you dont try to speed run like an idiot and you play the way a stealth ghost recon is meant to be played you will be rewarded. Me and my brother have over 10hrs in the game and are only on the second of 20 areas i let you do the math.  To summerize this game has a ton of content and customization and coming from the corp the military lingo and jokes are pretty spot on.  All in all i toataly recomend this game to any prior military looking to play with friends or brothers."

												This is a game that I feel like people are either going to really love, or really hate. It all just depends on what you are looking for. 

I'm enjoying this game because I can tackle a main story mission and then a side quest or two WITHOUT feeling like I absolutely have to keep playing to know how the story unfolds. It doesn't suck you in to a deep, well thought out plot/storyline, so I have the freedom to just enjoy the gameplay in my spare time without being consumed by it. If you are looking for an epic storyline, this isn't it. I'm ok with that.

I find the gameplay really entertaining. For the most part I use suppressed weapons and try and take out enemies without getting into firefights. Being ""Ghost Recon"" I feel like being sneaky and stealthy is how the game was intended to be played, but it is doable to go in guns blazing if that's your thing. There are some missions that will certainly be ""easier"" to take on in sneak-mode, but you aren't limited to playing one way or another. I'd also add that in most situations, a little bit of recon and planning is always helpful, even if you intend to drive into a group of enemies on a 4x4 with a mini gun and mow down everything that moves. Put some thought into it and work up a plan and things will go better, regardless of if you choose a commando-in-the-shadows approach or rambo-blow-up-everything style.

As I've progressed and made it to more difficult regions in the game, I've found that the objectives can be a bit repetetive (Interrogate that guy, kill that guy, steal that thing, blow up that thing, etc...) However, difficulty increases nicely and there are new challenges that come up as you're out and about taking down the cartel. There are new things like alarm towers, surface-to-air missiles, heavier armored enemies, etc. I find that it keeps the game fresh. It's pretty rewarding to level up your abilities and get access to better equipment, and take down more complex defenses. 

The AI isn't great, for either teammates or enemies. But I don't think it is awful either. There have been times that I just tell my team to ""hold position"" so I can deal with something by myself. Normally they do alright. There are times when enemies are unrealistically hard or easy, but for the most part it's ok if you set the appropriate difficulty for you. 

The world is enormous and looks fantastic. I can't say much more than that. I am running fairly high spec build so I have no issues with frame rate and detail. With an i7-5820K and GTX1070 on ultra settings I get well above 60fps in the in game benchmark (for what it's worth). 

None of my friends have yet to buy the game, so I haven't played with other humans yet, but I can imagine that would take the game to a really awesome level. I don't have much interest in doing co-op with random people I don't know so I haven't tried the matchmaking. 

My gripes thus far with the game... 

-1) The vehicles kind of suck. They are just really hard to control right. I'd say my gaming abilites are average, but it's going to require some patience or someone with above average abilities to master vehicles in this game. 

-2) Less than stellar AI

-3) The shooting from cover system is flawed. I feel like Ubisoft did the cover system really well in the Division, but it sucks in Wildlands. You get your basic ""aim to lean/peek over the top"" functionality, but most of the time it just doesn't work right in fast paced combat and it's annoying.

Overall I give the game high marks. The pro's definitely outweigh the con's for me, and I'm sure I'll get my fair share of enjoyment for the $60 I spent on the game."

												A decent tactical shooter as long as your able to play with friends, can't imagine suffering through a uninteresting story with three AIs constantly getting on your nerves. The game offered around 50 hours of content with two players on the harder difficulty. Playing the game with a controller was great. I'd recommend the game if you enjoy a co-op shooter with your friends every now and then, but paying 50 euroes for the current content is hardly worth it.

The game has as previous reviews suggest some minor bugs, especially regarding phsyics but it does not by any means ruin the experience. The biggest dissapointment is the fact they released a game without it's key features (such as multiplayer) and instead opted to add DLCs straight away. I did not even realize I got a DLC for pre-purchasing, while my friend who did not didn't get it, we were of course disappointed we couldn't play the additional areas together. I feel sick when I check the store, as Ubisoft continues to try to collect every single cent from microtransactions such as xp boosts and other wierd stuff.  I have a very hard time seening anyone actually needing this (except being tricked into buying them) as the level cap is 30 and easily reached before the end of the story missions. Lastly, if someone mentioned end game and Wildlands in the same sentence it probably was a joke.

TL;DR 50 HOUR OF TACTICAL SHOOTER CONTENT WITH FRIENDS"

												It's a mix of Division, Just Cause and Far Cry in my opinion - huge open world. The cool thing about this game is you can pretty much do as you please activity wise. Realism is lacking a bit with regards to ballistics/ disappearing bodies (happens quick enough during some raids that the other targets won't react). However, very fun/ satisfying for those like I who prefer to explore the towns/ side mission style. 4/5 , 5/5 if a patch teaked the aforementioned realism. (Oh and the graphics are outstanding on GTX1060)."

												Please disreard the 0.2 hours on record. I play offline in my office.
Here's a singleplayer review after logging in 15 hours - 
1. The AI is not perfect, but as you level them up, they definitely get better.
2. The AI perform better when given specific orders. Move to specific location works always. 'Follow me' about half the time.
3. The enemy AI always seems better. So better, in fact, that they are liable to see you first most times. Apparently, they   have a sixth sense specially for you, and detect you behind walls and such. To balance things out, your squad can shoot through walls, trees and even entire mountains in a sync-shot.
4. The squad AI pass along a lot of awkward jokes that nobody laughs at.
5. The squad AI isn't that bad, and most times they do detect enemy, and warn you of new enemies along with specific location (""sniper in the tower!""). Weirdly enough, they can mark enemies through walls. 
6. You needn't wait for your buddies to get in a car. They magically appear once you start driving. 
7. Your buddies are huge bullet-sponges. This helps when you are down and need revival. 
8. Also, they cannot take down choppers.
9. Stealth sequences always work awesomely, which makes me think the AI was made with stealth in mind.
Overall, a fun single-player expierence in a keep-your-brains-aside- when-playing way."

												Really fun open world millitary shooter. Lots of bugs and glitches but thats expected for a game of this size still in the first week of its release (although it would be nice if they can be fixed asap because some bugs are game breaking) luckily the game autosaves pretty well so you don't lose progress. Game is also a little repetative but it's fun so doesn't really bother me. Anyway, the game has a huge map with different terrains, lots of missions and side missions, graphics are amazing, and co-op can be fun if you're playing with friends. Vehicle controls are a little weird but easy to get used to. This game really reminds me of the Just Cause series, so if you're into that game you will defiantly like this one. Overall it's a great game with lots of hours of gameplay (about 16 hours in so far and Im probably at about 5% progress) and will keep you playing for hours on end. Highly recommend"

												tweaked with graphic options for about an hour trying to find the right settings. however for my build i should be able to run it somewhat smoothly on very high, but sadly i have to run medium to high settings. idk maybe its my processor not being the best. no idea. whatever. everyone saying it's like the division. it really isnt trust me, they all say that but really most just dont have the game or they have barely any hours in the div. THEY ARE SO MUCH DIFFERENT. one is an grindy mmorpg. the other is a tactical coop third person shooter. if you play the division and then play ghost recon. there are basically no similarities... seriously. dont compare the two games.

story is shallow, couldve been developed a lot better. 
better with friends(seriously,no friends no fun)
ai is a lil bit weird but not to weird. sometimes it seems like there are some bs moments.
car physics is weird but bearable. we could expect a possible patch.
the controls for helicopters. I personally dont mind them and I could use them well. but i enjoy arma helicopter flying more. that was  f u n.
another positive is seb. dont ask why, it just is
gunsmith pretty aight
charactersmith pretty aight
repetitive but idc really but it triggers some people
i would say its more like fc4/3 they are quite similar but are not the same.
there is a downgrade from e3 build. but it's not that bad. graphics are quite good
this is the most all around messy review i have ever made. idc if it triggers people
would give it 7.5432 chicken nuggies/ 11.65432 chicken nuggies"

The AI Teammates in solo are useful

Cons:
The shot register can be an issue, even when you try to go the long shot (500+ Meters)

												Wildlands has you wondering what would happen if you dropped a squad of special forces into a South American country with cartel carboard cutouts with guns? You get a bland lifeless game that's priced to compete with games like GTAV, Witcher 3, Fallout 4, and other open world shooters with far deeper stories, better reacting Ai, and more content. Wildlands is a shallow game that lacks even feeling in its voice acting with your characters slurring out Spanish phrases like politician pandering to minorities. Vehicle handling consists of you sliding around gravel, dirt, and sand like the tires were first coated in grease, and the helicopter/plane flying is clumsy to the point that using any chopper equipped with weapons leads to more collateral damage than any real help. The story is a generic mix of drug dealers that don't seem to have much to them.  Each one presented as worse than the last for comitting the same set of crimes, killing, torture, drugs, and then you move on to the next candidate with the same resume as their predecessor. There's no reason to get this if you already have one of the previous Far Cry games, or GTA if you want an open world shooter, especially at the price of $60."

												Okay well I have not played the initial game itself very much but still I have been following the Beta very closely and grinded countless hours on my console. 

This game for starters has stunning graphics! Amazing open world sceneries, dynamic weather adds to the charm of this game and the robust AI is not bad either compared to many other dumb AI's out there. Anyhow that being said in my opinion the game throw a lot at you in terms of how the in game customisation, and the overall menu and things work. It can be intimidating specially for those who do not like playing mmorpg games.

However, that is a small and perhaps a personal issue of mine, aside that the game does tend to crash on pc a lot more compared to my console. (Note: My setup is beast enough to run this game ultra smoothly). Also the game is not that bad when you play alone with your AI ghosts. In fact a lot of people have been saying to play this game coop which also is fun tbh, but my personal opinion is that the AI is far more smarter than player. Of course compared to a new player! But well with friends we all enjoyed this game massively and I would strongly suggest you to buy this game as it is an all round experience from amazing tactical gunplay, to having an understanding of your surroundings and to know what the objective is. Go in all guns blazing or be as stealthy as a ninja that is upto you. But it is most satisfying to complete a mission without letting any alarm go!

Anyways happy ghost hunting people! BUY THIS GAME!"

Its like far Cry, watch dogs, and a lot of other IP from UBisoft but it plays well, toms to do. Driving controls are ♥♥♥♥♥ like watch dogs. Surprised I had fun, more surprised then COOP is fun. I had it in my mind since I pre-orderd I would refund at 2 hours. Didnt need to. And the in game buying ♥♥♥♥ is pointless for me as I seem to find a lot of stuff just playing. O well.

												Short version:
This feels like the Sonic 06 of the Tom Clancy franchise.
So borderline unplayable yet at the same time a lot of fun to co-op.
The physics and graphical issues should not be a feature.
+ Fun with friends or allies. It's like a game of pickup sticks, but with guns.
+ Sniping. That feeling when hearing that hit mark on a 700m+ shot.
- Everything else. AI, Vehicles, Terrain, Missions, Controls all in varied stages of bugging out, stopping working or breaking in some manner.

RANT AHEAD:
The controls frequently glitch out preventing drone or binocular use. While maybe not controls directly, my character has in every session at some point given up on snapping to cover preventing peaking. Whole game has to be closed down and restarted to fix.

AI is overpowered, dumb or glitchy half the time, spotting you through walls or while directly behind them; enemys spawn in less than 300m from you, including attack helecopters which can then spot you. If 1 enemy spots you, even if you kill them the moment they do before they can react. EVERYONE EVERYWHERE knows your EXACT location. EVEN IF YOU ARENT DETECTED but the enemy is on alert, a silenced kill somehow makes everyone search the location you shot from even if no-one witnessed the shot or the kill.

The pop in is painful and often blocks shots you can't tell are being blocked by non-existent objects. I also feel like since the last patch the pop in got worse?

The alerts are stupid because its not like, oh they've called in support from another base; no just 3 fully loaded vehicles appear instantly at the front gate or quite possibly on the road that just so happens to be directly behind where you were sniping from which was 400m away from the base itself.

This list could go on. Missing out on various mission glitches, the rediculous rebel AI and such but this is enough for starters."

												I am a miltary sim nut. Not the biggest fan of spawn in shooters like COD or Battlefield, though I do like Battlefield 1 for quick action hour fun. Huge Arma and flight sim fan. Also always liked GTA. I thought this game would be like Just Cause 3, but much better. I say Wildlands finds a middle ground between the old Ghost Recon games and GTA. It's a beautiful mixture of the two. Flight physics are good for an open world game. Helicopters basically switch from auto hover to fixed wing once to speed and makes a good transition without rudder pedals. Can coast sideways at slow speeds and believable when engaging a convoy. Squad orders in SP, though primitive actually serve a purpose. Use the ""go to"" and ""regroup"" a lot in a firefight and it has a positive impact. Combat is fun and surprisingly tactical for a GTA style game. World is huge and beautiful. I'm running a GTX 960 with 8 gb ram. I have to keep textures on low but everything else is on and ultra and get 60 fps. JC3 not so much. Customization of weapons and character is large. If you are a military fan and like GTA, this game is a must have."

The graphics are great, as well  as hitboxes. The weapon choices are amazing, they give you a wide choice of playstyle. The approach of the freedom of this game is true to its word. You can do what you want, when you want. There's nothing to hold you back except your own skill and stratagy.

												NOTE: I played the Open Beta when Ubisoft was nice enough to let the general public play.  My total game hours including that are small, but enough to make this review possible by viewers like you.  Thank you.

Ever want the gun customization of Fallout 4 without the ""this just ups damage and range"" and box you into a useless amount of that crap?  Ever want a nearly truly customizable character?  How bout driving UP mountains but not have to worry about committing atrocious crimes all the time?  (well... maybe a little.  ... maybe a lot)

Then Wildlands is for you!

Graphically Wildlands is a very pretty game.  The landscape, though sometimes bland, still looks gorgeous as a mountainous region of Bolivia.  Character models aren't really anything to write home about but I'm not too anal about that.  Gun models, textures, and other small details are gorgeous to say the least and easy on the eyes.

The sound in this game is... well, sound.  It's not fantastic, not poor, but it's there.  Think of GTA:V's ambience since The Division is something we don't talk about.

The gunplay:  The gunplay is what you'd expect (or not) from a Tom Clancy game.  It's no longer in first-person as you might have seen, but AMS IS or you can change the option for a more traditional third-person shooter view.  Personally?  I like the deparature.  Camera angles aren't too buggy, it flows well, and nothing really gets in the way of what you want to do.  Customizing your weapons has a wide variety of options too.  From barrels, sights, stocks, even the ♥♥♥♥ing firing mech you can toy with.  Plus paint, because everyone loves a truly custom weapon of pure death.

Lastly, the co-op.  This game is way more fun with co-op and spreading your mayhem across Bolivia's massive landscape.  I don't need to say much more than GTA: Online's co-op with friends... only if people weren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on that.

												Before everything, sorry for bad english, i will fix it later :)
 TL;DR : is it good? YES ! 

My review : to be honest i was not expecting it to be so good, when i saw the trailer is was like "" meh, probably will get boring .. "" but i heard you can do every mission in either loud of stealth, which for me is a nice mechanic, one day i will feel like going quiet and one day i will want tto take out anger on some cartel dudes.
my PC is really old and most games i play i run on super low, my specs are lower than the minumum and the game runs amazing ! for me graphics were never important.
so about the gameplay, LOVE IT ! i'm a big ARMA 3 player and my dream was a game that i can be a special forces member that i can customize my guns to the smallest part, to customize my character and to plan my aproach to this mission, i finally got what i wanted ! 
there are many mission and things to do, i'm actually really worried i'll die before i'll be able to do everything haha .. 

now to finish my review i have something to say to the internet, i will sound mad but i'm fine with that. 
i am reading way to many comments complaining the the driving is ♥♥♥♥, the AI is ♥♥♥♥, something is basiclly ♥♥♥♥, and you know what? go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, why? 
the current generation of gamers are cancer, dumb and spoiled, when i grew up, if i didn't like something in a game, instead of complaining i was adapting, and overcoming the "" bad "" stuff. 
the driving is ♥♥♥♥? your'e a bad driver buddy.
the AI is ♥♥♥♥? if the AI was too good you would complain that it's too hard and cry about it.

												Very Positive? I'm honestly shocked, I guess I'll be ""that guy""....


Buckle Up Buckeroo.....


In A Nutshell: Wildlands offers a very fun short term experience, especially with friends. Remember when No Man's Sky was getting rave reviews from people who had put hardly any time into it and not even left the starting planet? The same thing is happening here. Ghost Recon Wildlands(GR:W) offers a lot of fun initial experience, the first few hours are a blast when you're not really geared and missions seem fresh. 

After getting the pace of the game things start to feel very bland and repetitive. Yes, you can ""approach missions differently"", I guess? How many different ways can you approach breaking into an enemy base/stronghold? You're still doing the same thing, either trying to sneak in quietly or blowing the doors off.  The outcome is that either you kill everyone off without being detected, or you deal with constant waves of ""reinforcements"" (Ok, if they are cartel, they usually stop after you've killed everyone who knows you are there)


Now as mentioned above, this game is MUCH more enjoyable with friends, I haven't played any matches with Randoms, because why would I? The biggest reason I suggest playing with friends though is because the AI Teammates are LITERALLY USELESS. You are forced into playing the ""Stealth"" approach on Advanced or Extreme difficulty frankly due to the fact that the Enemy AI are 360 No Scoping Aimbots who can detect and find you no matter where you go once they get tipped off, while your team Ghosts will literally stand next to the enemy as the bad guy shoots you to death. DON'T TRUST YOUR AI BATTLE BUDDY!



If you are looking for a ""military"" themed sandbox to mess around in for a few days and that experience is worth $60 to you, GR:W is the game for you, otherwise, it's very very repetitive, the AI is absolutely terrible, the flying controls are dumbed down in attempt to make it so ""everyone"" can use them to the point that everyone is just frustrated with them, the render distance on enemies is VERY short in comparison to the world around you (At 600M enemy infantry models despawn, odd in a game with multiple weapons whose max effective range is more than double that).


Ghost Recon Wildlands lacks any depth and in all honesty, It is The Division with dialed down RPG mechanics and zero depth once you get bored with the same missions over and over and over and over. Of my currently 72 hours played on Day 5 of release (STEAM COUNTS CLIENT RUNNING AS PLAY TIME, dont have 96 hours active play, you tard troll morons) , I would say a hefty portion of those have been just messing around with friends, the issue is there are game mechanics and designs that make even that a pain instead of just being a fun side option. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's the best I can do to sum up GR:W without going super into detail yet still explaining my reasoning, below is a much more in depth Pro/Con & Thoughts


Pros:

- Very Robust Weapon Choices across multiple ""Classes"" of weapon

- Each weapon usually has a large group of choices in weapon parts to further create depth

- The open and hostile world makes for some incredible moments when playing with friends

- The game world looks really great! I'm on a 970 4gb card and running on High it looks pretty great!

- The story, if you pay attention to it all, is actually pretty cool and interesting

- The different game difficulty options scale how nasty the enemy is, not how bullet sponge/weak you are

- Character customization is awesome! I think we waited for almost 30 minutes for one friend on release night because he was playing around with the outfits for so long, best part is you can change your look anytime you want!

- Base Jumping anyone? It's really cool and you feel pretty accomplished when you pull off a short fall jump because it isn't like Battlefield 4's ""You can parachute from anything!"" I've seen so many pancaked friends....full ptsd.



Cons:

- Team AI is absolutely HORRIBLE. Your fellow ghosts will fail to fire, cover your back, anything. They are utterly useless for anything besides using the Mark/Sync Shot exploit to shoot enemies through walls/houses/etc. To make it worse, the games controls were OBVIOUSLY built around console, because to tell them to do anything you have to hold down TAB then use your mouse wheel to scroll left or right along a circle to tell them to Hold Position/Open Fire/Regroup/Go To

- All those Gun choices and Depth are completely meaningless. It all comes down to ""which gun does the most damage and has the largest magazine"". Sniper Rifles are all the same in terms of ballistics when they all have the same parts, so a .50 Cal rifle like the HTI is the clear choice for any long range sniping (The MSR is a close second, but due to the damage the HTI does it one shots Helicopters and most every other vehicle in game) For close quarters sniping (300m or less) one of the high capacity Semi-Auto's works best, however my playstyle is all long range so I just switch to the MSR since the extended magazine for it puts me at 10 and that's more than enough).

- The world is big and beautiful, but it takes forever to get anywhere on the ground, so you need to learn to fly the terrible controls Helicopter and Planes. The controls aren't hard to learn, by the 2nd province I was doing every mission by flying mach 1 up to the target and doing running landings right into the base, the problem is they are SO dumbed down it's frustrating when you can't do what you want. Want to slide/strafe that heli to better land or let your gunners on the skid/minigun take out that vehicle? You can't do that, there's no side to side control, instead the game has Up/Down, Forward/Backwards, and then a blend of Turn/Roll/Slide bound to your A and D keys.

- Dismantling the entire cartel doesn't matter. Even after getting 100% completion with supporting the Rebel forces and killing every single Cartel boss, the only difference in the world is a few more Green dots (rebels) driving around the map, half the time they just cruise right by Cartel & Unidad (the Bolivian corrupt army) forces, so it literally doesn't matter.

- Enemy forces and bases respawn, so added to the fact that there's no real difference to the overall game map, even victories like clearing out an enemy airbase feels pointless, because guess what, EVERYTHING respawns the second you leave the area/render range. 

- Tying into two above points. SAMs. SAMs everywhere. The second you get out of the starting provinces, they are literally everywhere and they lock you regardless of your altitude so the only thing you can do is once you know where they are, try to fly with objects between you when you can, or try dodging the missiles. ""Blow them up FTR!"" Yeah, except when you hunt them all down and blow them up, the second you leave render range, they respawn, so even after you go around finding them all and SAM hunting, they come back the second you leave. Flying in the western provinces (especially the north) is almost annoying enough to make you want to drive 10km instead of fly it.

-Reptitive Missions, everywhere you go, it's the same scheme: Snatch some HVT, Kill some HVT, infiltrate some base without being detected and grab some thing. From the starting province to the last one you complete, it's the same thing over and over.

- The ""call for a vehicle"" rebel perk places your requested Helicopter in the most idiotic places. I've stood on large open flat areas and requested my Vehicle Pickup only to have it spawn on the side of a mountain and then slide and tumble down into something that will snap the rotor blades off the second you get in. Like so many times now I can't even recount.


- UNIDAD: F these guys. They spawn ontop of you and the more you ♥♥♥♥ them off, the worse it gets."

												(I will update this review as I continue playing the game.)

From the few hours (not including my Open Beta experience) I have been able to play the game in my busy college life, I've actually enjoyed the exploration around the countryside and taking in the scenery, enjoying the gunfights, hiding from the cops, and getting myself killed in stupid ways. This game wakes up the numerous nostalgic feelings I had when I played Borderlands with friends and had our hilarious banter in that game. In fact, I've been waiting for this game for months and glad it's out.

I would recommend this game and let me explain in a few points. (Both positive and negative.)

Pay-to-Play System:
Let's be real. A lot of people complains about companies doing this type of paywall on Day 1, but this type of behavior has been allowed for years by other game companies and has been encouraged for years. Many of the options I've noticed were the majority skins for the character, vehicles, weapons and other parts. Not bad at all and I'm perfectly fine with this. Hell, I'm perfectly fine with the EXP boosts in the game, especially since this is a RPG skill leveling system like The Division.

Yet, the part that does tick me off (and what I could agree with others on) about is the option allowing people to skip searching for the add-ons for weapons and some entire weapons. Instead of typically letting players find these add-ons, they allow people pay for a bypass around a hour or two of side content and give them an advantage early on. Luckily, the game hasn't implemented a PvP system, but again--this type of system is quite unfair.


Performance Hits:
Unlike The Division with how clunky it was released, Wildlands has shown to run smooth on my computer. I would get an occasion tear here and there while exploring and vertical syncing seemed to fix this issue, but the biggest issue I had with Wildlands (not entirely sure if it has been removed in the released version, since I haven't experienced it yet) is the CPU leaking / hogging the game would produce. (For reference, I have a i5-4790k and GTX 1070 w/ 8 GB VRAM and 16 GB of RAM.) Let me explain my particular case in detail for you:

In the Open Beta, my CPU locked up to 100% randomly (it normally runs 70~80%) and it was throttling my computer's performance to the point that I had to crash the game in Task Manager to have my Discord run normally again. I thought my CPU was starting to die, but after doing a brief Google Search--I found that the problem wasn't exclusively to me. Other people were having similar issues and it took a few threads on Ubisoft to find a work around.

Overall, I would suggest having a decent computer over the recommended settings before running this game. Sure, it might be a bit of a strain on the GPU, but this game does like to eat the living hell out of your CPU, no matter what you set the graphics settings to.


Vehicles / Roads / Off Roads
Honestly, people need to take it easier on Ubisoft with going more realistic on the vehicles. Sure, they might be too slick or hard to turn on some vehicles, but they're perfectly fine in my personal opinion. This isn't some ""Need for Speed"" game where you can go 100+ mph and think I can make a 25 degree turn easily with the handbreak. 

Let's keep it simple here. The rugged terrain in this game can do major damage to the vehicles and since they're fragile (even the helicopters), I would recommend taking the vehicles designed for the specific terrains, unless you're extremely cautious in these zones. If you're going to be offroad, then get offroad vehicles. Sport cars and large, transporting vehicles need to stay on the roads. Some missions may require you to go offroad or over bodies of water to get to the destination in the limited time frame, so don't get too attached to your expensive, shiny car. 


Story:
This will be updated later on, since I had a friend who was impatient during the Open Beta period and wouldn't let me watch any of the cutscenes. I apologize for not going into death for this section.


Enemy AI System:
If you think you can run into an enemy camp with guns blazing and being out in the open, then you better hope you have an aimbot prepared. Otherwise, you're going down in a hurry. You can get away with this in small group waves of the cartel on the side of the road or rushing the last person, but not in any specific case. The game is designed for stealth, especailly in higher difficulities, so think of using either sniping techniques or going into the base stealth-like. 

The enemy cartel and the police have the same system with minor differences. They both require detection, either by a dead body or standing near them for too long, to engage you and they'll call for reinforcements. They have different variences in their type of enemies, which will show as you go into higher tier zones. Both can be lost if you move away from their detection range The difference between the two is the police won't stop their engaging simply by elimination of their squad, until you eliminate them all stealthly and/or hide stealthly, and base their aggression off of a mark system, which increases as you kill more officers. Higher marks result in higher aggression tactics and longer wait times to lose the police, especially if you hit four marks and get a map-wide search deployed on you.


Multiplayer:
This game is dependent on the Peer-To-Peer system. So, if you don't have a sustainable or stable upload and download speed, then I would recommend another friend or someone else to be the host of your lobby. The game does depend on latency for hit registry, so if you're having high latency, then I would either avoid playing the game with friends during that time or adapt around the latency.

The gameplay is actually fun and highly recommended with others, especially when you have numerous other friends join in on the fun. However, do remember that you and your friends will need to work as a team to complete things. I had things completely go wrong because a friend would blindly run in, thinking he could kill someone else, and not realizing two other enemies are sitting in the opposite end of the room, which would alert everyone in the camp about our prescence. Of course, frustrating if you're tryharding, but this would end up being banter for anyone just wanting to have fun, despite hindering progress. So, this can be a good or a bad thing, depending on your friends and your playstyle.

Content:
During the open beta, I managed to squeeze about twenty four hours of gameplay from two or three zones in Wildlands., especially since I only explored for a small amount of time. There are way more zones in this game than just the three I played in the Open Beta phase, Each zone might be short with the amount of missions you're required to do, but there are tons of side missions that help give skill resources. You can also explore around the map for hidden skill points, side missions, bonus medals (which boost certain skills), and other hidden content. 

If you're going for the story alone, then it'll be short. If you're going for 100% completion, it'll be a while."

												I've enjoyed playing so far. just doing single player with AI, having no real issues with the AI like others. Just be patient, don't go all call of duty on this game. Learn the mechanics and gameplay. Slow and methodical killing and the AI is fine. Give them orders to open fire and they do fine. Sync shots are a lot of fun once you unlock more of them (only 1 to start). 

Love love love the huge open beautiful world, hours will blink bye before you know it.

A couple bugs when you try to create another character (my 2nd character was covered by the menu) and not being able to back out of the character creation screen, but that's all I've encountered. No loading issues, no crashing issues, no rendering issues. 

Overall fun so far and enjoying myself with the game."

												TL;DR: If you got time to kill, why not. Otherwise, wait for sale.

First and foremost, the game isn't broken. So it comes down to whether this game suits your taste or not.While I think the game is over-all well made, in its current state I see three main issues:

1. Controls: This is especially true for vehicles. Cars feel like they are driving on wet or icy road, even when driving on blacktar. Generally, from my limited experience, it seems all surfaces behave almost identical in regards to friction. Further the speed control with keyboard and mouse is as unimaginative as ever. Why not have a speed cap or gears so you can drive slowly while holding down ""W""? Just use the same buttons helicopters use for altitude. Speaking of the devil: Why reinvent the wheel? Helicopter controls have been done very well by games such as Battlefield. Just copy that and there you go. The current controls simply hamper your agility too much and hold you by the hand. 
But these issues aren't exclusive to vehicles. The other biggy for me is how the game handles cover: If the game detects a wall, the character will lean up against it, but as a player you have no direct control over it, as you would have in ""the Division"". So due to its 3rd person nature you lack the exact positioning of a FPS, but there isn't a traditional cover system to compensate, often leaving you exposed and taking quite the bullets. Also, don't try to shoot down form a tower at steep angles. Your guy will just aim into the cover instead of over it past a certain angle(~45°). The whole cover thing kind of leads into the next point...

2. A.I. The A.I. is quite limited to say the least. Mostly in their intellect. I had to interrogate a commander in an UNIDAD base with around 15 enemies, apparently all highly trained soldiers. The base had 3 snipers overlooking the surrounding area. So how do I get close to this base without getting detected?  Shoot the snipers from ~100 meters with an unsupressed M40A5 and have noone in the base giving a ♥♥♥♥. That on 2nd highest difficulty? Basically, if the A.I. doesn't have LoS on the bodies and aren't right next to you when you fire they don't seem to notice. Bullet impacts and soundwaves apparently don't exist. This kind of makes stealth quite easy. 
So how's rambo style? Well, due to the previously described cover system, or lack thereof, you either get shot because of overwhelming numbers, or you easily win the fight. Basically, your skill(besides aim) doesn't matter too much. You can't ""outplay"" the A.I. by using superior cover, fire and movment, suppression, etc. There's simply no depth to the combat. And the A.I. doesn't seem to get smarter. With higher difficulty they just do more damage and take more of it by what I can tell.

3. Lack of character. This goes for the main protagonists and antagonists, as well as the missions. ""the Witcher 3"" is one of my favorite games because the world feels so alive. And because even the side-missions were well crafted and it felt like you actually interacted with the world around you. While this game has an amazingly large and beautiful world, it still feels so empty. The missions are the same basic ""fetch this, capture this guy, hold this position, etc"". Hence I fear this game will quickly become very repetetive. 

And I think it's a great shame. The gunplay feels rewarding, the customization is if anything quite over the top, allowing you to change parts to your heart's content. And did I mention how beautiful the world is? It looks gorgeous. But I fear that none of that will keep me interested in the long run. And so here I am debating whether to keep going or to refund it. This game is certanily worth something. But 60$, plus having to deal with microtransactions? 

Honestly, you are probably best of waiting for a sale. But at least the servers seem do to well and the launch was good. So good on you, Ubisoft. Lets keep going from there and maybe they can fix my concerns with post-launch updates.

EDIT: To clarify: I'm certain this game can be great fun with friends. But at this prize? ""Sniper elite: Zombie army"" is great fun with friends, and is cheap as hell. But if a game is only fun with friends you will often find yourself with no friends playing it. Because you'll only play when they are online, so you have to arrange it. Leaving me with my previous conclusion: The game in its current state probably won't keep me interested on the SP alone, because of which I recommend waiting for a sale."

												This is actually a good game, of course one of the main downsides would probably needing a good PC to run. I use canyourunit to see if my PC is compatible. I crashed to blue screen once when leaving inventory so maybe that might get fixed, Lucky the campaign saves automatically. I use a 1060 3gb which is the recommended graphics and everything else i have is on the recommended list, just a little bug. Overall a good game would 100% recommend, will edit later about gameplay and open worldness."

												I went in expecting a Ghost Recon game with a more ""Far Cry"" style world. I expected this game to be tactical, challenging and realistic.

Imagine my shock when I got GTA.

I get that we're making video games and all, but stop sticking ""Tom Clancy"" on the front of ♥♥♥♥ when you're releasing gangsta ♥♥♥♥ where you shoot from car windows..

... still, it's a good game. After raging because this is NOT what Ghost Recon should be, I will conceed to a positive review. The game is fun, the squad combat is enjoyable, the game runs well.  Just know you're getting a new GTA game, not a challenging tactical Clancy experience."

												the latest instalment of the Ghost Recon series by Ubisoft Is definitely a hit with this hardcore Ghost Recon fan. at times it may get repetitive and the AI team members are lacking in some inteligence. But the game if you can get some friends to play alongside you is great. my co op team has had a lot of fun exploring, skydiving, base jumping, longest shot competitions. our team record is 1.2 km. the side conversations in game are pretty funny too. the ghosts crack a lot of jokes only a service member or a relative of one would understand. they even mention Kozak from Future Soldier in a side conversation.
My ONE problem is it uses up all my RAM i have 8GB and if I play alone its fine but if i open TS to play with friends its only a matter of time till my pc crashes and I have to restart my pc and rejoin.
I would definitely tell my friends to buy this game."

												What do I say about this game...... If you don't have it pick it up NOW!!!!!! The Graphics are amazing, glad Ubisoft didn't pull another downgrade on us. The Story so far is really detailed as hell. Yes, they are a few bugs here and there but easily fix if you know what to do. A lot of people complain about the bad FPS well the way I fixed that (Playing on 4K) is set off vsync and turn on FPS Limited to 60. That will fix most issues. Only thing I can complain about is the ""Physics of vehicles"" other then that the game is one of the best games I've had a chance to play in a while.. If you haven't or are still thinking about getting do it now, the game is what we was promised and IMO it lived up to the hyped."

												One of the best open world adventure game with a huge map probably 3X greater than GTA V . Full of missions which will keep you busy all the time in this open world. Very much tactical gaming required , need much plans for doing missions stealthily and can approach a mission in various ways . Difficulty level hard is fun in playing and gives much of reality and the scenary is just speechless , the graphics they have is just fabulous , feels like real world . But there are some glitches bugs which needs to be fixed as soon as possible and need to add some more activities like racing. They should also increase the survival level in the game . Lots of framedrops also occurs which needs to be fixed . Overall its a nice game to buy and play . Its worth of money if you see the scenary only they have made. Buy it if your pc configuration is good enough to play in high settings."

												Aside from the weird car and heli mechanic it's a really great game, the car mechanic isn't that bad if you have a controller. Also the heli mechanic isn't that bad either once you know how it works and it's coming from a guy with nearly 1000 hours on Arma 3. Though there are so bugs happening to me right now such as freezing 3-5 sec while driving/flying (freezes passengers too) and the low fps i get when there are a lot of Ai around. I get 60-85 fps on low settings, open beta didn't lag me at all, was always on 65 fps on high settings. Hope there will be fixes coming soon, overall amazing gameplay and there's still so much to do and progress.

												Great world, decent AI, Nice variety of ways to engage, Jokes so bad they are good, the freedom is great, and great customization of your gun and character, I also love the stealth mechanics, it can be a challanging game (I'm on advanced so I'm not sure about normal but advanced isn't too much), they also made it so your AI squad will spot the targets on your HUD.. Thank god.. This game isn't for everybody as my friends are torn between ones who love it and ones who don't really enjoy playing it. Be sure to read reviews and watch some videos or something before you buy it, you know."

												A pretty good game. Nothing groundbreaking but nothing terrible. If you're expecting a ""hardcore"" (god I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that term when used in reference to a video game) shooter, look elsewhere. If you want to have a fun TPS and explore, pick it up. I just implore you not to jump on the ""this game is ♥♥♥♥ >:((((("" bandwagon, or the ""this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing"" bandwagon. Formulate your own opinion of it, based on YOUR experiences with the game."

												Before launch I had some mixed feeling about the game considering all the problems I had read about from other reviewers. Fortunately, the game is pretty great. Granted there are some issues I have with the game like the driving mechanics being a little too arcade style and some glitches, but overall I really enjoy the game. I will say to take full advantage of the beautiful graphics you will need a powerful computer."

												At fisrt i thought oh no another open world game from ubisoftt, but then I started playing a bit just to see how the gameplay feels like, and its actually farely decent, they still have much work to put in regarding vehicle controls, but otherwise everything is great, you get tons of tweaks for the graphic settings, the game even lets you run benchmark for your own custom graphic options, and speaking of customization, holy ♥♥♥♥ does this game have it, obviously you dont get crazy character customizations option like an elderscroll game, but the amount of clothes, gears, gun parts you can tweak to your liking is absolutely fantastic.

I recommend this game to people who likes open world and third person shooters, i dont recommend this game to people who wants a great story or FPS fans, it's really different from what you might expect, but overall i have a blast playing it."

												This is the kind of military shooter I've been waiting for: large in scope similar to Arma, but with much easier access and controls. You are free to roam Bolivia and take down the Santa Blanca drug cartel by dismantling its operations in various regions. You will assault bases and outposts, and do side missions for extra resources. You have a good amount of weapons and accessories at your disposal, which need to be unlocked. However, the starting weapons are more than adequate for some good hunting. There's a good amount of clothing and tactical gear options and accessories for you to play around with, each item comes with different colors and/or camo patterns. Can change outfits on the fly any time by going into your inventory. Day/night cycle, and changing weather patterns. Graphics are really nice! Fun times either solo or co-op, but definitely much more fun in co-op, duh!"

												Pleasantly surprised! I was expecting a huge mess, but being Ghost Recon I still had to pick this up. Low and behold it runs great! My wife and I are having fun, but I can see where it can get repetitive to some people. Maybe its because my expectations where so low for another Ubisoft game,  but I dont think this is the case. This game hits the mark when playing coop, strategizing a bit, or just going all out Rambo style if you please.... and if you are having fun, what more can you ask for? As I said before I can see where some people would think this would get repetitive, or that this shouldnt be called ghost recon, but I think we have just gotten so used to hating Ubisoft that they hardly give it a fair chance. If you have a friend or 2, definitely pick this up and have a go."

												I hate buying from Ubisoft like most sensible people, but wow was I impressed.

TL;DR At bottom
The Pros: 
AI listens to you most of the time
Great stealth, very fun to plan strategies
Huge variety of guns, easily changeable for any occasion
Don't have to stealth if you get fed up
Shooting feels generally realistic
Great story and background info on enemies
Loved the case files/videos made it seem real
Story long compared to most games
Huge map tons to explore
Satisfying to 100% everything
Great soundtrack
Realistic gun damage
Able to solo everything
Some very helpful upgrades
Main characters are relentlessly American
Great/hilarious American stereotypes
Nice Character customization
Tons of hours to still be put in
Play style/completion is however you want it to be
Difficulty settings actually get more difficult 
Motivated to complete/take down the cartel
Mentions the Bilderberg group (Its brief but cool)
The Cons:
Enemies respawn at bases you have already wiped out/may have to redo
Helicopter have crazy sight/spotting capabilities (Seriously nerf these ♥♥♥♥ing things)
There were countless times where I was flawlessly stealthing a huge base (Santa Blanca base)
and a Unidad helicopter would fly over spot me and a ♥♥♥♥ing war would break out because AI would start shooting at helicopter, no matter where I was hiding they would always see me
Flashbangs/Drone Medic (and other Drone types)/A lot of upgrades felt very useless (Maybe it was my play-style)
Enemies in cars can see you like helicopters
Some unrealistic base areas | For example: Sub base in the middle of swamp/marsh wetland
TL;DR Overall really great game, just some mechanic issues that can easily be fixed. Especially since the game is very new.
EDIT: As for the performance/framerate/loading issues. I didn't experience any of that. Although I have a i7 4790k and a GTX 1080. Got over 100fps most times I was playing. So sorry to those who cant run, but it worked great for me.

Well done Ubisoft, you didn't completely ♥♥♥♥ing butcher it like most things you touch."

												A MASSIVE open-world game with unlimited ♥♥♥♥ to do. There is never a boring moment. The map is insanely detailed, and insanely huge. Sometimes I like to just stand on a mountain and admire the beauty of the world. The missions can get slightly repetitive, but I try to approach each mission in a different way. You can either rush into the base run n' gun style, or take a very slow and stealthy approch. I prefer the stealthy approach as it provides for many unique situations. The gunplay is incredibly satisfying, and I enjoy the amount of recoil.

The cons of this game were very obvious in my first hour, but after that I started to love it, and the cons began to fade away.

I highly reccommend this to anyone who enjoys stealthy, beautiful, and content-rich games (who doesn't?)."

												so I love this game, honestly one of the most fun open world games I have played ever. It's like a third person far cry with friends and a bigger, more diverse world (and by diverse, I don't mean race, I mean scenery). The only complaints I have is that the gameplay can get a LITTLE bit repetitive and the optimization could be better on PC. I have a i7 4770k and GTX 980 TI, and can run the game at very high (with HBAO+) at 50-80 fps most of the time, but I have friends who have GTX 660s and can't run the game smoothly unless they are playing at 720p on the lowest settings. I also have tried playing this game with a GTX 770, and it was awful. I couldn't get 60 FPS on medium with that card, and same processor. Other than those gripes, good game! Would recommend this, great ubisoft game."

												A decent tactical shooter as long as your able to play with friends, can't imagine suffering through a uninteresting story with three AIs constantly getting on your nerves. The game offered around 50 hours of content with two players on the harder difficulty. Playing the game with a controller was great. I'd recommend the game if you enjoy a co-op shooter with your friends every now and then, but paying 50 euroes for the current content is hardly worth it.

The game has as previous reviews suggest some minor bugs, especially regarding phsyics but it does not by any means ruin the experience. The biggest dissapointment is the fact they released a game without it's key features (such as multiplayer) and instead opted to add DLCs straight away. I did not even realize I got a DLC for pre-purchasing, while my friend who did not didn't get it, we were of course disappointed we couldn't play the additional areas together. I feel sick when I check the store, as Ubisoft continues to try to collect every single cent from microtransactions such as xp boosts and other wierd stuff.  I have a very hard time seening anyone actually needing this (except being tricked into buying them) as the level cap is 30 and easily reached before the end of the story missions. Lastly, if someone mentioned end game and Wildlands in the same sentence it probably was a joke.

TL;DR 50 HOUR OF TACTICAL SHOOTER CONTENT WITH FRIENDS"

												Love this game.  Best open world military sim to date.   (Next to Arma 3)
Military version of GTA.
Detail and quality of gameplay and scenery is definately worth the price.
Game is alot of fun and highly recommend.
I hope there will be more themed games with this style of gameplay: Iraq, Afganistan, Vietnam, World War II.  The scenery is amazing and non-linear gameplay is alot of fun.

Pros
Huge Map.  Game feels bigger than what I was seeing in preview trailers.
Tons of Vehicles to pick from
Detailed weapon customization
Detailed gear and appearance customization
Lots of different biomes. Tons of different environments to fight in. (Jungle, Desert, Frozen Tundra, Urban, Tropical Islands, etc.)
Tons of different unique places to fight (resorts, airports, cities, countryside, jungle, prisons, military compounds) 
Most buildings you can enter and hide.
Detail of environments is amazing (trash, furniture, variety of objects related to place you are in)
Amazing city and traffic lighting at night.  
Looks and feels like a living breathing world. 
Lots of variety of civilian and enemy targets.
Most realistic flares, I have seen in a game.
Dynamic weather environments that change look and feel of each area.
Game is alot of fun when things don't go to plan.  Alot of things get added to the mix, different types of reinforcements, different types of weapons used against you (anti-air missle batteries, helicopter patrols, armored vehicles, mortars, and machine gun emplacements)
Micellaneous events, firefights, vehicles blowing up, helicopter patrols, flares being fired off in distance, all add alot to the game.  Its not always where you are that action is taking place.  Like GTA and Watchdogs you can watch things happen from a distance which makes the game enjoyable. 
Cons
Dead bodies are not persistant in gun battles.  You can snipe AI and bodies will disappear within a few minutes.  Patrols will only detect bodies if they recently dropped.  Once they are gone no suspicion of missing guards or remains cause alarm with AI.
Vehicle physics needs improved. Cars, Trucks, Motorcyles all feel the same no matter what surface you are driving on.  Weather patterns change but, phyisics of vehicles in those enviroments always feel the same.  The physics in games like Watch Dogs 2 and GTA feel more real. Paved roads, dirt roads, mud, snow, all feel the same on all vehicles in this game.
Helicopters are kinda hard to control.  Especially when using fixed miniguns on helicopters.  There is no real way to target or aim what you are shooting at. Alot of times its spray and pray.  Yet AI will shoot you with pinpoint accuracy.
Game needs more variety of AI behavior and encounters.  AI gets very predictable even with highest difficulty settings.
AI spawn out of thin air next to drone jammers if only switched off and not destroyed.  You can stand next to jammer and spawn kill AI for XP.
AI mortars can see you at all times no matter where you hide, even out of sight, or move to different postion.  Infantry will look at last known position you were spotted.
AI encounters feel kinda like Farcry but, with more variety of encounters. (you will find guys by themselves out in middle of nowhere executing people, random encounters along roadside, checkpoints, armed convoys, etc)
Amazing gear detail, although some details were missed: when nightvision is turned on, your character does not wear night vision goggles, same with thermal vision. 
Squad AI will automatically appear in vehicle if you leave them behind.  I assume this is to help incase AI get stuck in environment with pathfinding.  I prefer to wait for AI to add to realism of the gun battles.
I feel like many of the fortifications should be harder to get in to.  I have my AI on highest difficulty and alot of the bases look harder than they are to get into.  It would be neat if they had motion sensors, anti-personel mines, booby-traps.  I feel like the parimeters to many of the military bases would have more patrols or devices to detect intruders.  Especially when driving up to a base by boat.  Many docks are empty, and there are never any boat patrols.  I would like to see improvements to the fortifications so that they feel impenetrable.  Right now it is very easy to trick AI with diversions and pick them off 1 by 1 until there is no enemy left.
Civilian AI are very dumb and don't really do anything but, stand in the way.  I love having them around in firefights as a challenge.  But, it would be cool if civilians had more personality either alerting or informing factions of your presence, or helping you find information about the area.  As of now they see you and will react.  But, enemy AI don't react or get suspicious by civilians if they see you and flee.  Although, they look very cool and come in different varieties, they really don't do much.  In real life civilians disappear when firefight is about to take place, in south america kites are flown as signals to warn the cartels of police, things like this would add alot to this game.
Faction Behavior is strange at times.  I have seen Unidad Army and Rebel Forces hangout together.  I have seen Unidad Army and Santa Blanca Cartel hangout together.  Then as soon as you appear on scene the Unidad attack you, and then the rebels will attack Unidad.  I have also seen Rebels drive next to Santa Blanca Cartel and not do anything to each other.  Cartel seems to not mind the Rebels and the Rebels don't mind the Cartel.  But, as soon as someone detects you, the fight begins."

												Oh you better be prepared for one of the most beautifully rendered games I've ever seen games i've ever played. I'm so gladi finally joined the PC Nation. There are a few issues but small ones like, while playing around in this spectacularly massive open world, while driving my 1st vehicle I noticed that you dont leave your own tracks in the mud. And it would really have been awesome if you could individually control your team. it's kind of annoying when you cant set each of your team around an objective so you can coordinate your attack better. I've had quite a few times where my guys aren't so bright and get seen while making their way to thei waypoint.  Also my 1st game in 4k and it was worth it, its like playing a movie...literally it looks that awesome! so much detail i was so...in AWE that i didn't even play for the 1st hour and change i walked and drove around checking out the beautiful views, And configuring my system to run ultra settings on 1 EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 SC at between 40 to 60 fps. This game takes alot to run. I heard from some ""professionals"" that it looks better to run a game on 1080p at ultra settings, than 4k on very high, or even high. Those men, are either BLIND! Or they...I don't actually know why else they would say it looks better at 1080p, it just doesn't...I just need to find a group of players that wants to play like i do...Tactically silent. And coordinate our shots so we are in and out and we leave only corpses behind. Apparently there's alot more players that wanna go in balls deep, than a coordinated attack. i highly recommend this game for sure. 120%. This will be my go to game for a while"

												I don't usually pay full price for a game without Fallout in the title, but retail therapy is what it is. GR:W is a typical Ubi game in the sense of repetition with regards to uncovering map areas, side missions, climbing towers, looting collectibles. It plays like a cross between Far Cry and The Division, with elements of Just Cause. It's very satifying to take down a compound with three friends over voice chat (as with any game TBF). 

The combat is very tight, and the guns feel powerful and responsive. The driving is skewy at best. I've found it much easier to use a controller for air vehicles. The ground vehicles handle pretty well, and are a lot of fun. The AI is pretty on par, much better than say L4D bots, though I've noticed it doesn't always get out of the way of a blast radius. The skill tree is very compact, yet still accessible, but doesn't lead to any branching characters with regards to replayability (at least unique replayability). Character customisation options are varied, you're sure to find an avatar you like. The specialised PC GFX options are much appreciated in this day and age, especially on a multiplatform release, and especially as I've just bought a new rig with a 1080. 

I like the game and I'm going to complete it, so I'm going to get my money's worth. Not sure about the DLC at this stage.

Bugs I've noticed after 20 hours: 

- One where I suddenly couldn't use binoculars or a drone; Restarting solved the problem. 
- One where I accidentally destroyed a supply convoy, but was still able to GPS-tag the wrecked car for rebel pickup. 
- If you smash the headlights on your car, the lightbeams still project onto the road. It's far easier to drive with NVG at night, so removing that really wouldn't cause a problem to the player (even though NVG is an unlockable skill). It's just weird looking back at the front of your vehicle and seeing smashed headlights projecting light.
- Another, not really a bug, but I got stuck in a hole reconning a compound, I had to fast travel out and restart the assault (troops had respawned). 

For the size, scope and quality of the game, these are fine IMO.

Couple tips I wish I'd have learned earlier:

- Max Sync Shot early. It means your team can take out four targets simultaneously.
- Even if you don't use stealth, using your binoculars and drone will help you recon and give you exact enemy positions.
- Use the radial menu to control the AI. They're pretty good, but sometimes need a hand.
- Prioritising choosing skill point and weapon locations when scouting intel will make it a lot easier to level up
- Make sure you're away from roads when reconning. Several times I have been spotted and engaged by a simple gang car driving by on a road, which in turn enrages the base. I'm also terrible at games, so this one may not be a prolem for you.
- Always drive off. The AI will teleport into however many free seats are in your vehicle (up to three obv). It's a little immersion-breaking, but it's far better (read: fun) than waiting for three separate bots to get in three separate doors before you even think about accelerating away.

Final line: It's a very good game, and if you can forgive Ubisoft tropes, it's a great game, and it's even better in MP."

												Stop trying to compare to other games, it's not other games, it's Ghost Recon, regardless if you try to play it like other games. Just because the game gives you the freedom to sprint around and shoot everything like Far Cry doesn't mean that you have to or that you should. Though it's completely playable in singleplayer, like many other games( such as Left 4 Dead, Borderlands, Mario Party, Smash Bros., The Division, etc. ) it truly shines when you are playing with friends, and that is a fact. BUY SOLO AT YOUR OWN RISK. Solo teammate AI is not the best and it is obvious that this game was meant to be played with coordinating human players.

The vehicle controls are clunky. The story and dialogue are terrible to the point where I want to mute my audio sometimes (as a veteran, it is cringeworthy to listen to these ""operators"" conversations). The AI bugs out every now and then, though for the most part things go the way they are supposed to.

But, I don't play Ghost Recon for vehicles, nor do I play Ghost Recon for deep plots and characters, and I don't think I've ever played a bug-free Tom Clancy title in my life. I play Ghost Recon to immerse myself in tactical scenarios, which is much more fun to do now that the focus is on freedom of choice (similar to OGR and its expansions) rather than linear, set-piece focused missions( like in GRAW or Future Soldier). Judging by how dead the multiplayer still is for OGR, I'm guessing most people only recognize GRAW and onward as Ghost Recon. But trust me when I say that freedom of choice and approach in your missions is a step back in the right direction for the series. OGR dropped you into a map, gave you some objectives, and let you decide how to move through and complete them. Although it no longer has the forced tactical elements of the original series (i.e. bullets don't spray out randomly in all directions from your gun when you shoot on the move like in OGR) If you have a tactical mindset and are willing to put in the patience and effort required of tactical shooters, then this game is for you. If you're looking for a Far Cry/GTA/Just Cause ripoff, then you'll probably get bored very quickly.

												Lets admit it guys, we all hate UBISOFT products with all our hearts , in my opinion the only good games they have are Black Flag , Rainbow 6 Siege and THIS. 
And heres why! (resumed)

Pros:

-Super Fun alone or with friends
-NPCs dont ♥♥♥♥ up the missions and actually know who to shoot
-Good Graphics (altough its been downgraded as always)
-Huge map
-Variety of biomes.
-Awsome weapon costumization.

Cons:

-Downgraded graphics.
-Network system.
-Glitchy(?) NPCs getting in cars while in missions.
-Multiple Glitches.
-Bad Rendering in caves/roads etc..

Overall i love this game really much , its fun , good story (not the best but still fun) and amazing coop sessions with the lads!"

												1st review EVER, out of probably 100 games.   I expect that I'll get some hate from this review, but whatever. 

I've only played for 10 or so hours, but from that I can tell you that  I like the game, but I definitely do not love the game.   I'll try to sum up some issues below. 

The Good:

This game is a large, beautiful open world game.   The game adapts, and changes to reflect things that you've done within the game.    The 1st person view while looking down the scope is perfect.   Also just when you think that the game's starting to get repetitive, it throws you a curve ball.   WIthout spoiling anything, the enemy becomes more challenging.  These are all great things!   The game is fun to play, even with it's quirks which I'll try to mention some of my findings below. 


The Bad:

The game needs work.   Playing with bots alone comes with a large learning curve.  The bots hang way behind you, and the only way to get support from them is to either die, or to have them take the shot by using SYNC command.   It's taken me a bit to make this my game style.  This is fine, but be keep track of who you have SYNC set for, and don't forget to only take your shot when all of the SYNC targets, and YOUR target are away from anyone else, to not alert other enemies.   I made the mistake a few times of thinking only the keybinding (Q) was to initiate the SYNC take down command, and the bots take their shots when I fired my rifle at someone who was away from else.  Bad move because it can ruin the mission by alerting everyone else around them.

Another issue I had with the game is that for some missions it doesn't show a countdown timer on timed missions. I sometimes don't know whether it's a timed mission, or not until it's too late.   I  get caught off guard with a bot saying something about 'do you think we'll make the time limit' when you're running low on time, and by then it's already too late.  I've gotten use to looking for supplies right after completing the area, before attacking the 2nd target.  It's not obvious that there's a 2nd target until after you've completed the 1st one.  The missions don't seem to be replayable if you fail them.  I've been alt+F4 before it saves so I can replay them. 


The Unfortunate:

I bought the game full price through Steam so I could play with people on my Friends List.   Once installed, the game redirected me to Uplay, and you're logged in through UPlay, and cannot see your Steam Friends List.  At least that's how it works from what I can tell. 



Other Thoughts:

If you have people on your UPlay friends list, and can play Co-Op, the game will be much more fun than single player.  Playing with randoms will not make the game any better.   They will revive you about as much as I revive bots.   The game as single player is still fun, but it can be very frustrating. 

Playing solo can be very challenging, which is both good and bad.  

I honestly wish the whole game was 1st person, instead of 3rd person with 1st person view while aiming.  I don't normally play 3rd person games and get caught walking off of stairwells.   This definitely isn't a flaw of the game, more that I wish you could have the option of playing 1st or 3rd person view.   

If you're planning to play this game solo, wait for the price to drop some."

												I recommend this game to anyone!

I cant find fault in it so far. I played the betas and covered the entire playable area. Performance has increased a bit since then. I'm able to get a solid 50 fps on High with my gtx780, cant wait to upgrade for even better perfomance.

The only thing so far that i would say needs to be changed is that when you are in a party of players, is that the resources tagged is done for he entire party and not each individuel tagging the same crate over."

												This is honestly fun coming from a guy who has never played any of the previous Ghost Recon games. Granted that this is one day after the release of the game, there are many occasions when the frame rate drops, but never below 30. This is at the medium preset with an Intel Core i7 6700, 16 GB of RAM, and my GTX 1060 3GB that I have overclocked. There are still some performance issues, but I would recommend because this is the experience I have never before seen and felt in any other games that I've played."

												Chicken's explode when you shoot them.

11/10 would shoot a chickenbomb again.

In all seriousness though, this game is amazing. No performance issues, on my dated i5 3570k, with GTX970 and 16gb Ram, on an SSD with Windows 8.1. The world is beautiful, everything works and I am quite honestly surprised how decent the game is. Will be playing it a lot for the forseeable future. 

If you are even remotely interested in this game (and you meet the PC req's) buy it, it's a no-brainer. Ubisoft has delivered.

EDIT 12/03/17: With the latest update, a minor freezing issue I had is non-existant. It was an i5 problem, and not my internet, that was solved 100%. Game is running even better :)

Don't listen to reviews from people with less than 5 hours or even under 10, there is so much depth to this game that people won't see unless they have played more. For example, at night the guards in a base go to bed/sleep leaving minimal security to defend themselves. It's not perfect, but then show me a game that is. The views are fantastic and exploration on the bike can keep you busy for ages.

As you progress through the skill tree, certain tasks become easier and your team becomes stronger. You have so many options available to you.

I apologise that this isn't the best written review but perhaps I will rewrite it after I have played a bit more as I am still NOWHERE near complete after almost 60 hours."

												Played this game for 6hours today and i can only say that this game is amazing! This game have huge Map and amazing graphics and stealth gameplay. You can unlock new guns and attachments and different explosives. Ubisoft should fix some little bugs but today was release day so its normal that game have some bugs after release. I think that driving is horrible but luckily you can use helicopter or plane! Poor performance is again problem like in Watch Dogs 2 because i get only 60-80 FPS on 1080p with i7-6700k and GTX 1070. Ill give 9/10 to this game."

Played co-op even only 2 man is where this game really shines.

I also reccomend each player takes a designated role.

Support/Drone Operator/Pilot
Sniper/Long Range Cover
Demolitions
Point man

Played like this (especially if you assume the pilot is the only one who knows HOW to pilot)

Makes the game even more interesting."

												My personal cons with the game are the vehicle & air mechanics. You can't elevate and go forward at the same time when you're in a helicopter, very frustrating. You seem to also plummit to the ground just by tapping CRTL. 

Vehicle mechanics are really odd too, It feels as though you're on ice when it's raining or on dirt/mud. The vehicles feel light, they seemed to have rushed the Vehicles in this game, which is a shame when you have such a diverse and creative game with so much to offer the player.  

Gun play in my eyes seems just like Far Cry, they're a bit too similar. They should of taken the The Last Of Us route and made the engine a bit slower for nice comfortable stealthy operations. But the game has it's pros; Crazy customisations from gun attachments, to gun skins. There is a deep deep storyline with so much for the player to do which is great with a small party of friends. Visually this game is stunning, so many different climates to explore.

I just wished they would of spent more time on Vehicle mechanics. I hope they have a future update that changes some aspect of the vehicles, especially Helicopters & Cars/SUVs.

- For a good group of friends i would strongly recommend this game!"

												Stop trying to compare to other games, it's not other games, it's Ghost Recon, regardless if you try to play it like other games. Just because the game gives you the freedom to sprint around and shoot everything like Far Cry doesn't mean that you have to or that you should. Though it's completely playable in singleplayer, like many other games( such as Left 4 Dead, Borderlands, Mario Party, Smash Bros., The Division, etc. ) it truly shines when you are playing with friends, and that is a fact. BUY SOLO AT YOUR OWN RISK. Solo teammate AI is not the best and it is obvious that this game was meant to be played with coordinating human players.

The vehicle controls are clunky. The story and dialogue are terrible to the point where I want to mute my audio sometimes (as a veteran, it is cringeworthy to listen to these ""operators"" conversations). The AI bugs out every now and then, though for the most part things go the way they are supposed to.

But, I don't play Ghost Recon for vehicles, nor do I play Ghost Recon for deep plots and characters, and I don't think I've ever played a bug-free Tom Clancy title in my life. I play Ghost Recon to immerse myself in tactical scenarios, which is much more fun to do now that the focus is on freedom of choice (similar to OGR and its expansions) rather than linear, set-piece focused missions( like in GRAW or Future Soldier). Judging by how dead the multiplayer still is for OGR, I'm guessing most people only recognize GRAW and onward as Ghost Recon. But trust me when I say that freedom of choice and approach in your missions is a step back in the right direction for the series. OGR dropped you into a map, gave you some objectives, and let you decide how to move through and complete them. Although it no longer has the forced tactical elements of the original series (i.e. bullets don't spray out randomly in all directions from your gun when you shoot on the move like in OGR) If you have a tactical mindset and are willing to put in the patience and effort required of tactical shooters, then this game is for you. If you're looking for a Far Cry/GTA/Just Cause ripoff, then you'll probably get bored very quickly.

												First impressions after 2 hours are good. The game sort of reminds me of Arma, but with a much easier go of it and a bit more polished. I really like the binoculars and drone use, as well as the stealth options and nightvision. The game runs very smoothly for me and without any frame issues so far for my I7 3770 - MSI GeForce GTX 1060 rig. Driving on the road seems a bit unpolished, but its not completely bad. The Bolivian drivers will all cower in fear a bit too much, but thats not that bad either. For the most part I think its a fun game... not sure if it will be a long lasting one, but a good one. Controls are mapped out very well and quick to learn as well. 

Whoa.. its a lot of fun. Seems the motorcycles are the best way to get around.  :D"

												Wildlands has you wondering what would happen if you dropped a squad of special forces into a South American country with cartel carboard cutouts with guns? You get a bland lifeless game that's priced to compete with games like GTAV, Witcher 3, Fallout 4, and other open world shooters with far deeper stories, better reacting Ai, and more content. Wildlands is a shallow game that lacks even feeling in its voice acting with your characters slurring out Spanish phrases like politician pandering to minorities. Vehicle handling consists of you sliding around gravel, dirt, and sand like the tires were first coated in grease, and the helicopter/plane flying is clumsy to the point that using any chopper equipped with weapons leads to more collateral damage than any real help. The story is a generic mix of drug dealers that don't seem to have much to them.  Each one presented as worse than the last for comitting the same set of crimes, killing, torture, drugs, and then you move on to the next candidate with the same resume as their predecessor. There's no reason to get this if you already have one of the previous Far Cry games, or GTA if you want an open world shooter, especially at the price of $60."

												the latest instalment of the Ghost Recon series by Ubisoft Is definitely a hit with this hardcore Ghost Recon fan. at times it may get repetitive and the AI team members are lacking in some inteligence. But the game if you can get some friends to play alongside you is great. my co op team has had a lot of fun exploring, skydiving, base jumping, longest shot competitions. our team record is 1.2 km. the side conversations in game are pretty funny too. the ghosts crack a lot of jokes only a service member or a relative of one would understand. they even mention Kozak from Future Soldier in a side conversation.
My ONE problem is it uses up all my RAM i have 8GB and if I play alone its fine but if i open TS to play with friends its only a matter of time till my pc crashes and I have to restart my pc and rejoin.
I would definitely tell my friends to buy this game."

I crashed to blue screen once when leaving inventory so maybe that might get fixed, Lucky the campaign saves automatically. I use a 1060 3gb which is the recommended graphics and everything else i have is on the recommended list, just a little bug.

												GTA meets the Division. Single player is ok. It can be done. This game shines in multiplayer. I have not had this much fun running around with friends in a game in years. Some games are just a grind.  Last night I finally looked up and noticed I had over 20 skill points to apply. I was not even concerned about leveling up. It was more about the gameplay. I enjoyed sneaking around. Taking out guards one at a time while communicating with my friends on who had which targets. I had a buddy sit overwatch to guard my back while I made my way through the city. Then I heard a thud. My buddy had sniped a guard next to me that I had not noticed. Fantastic game. Enjoy it with friends."

												I wasnt really expecting much when i heard about this game, so my expecations for this game were very low. And so when i started to play this game i was suprised at what it offered. The optimzation for this game is alright. This game is really what i wanted, a chill game to pick up and shoot some mexicans. The game mechanics are eazy to get use to like the over sensitive veehicles or the awkard flying but after awhile u will get use to it. Thia game is clearly not for everyone its like if farcry has sex with the divison and gtav. All in all its a fun a entertaining game and i would recommend this to anyone that wants a casual/arcade type shooter to play with some friends. I would rate it a 7/10"

												First of all the game is a blast to play. The combat is fun and engaging, not to mention very satisfying. There are lots of activities to do, and lots of guns and skills to unlock. It feels very rewarding getting better guns in the harder areas, as well as receiving special weapons from taking down bosses. 

The graphics are great. And as far as I can tell, the game on all ultra looks identical to the E3 gameplay we saw a year or two back, minus a few animation changes and less scripted situations. Normally in a game with a map this big, you'd think it'd be a burden to just walk to certain waypoints, but in this game its very enjoyable and really immersive to just hike through the dense jungles or through the towns and villages.

We also practically got exactly what was advertised as well. Ubisoft stuck with their word and dropped a very good, not downgraded game which is exactly how it should be. 

The micro-transactions don't bother me at all. I haven't felt forced at all to buy some credits and spend it on weapon attachments, since everything is attainable in game without too much difficulty. I guess it works out if you're lazy. Most of the other items are purely cosmetic, so to each their own. 

The vehicle controls could use some work, I see that it tends to be the main issue everyone has with the game, but it isn't game breaking. The controls are somewhat sensitive but they can be adjusted so youre not constantly tapping the A and D keys just to turn. I suggest just sticking to main roads unless you have a dirt bike or dunebuggy, otherwise you wont have a very good time driving off road :P

Other then that, it's an awesome game, and I'd say its worth the money."

												So i just deleted my first impressions review, here is my final verdict of this game.

Ghost Recon Wildlands is a bold attempt to make a huge entertaining open world experience, but falls flat because of stupid AI, more bugs and glitches than i can count, Bad story, bad voice acting and the same mission multiplied by 400.

Let's talk about some of these things.


AI
Dreadful, just dreadful. The AI can be seperated into two parts, the enemies you fight with co-op players or the AI you have as teammates when playing solo. They are both equally horrible. I mean, we are talking about some all time low AI in a triple A game here. Yes, it's that bad.

The AI can spot you through solid objects, they know where you are if you detonate something remote (like EMP), If one in your squad get detected, they also know where you are (even if you were never detected), They know when you aim at them and when you reload. Your AI teammates and enemy AI sometimes stand right next to eachother without anything happening, they simply ignore one another as long as you are undetected.

The Allied AI can also take impossible shots in sync shots, like shoot through mountains.

This game was made entirely with co-op in mind, making the single player experience really bad. And both in co-op and singleplayer you will quickly notice how the AI basically is ""cheating"".

Making AI impossible to beat is the easiest thing a game company can do, they just give them aimbot and just tell where the enemy is, viola. What makes for a good AI however, is when it is coded so that you almost feel like you are playing against humans. The AI in this game is nothing like human behavior, it's cheating, it's random and a complete mess.


Bugs and glitches
I wanted to wait writing this review until after last days patch was released, so i could play the game over the weekend and see if things has improved. Except performance fixes, i can't find anything they fixed.

This game is filled to the brink with bugs and glitches, and naming all of them here, is not gonna happen. There will be plenty of videos on this soon enough showing how unfinished this game actually is. At an average me and my friends experience about 10 bugs and glitches pr hour of play. Everything from supressors not mounted, missions fail to start, dual convoy missions spawn (same mission twice at the exact same spot), Drones and binoculars suddenly don't work, Animations suddenly stop working, and so on and so on. Seriously the game has hundreds of bugs.


Repetativness
The first 10-20 Hours in this game can be a blast, i had a lot of fun myself. And i also had over 40 hours in the beta. But then you start to notice how similar these missions really are and how identical everything plays out. You travel to a stronghold, or a camp, or a village, and you start laying out your plan. You spot your enemies, you plan your assault, and execute. This is btw the best way to play the game, as it feels rewarding to pull it off.

Go in guns blazing can be done aswell, but it feels very anticlimatic and not rewarding what so ever.

The problem is that this is all the game is. You have side missions that offer you some variation in terms of stopping some convoys, or steal a helicopter or a plane, or drive from one antenna to the other in a certain amount of time. But these missions are also exactly alike in their own respective way.

When you have played for 20-30 hours you really notice this and the game starts to feel like a drag. You just know where this is going, when you travel from one place to the next, there is no ""i wonder what will happen on this next mission"". At best you will be stealing a boat, or watch some politician have sex with a prostîtute through the camera on your drone. This is kinda all the game is. No really unique mission with special types of challenges, all are exactly the same, over and over and over and over.

You go to a place, you mark some dudes, you kill some dudes, you talk to a dude, or you abduct a dude, or you save a dude, then you get XP and unlock next mission. Then you go to a place, you mark some dudes, you kill some dudes, and repeat. Every single time, the exact same thing.

And as you move along you kill underbosses, then bosses, then bigger bosses and then at the end the boss of all bosses. It's textbook storytelling, and basically as boring as it can be. It's mafia III all over again.

And the bases you clear. Well all enemies spawn again just when you leave the area, then you come back, all enemies back exactly where they were last time. If you think of blowing up sam launchers to avoid being shot down in a resource plane you got in a side mission for example, forget it. As long as you leave the area, sam launcher respawns.

The radio in the game plays the same three songs every single time, dialogue between characters are repeated into the state of redicilous. Almost everything about this game spells not finished to me, this game is far from polished and ubisoft should boot their completely useless Q&A team. This game is going to take months if not a whole year to fix.


Additional thoughts
I have had two crash to desktops and one BSOD from the game. None after the patch. The BSOD is the first one i have had in many years, and many other people are also having them. Crash to desktop is common.

Vehicle physics in this game is bad. Especially flying, as you only have left, right, down, up controls. You have no rudder. And you can fly through treetops, and even camp your entire helicopter inside trees without taking damage. Yep, this is one hell of a realistic tactical military shooter allright, i bet Tom Clancy would have been proud.

All in all by now, all this sounds really dreadful, but there are some bright spots as well.


So what is good about this game?

Well the graphics are really good, i really like the map, for the most part that is. Water in this game behaves and looks stupid. No waterfalls for example, ubisoft rather put a river on a 70 degree slope, and the water flows just like it would flat. But for the most part the map is beautiful, huge with nice textures, i played the game on ultra with GTX 1070 and averaged about 55-60fps.

But, draw distance is terrible. Enemies despawn at around 600m. And then being equipped with 50.cal sniper rifles designed to take out targets 1.5-2km away, feels really anticlimatic.

The weapon customization though, is good, lots of options and lots of different guns. Gunplay however is not very impressive.

The settings menu is state of the art, one of the best i have ever seen in any game.





So here are my final words to sum it up.

I have now played this game for a combined time of more than 100 hours including the beta. 66 hours is what i currently have in the finished game. And i am what seem to be max lvl which is 30, i don't get XP anymore. I have all elite skills and almost every other skill unlocked to the max. I have tried this game extensively in both singleplayer and co-op.

So even if the game has it's obvious flaws, it was a lot of fun for the first 10-20 hours, even up to 30 hours. But then the reality sinks in, that you basically bought a huge 60$ map with copy paste missions placed all over it. And a generic boring story at it's centre. When you then include all the bugs and glitches this game currently has, i can not recommend it.

I will probably play it some more myself, i am determined to finish it, even though i can feel the rage building up inside me because of all the problems this game has. But i will keep at it, i can't refund it now anyways. When the multiplayer PVP comes out in a few months, the game might be a lot better, who knows. But right now, no, stay away. If you were planning on playing this game solo, buy MGS V instead, or far cry 3 or something.

In the state the game is in right now. I would say it's worth 25$ tops. Not more."

EDIT: after spending more time into the game and realizing that it took me 4 hours to semi complete and entire provice i learned that i will not be able to finish this game quickly unless i just go for main missions. so far it is still a great buy."

												After playing for a few hours it is clear that some major improvments over the beta have been made, especially to the connectivity and driving controls. The game has a few bugs and glitches and has performance issues but the gameplay and world design make up for it and i would definatly recomend this game to anyone with a GPU with 4GB VRAM or more. If you have less than 4gigs you may not be able to run the game at very high settings as the game is quite demanding due to its size and scope. I will update this if anything changes but so far its the best coop open world game i have played in years."

												Ghost Recon Wildlands is attempting to mix so many games for it's own good.

BUT, it manages to do what it does have rather nicely.

 Pros 

Good Graphics
Great multiplayer fun
Interesting story
Has a decent amount of humor here and there. (Especially the General joke, told pretty early on)

 Cons 

Blatantly broke AI (Reference video below)
Stealth mechanics need work
As mentioned prior, AI needs work.
Basically required to play online for a non idiot AI experience
Pleeenty of bugs. (But we are Day 1 release)


 Story 
You are a member of a 4 member 'Ghost' squad, employed to bring down the Santa Blanca cartel, located in Bolivia, that has kidnapped, murdered, and overall has created chaos, you will accomplish this mission by bringing down the leaders of the cartel, one at a time, while along the way, increasing the Rebel's ability to fight, making your life a lot easier.


 Final Verdict 
If you have it already, give it a chance, if you don't. Give it a few months for the bug fixes to come in. (We all remember Battlefield 4 launch)

I run the game at a decent 80-90 FPS, My specs are as follows
 
I7 7700 Kaby Lake
ROG Maximus IX
32GB DDR4 Gskill Trident
SLI'd 1070's

I've had no issues loading the game.

												Some parts of the game are rough. The AI teammates are pretty dumb, driving and flying feels mediocre at best, weak unsuppressed gun sounds, and random gameplay glitches to name a few issues. Despite the rough parts, I still really enjoy the gameplay and the challenge when you turn up the difficulty and turn off markers. 

I think the main factor in how much you'll enjoy the game is whether or not you have a friend or group to play it with. If you plan on playing the whole game solo, I think you might find yourself getting bored. Otherwise, with a group of friends, this game is a lot of fun. I stayed up until 3 AM playing the beta with friends. 

If you're on the fence about this game, check if you have any friends that want to play co-op. If you really don't want to pay $60, you can get the non-Steam version for less on other sites or wait for a sale. If you can get it on sale for about $40, I would definitely recommend it.

Important note: You DON'T have to buy any of the microtransaction stuff. It's pretty much just cosmetics and speeding up unlocking things. You're not missing out on anything essential."

												If you like games where you sneak in and kill everyone slow and quiet like Tenchu, or conversely crazy random action like GTAV, Co-op games, 3rd person shooters like the Division, etc... you'll very likely love this.  As I do.

Superb graphics, and detail.
Huge open world, and I mean absolutely HUGE.
Cool weapon customizations... practically gun porn.
Driving and flying with a controller is great, not so much on KB&Mouse.
LOTS to do and collect.
Non-Linear missions, it's got that ""Start the game and go where you want"" feel that Skyrim has!
Runs at 70fps on my rig (gtx1070)
Anyway, can't say enough good things about this.  I'm having a blast... 
Speaking of which, gonna go play more right now!  
One of the few AAA games out that are worth the ridiculous standard asking price of $79.99"

												Honestly this game is fun the first 15 hours after that you feel that all missions are just the same. The thing though lately with ubisoft is that all there games feel like copy pasta with a different skin.

Just can't push myself to finish this game just like Far cry Primal.

The story line lately of ubisoft feels like it's made by a suicidal 14 year old teen. No emotion, no logic, just chaos and repetitive missions.

Thanks ubisoft but i won't buy anymore of your games."

												I played this gam through every stage of testing that I was invited to and was publically avaliable. This game si the reason I got a new graphics card for my computer. Here are a list of reason I like this game and would recommend this game:

1)Far Cry-esque way you can complete missions and take down camps and bases. (sneaking around, gathering intel/scouting, sniping, etc.)
2)Graphics: Seriosuly, I have caught myself looking around at points and marveling at how the game looks. The weather system is awesome
3)Gameplay: Enemies are not bullet sponges like they are/were in the Division. You can kill someone w/ 1 headshot ro two body shots, no more dumping a magazine or two dozen into a boss or enemy to kill them or take out there armor. (Exception being vehicles, but certain skills can counter that.) There are also enemy enviromental facors to consider, such as jamers for the drone, SAM systems, and alarms.
4)Skills/Gear: You can build and make your skills to suit your needs or play style. The only gear farming you do in this is huntign aroudn for the intel caches that can give you the locatiosn for the weaposn and such for each province. No more hoping/hunting for that last gear piece ala the Division."

												finally, a game where the singleplayer isn't a 2 hour afterthought tacked onto a generic arena based shooter.  the map is huge, the enemies numerous, the gadgets allow you to plan attacks in advance and the vehicles are superb at running people over(really satisfying).  although there is dlc and microtransactions they are nowhere near as prevailant as a lot of modern titles have been and the don't overbalance the game... they just speed it up a bit, which is what microtransactions should be in my opinion.  where as a lot of titles have been buggy at launch(anyone up for playing some watchdogs... AC:unity... arkham knight.) i have experienced no problems with this game and considering some of the stunning visuals in this game that is amazing.   i've waited years for another ghost recon and i'm so glad to see it wasn't a waste of time and money unlike a few other modern games i've purchased this is definately not going to warrant a refund request."

												Performance wise -
only one problem so far, you can't play it maxed out even on a card like GTX 1080, i am using GTX 1070 amp extreme, tweaked the settings from very high to ultra, getting decent fps from 60s to 70s and sometimes in 50s while driving. still 8 on 10  game looks damn beautiful and performing good with little tweaking  
Gampley wise - 
One word, AMAZING, well many don't like it but i am telling about my experience, just enjoying every single second of this game, stealth is good, map is brilliant, really beautiful, mission structure is really nice according to me, you are free to do whatever you want and do missions however you want, some people say its strictly stealth but that's not the case, you can play it loud as well. 9.5 out of 10 for gameplay 
Overall - 
just a beautiful game with breath taking scenes and some awesome action, open world fans and stealth fans just go for it. overall score from me is 9.8 on 10 (would have been full 10 on 10 if game was not problematic on maxed out) but still its a diamond !
EDIT- Performance issues gone with all those patches, at least for me."

												I wish this game had a neutral rating. It's not bad, but it's not all that great either. It feels like something is missing and it doesn't really draw me in to keep playing for more than an hour or two at a time. The places you attack all kind of start to feel the same after a while. I start playing for a bit and then kind of just get bored and go play something else. It feels like your not really getting anything done in game and the main quest doesn't do anything to make it feel important. 

I have spent most of my time playing just kind of running around attacking various places and doing a main mission once in a while. The gameplay itself is actually pretty fun and the game looks fantastic, but when you don't feel like your accomplishing anything it's really hard to play for long periods of time at once. The game also has a few stutters while playing, it's not too bad, but it's a bit annoying.

There are lots of weapons, mods and various gear / items you can equip. You can drive, boat, fly choppers / planes, skydive and parachute while jumping off a cliff. The world is pretty large and there are tons of things to do. There is a pretty good upgrade system that lets you focus on specific things like making your character stronger, upgrading the drone, upgrading your AI teammates and upgrading the rebels support. You can free locked up rebel fighters who will just randomly start attacking the enemy which is pretty neat and can help cause some distractions. 

I would purchase this if you are either a fan of the series or if you really like third person open world action / stealth games. It kind of reminds me a bit of Metal Gear Solid V mixed with GTA V plus your own squad with sync shot added. I would give it about a 7.5/10"

												This game is basically the child of Arma and Division with excellent graphics and open world.
Graphically its very much stable on my GTX 1050ti with very high settings.
Apart from customizing your character ,you can customize your guns to your heart content.
The best part is ,you can explore and collect new guns,new gun-parts,intel files etc giving you a purpose to explore a lot in this game.
Also the backstories are excellent,giving you the purpose to eliminate all the 'BAD' guys.

My second fav Ubisoft game in recent years after Watch Dogs 2

Grab it !!! ;)"

												This game is absolutely wonderful.

This is exactly what I wanted out of Division.
I was really disappointed with how the Division turned out and the direction they chose to take it.
Wildlands was definitely not a disappointment.
The Coop is amazing, the weapons are diverse and highly customizable. Character customization is engrossing, the graphics are destryoing my graphics card, the story and game setup are fresh and exciting; you play it as you want and free roam/play the game at your own pace.

GR Future Soldier was not a let down, but Wildlands certainly revived the Ghost Recon we all know and love.
With the direction of titles like Siege and Wildlands, there is an incredibly bright future for the Tom Clancy Franchise."

												The game doesn't feel like it got the name ""Ghost Recon"" stamped on it for the sake of name recognition like they did with Siege. That makes me really happy. It plays like a sequel to all your favorite Ghost Recon games. A little from the original Ghost Recon, Ghost Recon2, Future Soldier and Advanced Warfighter all in an open world environment. The game comes packed with all the customizations a pc gamer wants. If you don't like something, see if you can't change it. Even things like enemy markers can be turned off. The gameplay gets as tactical as you want it to be. I really enjoy this game. Thanks so much devs!"

												Overall the game is fine. Could it be better, of course it could be. The AI are kind of dumb, the driving is blockey but the game for me ran fine with 60-70 fps with FX8350 and SLI GTX 1070. I have yet to play co-op but in the single player experience I found it to be fun but sometimes repetitive and that is with only 3 hours currently logged, hopefully I will find new experiences as I continue to play. In a way this game reminds me of Mercenaries 2 and that is not entirely a bad thing. Do I recommend buying it at 60 bucks.... no wait till a sale for like 40 bucks and till some updates are released as I have read of quite a few FPS issues along with CPU hogging."

Lots of bugs and glitches but thats expected for a game of this size still in the first week of its release (although it would be nice if they can be fixed asap because some bugs are game breaking) luckily the game autosaves pretty well so you don't lose progress. Game is also a little repetative but it's fun so doesn't really bother me. Anyway, the game has a huge map with different terrains, lots of missions and side missions, graphics are amazing, and co-op can be fun if you're playing with friends. Vehicle controls are a little weird but easy to get used to. This game really reminds me of the Just Cause series, so if you're into that game you will defiantly like this one. Overall it's a great game with lots of hours of gameplay (about 16 hours in so far and Im probably at about 5% progress) and will keep you playing for hours on end. Highly recommend"

												Some parts of the game are rough. The AI teammates are pretty dumb, driving and flying feels mediocre at best, weak unsuppressed gun sounds, and random gameplay glitches to name a few issues. Despite the rough parts, I still really enjoy the gameplay and the challenge when you turn up the difficulty and turn off markers. 

I think the main factor in how much you'll enjoy the game is whether or not you have a friend or group to play it with. If you plan on playing the whole game solo, I think you might find yourself getting bored. Otherwise, with a group of friends, this game is a lot of fun. I stayed up until 3 AM playing the beta with friends. 

If you're on the fence about this game, check if you have any friends that want to play co-op. If you really don't want to pay $60, you can get the non-Steam version for less on other sites or wait for a sale. If you can get it on sale for about $40, I would definitely recommend it.

Important note: You DON'T have to buy any of the microtransaction stuff. It's pretty much just cosmetics and speeding up unlocking things. You're not missing out on anything essential."

												Stop complaning people! for the price!  (yes its a bit high atm.. but worth) 

You get Tons of fun if you want it.. 
me and my friends played this constantly for 2 days now and had nothing but FUN! (1 crash, could be pc related and not game)

no bugs (guess we are lucky)

The scenery and the feeling of this game gives me and my friends endless hours of fun.. sure when we get trough the campain we will never play it again.. but if a game can get us all locked at our pc's with fun for 3-7 days.. TOTALLY WORTH!.. 

Sure its alot of things that could be better.. but hey! i got my money worth!

												I'll keep my review short - my impression so far is that Ubi finally produced a decent game, would definitly recommend. Balanced between tactical and arcade-ish gun play, wonky physics that sometimes remind of GTA, interesting story and progression game play so far. I think the gameplay will get repetetive kinda soon, but there is ton of content to explore and collect, or to drop in with friends. If you expect a hardcore tactical shooter, this game is not for you. If you want to enjoy a classic arcade-ish single player shooter, definitly go for this game."

												Before launch I had some mixed feeling about the game considering all the problems I had read about from other reviewers. Fortunately, the game is pretty great. Granted there are some issues I have with the game like the driving mechanics being a little too arcade style and some glitches, but overall I really enjoy the game. I will say to take full advantage of the beautiful graphics you will need a powerful computer."

									Product received for free

												Ran around Bolivia shooting dogs and yelling at people to get on the ground and announcing myself to civilians minding their own business. Also breached the wrong house a few times and shot the dog. Later we surrounded this compound for a couple of days, It was a fun camp out and then we accidentally shot the dog and might have burnt the building down, Also ran into it with a tank. Sorry about that tank thing, hes new. We later went on to hand out guns to the local cartel members so we could track them but we forgot how to track them so we decided to pull out and pretend nothing happened. 10/10 would shoot dog again"

												I Can't belive that i'm finally playing an excellent Open World,  tactical stealth game.
I'm very impressed cuz i thought i will never see any good tactical stealth games after MGS5(the true stealth games LEGEND's)  but i was wrong, Wildlands here

I recommend this super great game for who really like stealth tactical  games , and also for who like to play co-op it has best co-op too.

Important Note:
Just play it in the hardest level for best stealth experience

i'm really would like to give it 10/10 but the story not that much

9/10"

												As much of ubisoft hater as i am, i have to say the game is a big step forward. It still needs 1-2 more patches for optimisation, but it's really fun in multiplayer, if you are lucky enough to find a decent group(which isn't rare).

My biggest issue with the game right now is armored bushes. It really annoys the hell out of me, when i can see enemy behind the bush, but bullets just won't go through it. Really want bullet penetration mechanics introduced to this game."

												Played the beta, and now on the release date the final version. It is an awesome game with lots of content, amazing graphics and somewhat interesting story. But, I have some thoughts about playing it as a tactical shooter, which is my favorite play-style.

I am playing it on the hardest difficulty level, but it is still way too easy. The main reason is your gadgets and teammates are extremely overpowered even from the very beginning. I can use the same tacticts over and over, which is, deploy drone, tag all enemies, mark them for sync shot and let the AI-controlled team members kill them off three at a time.

There are three main problems making this strategy too easy. One is, you have an infinite number of drones. Sure, the range and battery time is somewhat limited, but once it has used its battery you can just spawn a new one in your hand after a short cooldown time. This combined with your AI-controlled teammates ability to sync shoot the enemy flawlessly no matter if they have a clear shot or not, even through a solid mountain, makes you feel you are playing with some kind of cheat code. 

Another issue is the bodies of fallen enemies disappear after a short time, so you can just drop them all over the place with your drone initialized sync shots, and when a patrol comes there they will know nothing. In the end, you just need some patience and you're done.

So, if the enemy is within the range of your drone, they are basically all dead and you can kill them all safely far away behind cover. Your AI teammates will do all the work from impossible angles or distances.

I hope Ubisoft will adress this imbalance. For example by forcing you to pick up your drone if it runs out of battery or at least limit the number of drones you can deploy, have the bodies of enemies stick around until you cleared the area completely and make sure your AI-teammates cannot make impossible shots.

I also found cars are extremely overpowered in the game. You can basically use them as tanks, and just drive around in an enemy territory and have your team kill everyone while you are protected from enemy fire. Since vehicles can drive anywhere due to some car physics engine more geared to ensuring players can never get stuck than realism, there is no limits to how you can deploy this tactics. No need for a road, even GTA feels more realistic after a while. Helicopters also handle in a weird way, in many ways the game smells a bit like rushed.

In general, Ubisoft takes a lot of shortcuts to solve obvious problems. Letting the AI-team sync-shoot through mountains is probably easier to handle for the developers, and also if you leave teammates behind they suddenly just pop back right next to you. Cars handle in a weird way, to make sure you can never get stuck in the landscape, and the list goes on. Many details like these add up until you feel the realism just fades away. So, do not expect a military simulation in any way, even though the game has some serious look to it. 

In the end I will give the thumbs up though, as it is a fun game after all. And, you can still challenge yourself by not using the drone for example. The graphics is also a huge plus. The vast landscape is a joy for the eye, and it is so nice to just roam around to take it all in. Some nice touches like your AI-teammates telling jokes, and the radio programs add a lot to the charm. Hope to see some adjustments to the game after the release though.

EDIT: As someone pointed out in the review comments, you can disable the HUD for a more tactical game experience. This really transformed the game completely, and it is now exactly what I am looking for. With the highest difficulty setting and without the unrealistic hand-holding HUD showing you where all enemies are at any time, it is one of the most spectacular tactical games on the market today! Highly recommended!"

												This is a console to PC port.   Was very optimistic about this game but after playing it for a couple days I sort of regret getting it.  It's like an Assassin's Creed/Far Cry rehash of the same exact game, just with paramilitary aspects.  Marketed to play as solo but the AI is so worthless.  My biggest complaints is the controls, and this is where you really tell its a console port.  It's all clunky, it's like they don't realize its a pc.  Heavily disappointed,"

												This game is Okay. I put 20 hours in day 1 and within 4 days had 48 hours played. I had lots of micro stuttering but no major bugs were experienced personally. Unidad is kinda gay with infinite waves attacking unless you escape, however escaping is easy unless you have to defend an area. 

The missions are all relatively the same Defend, Hack, Tail, Kill or blow up. You can usually run and gun or stealth depending on preferences. In order to do a full campaign restart you have to create a new character which is kinda irritating, however you can restart missions one at a time it doesnt give the same feel. It took me 21 hours to kinda speed run. I didnt really explore outside of getting the guns I want and I did a lot of fast traveling. The game itself will last a long time if you make it. Take your time and set it to extreme with no hud. Easily could take 100 hours to beat. 

The story is good and the co-op is fun, however after beating it it becomes kinda meh. Like you have done it all before. Hope this helps people on the fence about buying the game."

												Aside from the weird car and heli mechanic it's a really great game, the car mechanic isn't that bad if you have a controller. Also the heli mechanic isn't that bad either once you know how it works and it's coming from a guy with nearly 1000 hours on Arma 3. Though there are so bugs happening to me right now such as freezing 3-5 sec while driving/flying (freezes passengers too) and the low fps i get when there are a lot of Ai around. I get 60-85 fps on low settings, open beta didn't lag me at all, was always on 65 fps on high settings. Hope there will be fixes coming soon, overall amazing gameplay and there's still so much to do and progress.

												Here's the deal, short and sweet. There are plenty of things that could have been done better, but I am enjoying the gameplay so far, because the things that I have to complain about are not enough to stop me from enjoying it.

Cons: (AKA stuff that really should not be an issue in 2017)
After you swap your gun for a gun on the ground, you cannot pick your 1st gun up, it just disappears and you have to find a weapons locker to re-equip it if you don't like the new one.

Absolutely god awful 3rd/1st person switching to aim down the sights.

No ""shoulder swap"" button for the camera. I've been ""stuck"" in left handed over the shoulder cam mode ever since I went into cover in a corner, and the only way to change it back is to try to manipulate it back to the right shoulder through the cover mode system.

Terrible vehicle controls. I mean, it's a Ubisoft title, so this is no surprise. When has ANY Ubi game EVER had good driving? Never. But this is pretty bad, even for Ubi. I espected FarCry levels of crappy handling, but this makes Farcry's vehicle handling look like  a racing sim.

Loading times. Now obviously these will vary from rig to rig, but man this is the slowest loading game I own. I can have Witcher III up and running on max and be in-game in about 30 seconds, including splash screens  and stuff, but it took 15-20 seconds for my characters CLOTHES to change in the creation menu. I don't know why, there was virtually no buffer time in between changing options in the beta. Who knows, maybe itll get better with a patch.

Movement feels kind of slow and clunky. I get the realism aspect of it and am really attracted to the less ""run and gun"" aspect, but it kind of feels like you are slogging through molasses. If movement actions are going to be so slow, at least give me like a dive-into-prone option or something. MGS: Phantom Pain brings to mind a really well done movement system. I mean, for pete's sake, you can't even sprint while crouched. I know that you can't really ""sprint"" when you are hunched over, but most games have a ""scoot-boogey-shuffle faster"" sprint for when you're crouched.

And the voice acting/script in general is as bad as all the other reviews say. It's not like they are super bad at delivering their lines, the dialog itsself just seems flat. The voice actors do an ok job considering they are only reading what is in front of them.

All in all, I liked the bit I've seen. Most of the things I have to gripe about is just ""videogame stuff"", that you are going to find pretty much anywhere in games, by and large. I think there are a lot of people who have it out for Ubi, and will never be pleased with anything they release because they have a chip on their shoulder (and with some of their business practices like their pricing structures and DLC sales, I do not blame them), but I try not to boycott entire companies, and evaluate on a more game-by game basis. 

Bottom line, I would wait until this is 50% off or so, because there are other good titles with very similar gameplay for cheaper. I justified speding 60 bucks on this because I needed something new and it was worth not waiting for a sale to come along. I'd say ignore the negative reviews and at least give it a try. Worst case scenario is you refund it."

												Realy fun! :D 20+ hours in Open Beta
Do NOT play this alone, find someone with similar playstyle and taste as you and you will have an amazing time.

AI: 7/10 they pretty much have aimbot but they act very human while passive
Gameplay: 8.5/10 starts to feel MGS:FP'ish after a while but not quite
Graphics: 9/10
Driving: 9/10 in open beta, after spoiled kids cried, Devs tried to fix it and failed so i'd say 5/10 now

The game is a Blast, i suggest playing with one person though as 3 or 4 might become chaotic. Feels Perfectly made for 2 people."

												Great game that did not disappoint me. I have fun playing it solo and of course coop. Whereby coop is the best way to play it.

It has a huge map with hundreds of tasks and missions. Fully customizable caracter, guns and a lot of perks and even more guns.

The map is vast with different natural environement. Most of the houses can be entered. 

AI is okay, enemies are no bullet sponge. One shot. One kill. Stealth is key in later missions.

I like that you can change from 3rd to first person when you aim. Good controls with mouse.

Cars, helicopters, boats, tanks, planes a lot to play with with good controls if you know how. Even with mouse and keyboard this works fine for me. If you have problems with it, just exercice a bit more.

BUT, still some bugs. Even if the performance is good on my rig (check my specs in my profile if you are interested), the game itself has some graphic bugs, has control bugs, etc. But I am sure that this will be fixed as this has always been the case with Ubisoft and its AAA games. Sometimes you can not overcome an obstacle, you press space, but nothing changes...

I recommend the game even for full price. I am sure it will receive plenty of more free updates and modes coming in the future. It is a game that Ubisoft will support quite a while since the fanbase is already there and only growing.

Haters gonna hate... as always, downvote my review. I don't care.

Open world well made. Sand-box as it should be. Great visuals! No reason not to join this fun."

												Lots of fun solo, haven't really tried with people yet. Just amazing to look at and Ansel images are insane in detail. The game plays well, and although repetative, there's enough diversity in the locations and your approaches that I don't seem to get tired of it. Frame rate also needs improvement. Only getting about 45-60FPS on ultra with GTX1080/i7-7700k at 1440p. Had better frame rate on beta and also controller support... there's something odd going on right now with that.

The AI sucks a bit still and is pretty dumb sometimes, which I hope UBI works on and the driving although fun, has little to no concesquences when you when you decide to defy physics. You can pretty much drive up or down anything, off cliffs, etc and there's no real damage. That would be nice to improve as well.

The one thing completely lacking......in ""Wildlands"" is .... well.... wildlife.... There's a few birds here or there, a couple other mammals in select areas, but you can run km's through mountains, forests, etc and not run into a single animal. Immersion ruined ;)

Good:

-Fun gameplay
-Lots of weapons and accessories
-Drop dead gorgeous graphics
-Very large environment

Bad:

-AI is slow (even your own AI squad)
-Environment can feel empty at times
-Physics are laughable
-Frame rates need working on"

Let me tell you, I am impressed. Ubisoft raises from it's ashes with a great game.

PROS:
- AMAZING Graphics, downgrade from E3 is barely noticable.
- Gameplay transition between Singleplayer/coop is seemless and well made.
- Character customization is good, not the best but good enough for this type of game.
- Map is huge and very fun to discover.
- Playing with friends is very fun.
- Arcade-ish combat system which I very like, not too realistic not too unrealistic: just perfect.

CONS:
- Optimization is... lacking. But is not the worst. My 1080 was able to handle Ultra rounding near 60 fps at all times.
- Gameplay tad repetitive in singleplayer.

I recommend this game to anyone!"

												First off i must say congratulations Ubisoft for Releasing such an amazing port to PC. A Well spent £40....Please keep releasing stable ports!. After watch dogs 2 i nearly gave up with Ubisoft titles. Ubisoft has amazed me with this release!!!!!. Keep up the hard work. 

Anyway the game has awesome graphics the frame rate on Very high settings hovers around 80-90FPS at 2560x1080p. Incredibly stable and more than playable. Its amazed me how well the game runs even on AMD Graphics Cards. I am currently running an R9 Fury X and the game runs smooth as butter. The Nvidia gamework Features dont effect my gameplay but i see no need for it. The Game has a Vysnc issue and wont run stable 60fps...Pretty Sure it will be fixed. Apart from these 2 little things....The game is awesome and needs to be bought and put into your Steam library. And keep it in your Library for good!. Please Ubisoft keep releasing good ports. I have been a long time fan of your work...But for the past 4 years or so you declined however........THIS GAME IS A SOLID 10/10!. WELL DONE UBISOFT. You deserve a F""""king medal. Is this the start of the upclimb of Ubisoft? I hope so. :)

Buy it...You will be impressed. Contender for game of the year and its only march!. If you dont buy this game....You absolutely suck. And not to mention im Happy Ubisoft has finally released a game which is amazing on AMD cards.I have been super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when a game is dedicated to Nvidia and performance on AMD declines!. 




BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!"

-The game is somehow really pretty and yet some of the textures are straight out of NBA Live 2000 (they suck).
-When you switch reticle types in the red dot that shows the reticle selection knob ON the physical item, the nob doesn't switch position when the reticle does. I know this is small, but a game about details that features so many small items from the real gun world, this is important.
-Shallow non-cutscene dialogue. The PCC and NPC dialogue is like 2 total lines that are repeated over and over. Get ready for a ""shitballs"" every 9 seconds.

PROS:
-Bullet drop.
-Sexy sound effects.
-Lots of guns and customization.
-You aren't forced into spending money on in-game items.
-It's hella mad fun to play this with your pals."

												This game is awesome!

To be honest i find this game very fun playing with friends 
The tactical feel is awesome and fun. Playing solo is cancer because the bots sucks and is just in the way. Would had been awesome if there was a option to remove the bots

The optimizaion is a big improvment since the open beta

Positive:
-Fun playing with friends
-Nice combat mechanics
-The bullet drop is good
-The missions are fun but some time repeitive
-Taging stuff for XP
-Currently playing the story

Negative:
-Sometime i end up in host migration screen and it disconnect me everytime
-Driving and flying controls are a bit derpy
-All other players should get the taged stuff too if one player founds it
-Parachute mechaincs are weird too
-The vehicle physics are horrible
-Screen freeze sometime for the joining player (fixed for i5 users)

(Things i wrote are in my opinion and what i have experience through out the game)"

												I enjoyed the open beta and pre-ordered this game. Its finally come out and im really enjoying it. As for performance im playing on high settings getting around 45 to 60 fps on a rx 470 4gb with an i7 920 oc to 3.2ghz.The game feels smooth and have had no crashes or issues since playing it so far. looking forward to playing more. Its also really fun either solo or with friends. theres plenty to do. A lot of people say it gets repetitive but i have not felt that way, yea the missions are going from point A to point B or take over this, interogate that. But all in all its still so much fun."

												This game is really amazing. It lets you customize your character in many different ways, right when you spawn in it gets you into the action.

-Something I dont like is the driving it feels like your stuck to the ground.
 
But in all other words the game is great, you should definitley check this game out"

												This is my first Ghost Recon game so I might have a more sentimental than critical view on the game generally. I got really frustrated at first especially due to the stuttering problem I was having with the game which definitely had nothing to do with my PC specs. I felt like if I had written the review before I got it fixed, it would probably have been a thumbs down because the game is really promising. I like the whole idea behind the plot and the game setting even though its not exactly accurate. Not veryexpansive with character customization but the variety in outfits makes up for it, sort of. It also comes with a good number of guns that we probably know and love from the division and battlefield franchises, most of which have to be retrieved or bought. I dont see it having a high replay value though once the boss has been taken care of. Sure, there are rebel missions and skill missions that can be undertaken after but it is rendered moot once the goal of the game has been accomplished unless you want to completely take over with maxed out rebel support and player skills. All in all, I think its a very good game that will be fun playing both with friends and solo as the AI are fully engaged and tactical as well (sometimes I prefer using them to actual players), I'm excited for what the game has in store for the near future and I really hope it gets new content!"

												 Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon® Wildlands Review
 First impressions 
This game ran very smooth for me. The game have been optimzed very good since the open beta. My frame-rate never dropped below 75+ fps at near max settings. No crashes or stuttering. The game seems to be getting some pretty bad reviews for so many bad reasons, the usual graphics, 'the physics, open world and driving arent like GTA etc... I think people should take time to appreciate the elements and concepts going on and you will realise it is a good and fun game. People nowdays just dont appreciate games like this anymore sadly. People will also just hate the game just cause' it is ubisoft. If its open world it has to be like gta. If its a shooter it has to be some online mulitplayer shootem run and gun. this is an old school gamers game. Alot of people were also saying this game is just a divsion reskin. In my opinion this is nothing like the division and are different games.  Its similarity is that it's a third person fps to first person aim. The game in my opinon follows more closely to the Farcry series, if you loved farcry you will love this game no doubt. The game it self is epic. Huge map, very interactive and alive. Squad base physics where you
can sneek and wipe out an enemy outpost or go in all guns blazing. It's your choice.
There is a skill tree to unlock the perks you want. 

 Stealth 
Stealth is definitely the way to go and it looks like this it what the game mainly wants you to do, but you can still have a lot of fun rambo the enemy on the streets, going full MLG 420 style.

 Positives & Negatives 
Positives:

•Plenty of side missions so there is plenty of things to do.
•Each mission is your option. I.e loud and rambo mode or sneaky ninja
•Co-op is fun.
•Dynamic World
•The single player experience is pretty fun and nice to chill out to.
•The map has little heat spots which show the density of enemies in the area.
•Pieces of intelligence can be gathered in order to activate side missions and upgrade your character.
•I had a great deal of fun with it, that and I have not played the other Ghost Recon game.
•Very nice character customisation.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=878642296
•The online connectivity is pretty stable
•Amazing graphics like all Ubisoft games
•Co-op everything with up to 4 friends
•Tactical game play
•Beautiful even on low graphics 
•100s of hours of gameplay ( If you do EVERYTHING)

Negatives:

• No ""Jump"" button, instead you are forced to only jump when its available.
•Physics are a bit crazy sometimes (was complete mental during the open beta)
•The controls for the vehicles on both keyboard and controller are wierd af.
•Not that well optimised for machines which are at or above the minimum requirements.
•Car controls are hard to get used to and can randomly change directions at will.
•If the server disconnects and the co-op partner is the driver of a vehicle you are in, the controls seem to lock and the vehicle sporadically moves sometimes.
•Poor car physics ,it's like driving a car in csgo in early beta mod stages , feels very clunky
•Helicopter has a weird self leveling style which make it very hard to control,  not a great experience http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=878633397
•Third person view could be set a little further away from character in my opinion (yes, i know about extended fov.) 
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=878634874

 Disappointed I was hoping for ubisoft for once to not take this direction, but alot of game does this nowdays, but i still don't support this. What i'm i talking about? -> ""In-game currency""..
You have to pay for a Flag badge for example, its not unlocked in the base-game.
You can buy all scopes. All attachments. Basically Everything. This is so sad to see, as it makes grinding more pointless. They clearly milking you for that cash.

 How this game feels like  
Wildlands is:

...like Just Cause series, except instead of getting around by having actual fun with the in-game physics, your main way of travel will be by teleporting with fast travel like a wizard from harry potter.

...like GTA V, except the cities , smooth and working vehicle controls, good customization and player population.

...like Borderlands, except the variety of equipment and weapons.

...like Battlefield, except the map and world design is generic and there aren't almost even any hints of destructible enviroments on the world map.

...like Splinter Cell, except the AI is like spinbotters from CS:GO non-prime on anything above normal difficulty.

...like Sleeping Dogs, except instead of having an intriguing and borderline alternative story where you choose your actions and pick a side with consequences, you're instead force-fed the most generic plotline ever.

...like Watch Dogs, except instead of having ""smoothly"" transitioning between players in singleplayer and multiplayer, you are instead thrown back and forth in the form of neutral and boring af loading screens.

...like Titanfall, except the high-end PvE and PvP content available.

  Do you recommend this game? Yes, definitely. The game have it's flaws but well worth the buy. Its a good and fun game.

 Review update (WARNING! SPOILERS!) 
Negative:
-Enemies disappear after 500m (if not scoped on)
-Bullets sems to travel much slower than in reality
-Story doesn't make much sense after last mission is completed, (when bowman takes down sueno), the rebels is still on your side(they wont shoot you) and if you still have some missions left the people you have taken down will talk from the dead.

- If you focus on only the main story missions your looking at 35hrs of gameplay tops.
- There is nothing to do after the main story is completed (well you can try and collect all medals, legends and side-missions but those are boring af) 
- Very little variation in jets and helicopters (only 2 jets in the game wtf)
- The enemies look ALL the SAME (exept the bosses)
- No ""end-game"" like in The Division

												This game is great. Some troubles here and there but great to play as a casual gamer. The solo mode works very well for me. I did not receive any major crashes yet (two occurred within 23h of gameplay).
What I really need to get used to is the control of the planes and helicopters. At the moment, this is a pain for me.
Overall, I really recommend this game and look forward to further improvements / patches. E.g. also new mission types ;)

One big issue is the fact of missing features with the ATI graphics card. Screenshots are nice, but creating a high-resolution panorama view (with set graphic settings or even better) would be a great benefit because the created landscapes is really perfect. I read that this works on Nvidia graphics cards but to be honest this is not worth it to buy a new graphic card. So please include this for ATI as well!

Looks like I still have some hours to play until I'm through ;)"

												Ok played Both Closed and Open beta.(My thought's on that where)
car's suck,Flying suck's,laggy,freezing all the time.
I was worryed because i Pre Ordered it!!!!
And after what the Divsion did to me was a little more worryed!!!!

The release came loaded it up.
Mind Blow ran smoother than a baby's bottom ( had issuse's while freakn Auto save) freeze.
But apart from that.

Never have i had so much fun in this game there's
-Laughing
-Crying
-Running from Unidad Happens alot lol
-reviving
-Glitches the fun one's

But on a real note.
There a ♥♥♥♥en alot to do i ♥♥♥♥ you knot!!!!
i'm running max everythink have odd issuse's at start nothing to write home about or Write on steam forum's about been a blast just finshed a 8 hour session no crashes nothing so it's fine.
The world itself is WOW just WOW the detail in this (Clapping)

the mission's them self's well havn't played it by myself yet are and should be for 4 player's or 3 or a solo Rambo
if unidad are around get ready for Fun lol ( Noramlly me getting us into the ♥♥♥♥)
Back to mission's some are super hard or you have to be SUPER I MEAN SUPER STEALTH!!! like dont even fart or fail mission lol.
and when ever you exract some one the plan never come's out like those E3 Vid's ""Hell Break's loose""
this for me where the fun come's in the 3 people i've been playing with we all have our skill's and tactic's

Sound.
Well get used to hearing HOLA!!! alot lol and random women screaming ( we call this ♥♥♥♥ scream's lol)

Gun's sound amazing as they should
Car's some have turbo's,some don't but you know when your in a V8
whole world amazing.
The radio station What the ♥♥♥♥ where you thinking about i'd do a much better job than that ♥♥♥♥.(only flaw)
just give a option to add our own Custom tracks at least.

The main Bad dude in this Remind's me of Kingpin from Daredevil on netflick's.

Overall this game blew me out of the water and still does just an amazing location.
very well set out.

these guy's did a awsome job 50 somethink hours havent even really started lol.

10/10

												What is with all the hate? The Division is a great game...

            In all seriousness this game isn't a clone of The Division, and is also very fun. However, I can see where some complaints come as this game seems to be rushed. So yes it is a great game but unless you aren't a fan of this genre I would either wait for the game to become more complete and/or wait for a price drop.

If you liked The Division, this game should already be in your library because its similar .

												Ya know I wasn't expecting such a good game and I'm not going to really make any bad claims because the game is Amazing! I mean you need the new Nvidia Drivers to run it stably but I mean it's worth getting the new drivers anyway.

So the run down I'll give pros and cons about this game and you can decide wither you want to get it or not.

Pros
It's a pretty big map and this game isn't something you spend 4 hours on like Watch Dogs 2 and For Honor but I guess I can't compare those games so forget I said anything.
So many different things you can do, though some times you find your self stuck because there isn't really anything to do but well do quests and side missions that give you the Resources to unlock new skills.
Tons of different weapons to use, and then you get parts you can customize it's just never ending to be fair.
The Character Customization isn't too bad, there's lots of different cloths you can use.
Probably what sold me was being able to become bushman.

So now it's time to go hard on this game I only listed a few of the ""Worthy"" Pros that really I thought could make it in and get someones attention really.

Cons
Ghillie suits don't work as a better stealth option sadly, Ubisoft fix this plz.
Skills require ""Resources"" which makes it kinda fun to get skills in the beginning but then it gets either annonying or you stack up just tons of ones you don't need and can't find the ones you need.
Guns are a little weird from how you would think they would work, but bullet drop is prefect TBH, if you want to know what I mean by ""weird"" I mean it feels like your playing airsoft in a game just the Airsoft guns make gun shot sounds.
Vehichle controllers are diffenetly not up to par with other games like it though you get used to it, ignore this if you use a controller it's better with one.
Takes a really long time to find where every Keybind is but I guess this is just me :P
Voice chat and Text chat are broken you're better off using a Voice communitcation program like discord.

That concludes my list guys! Hope this helps you decide if you want the game or not!"

Ghost reacon Wildlands is a beautiful tactical shooter at it's core but lacks some serious features of a AAA standard game.
After craeting a character (Which is lame by the way, its just some random cosmetics except the cool ones locked behind paywall ). Then i joined one of my buddy in co op and played for straight 3 to 4 hours, it was fun but ..... but that's it that is the whole backbone of the game.
For me it's.
                  Graphics : HUGE map with stunning visuals, character and gun models are top notch, day night cycle with weather fx is awesome.

                   Audio & Sound fx : OKish voice acting with sub-par sound fx but i feel like every weapon has same sound almost , with a silencer its PEW PEW without it phut phut.... It is not acceptable for a tactical shooter.

                   Gameplay : It's fun but very repetative but in a good way, scout the area be stealthy or just gunblaze. The AI though are either very stupid or the game feels easy on the hardest difficulty FTW ubisoft (Yes I'm looking at The Division). Again the vast map is beautiful but feels very empty just like Just cause 3. Objectives are same from the first 3 hour , go there kill him/her , go there capture and extract intel , ton of lame fetch quest , till you face the boss , some lame guy with random tatoos on em. No character devlopment no charisma nothing pure tasteless.

                     Overall : For me it is a wait for sale because if you get it now and you dont have friends to play with then you will get bored in 3 to 4 hours ."

												Downvotes for Ubisoft games are usually very common, mainly because the company itself is pure cancer and treats their customers like ♥♥♥♥. With Ghost Recon Wildlands they offer about everything I hate about modern video gaming: Pre-order DLC, ""Deluxe Edition"" with additional cosmetic items, Season-Pass and Microtransactions that would even be too much in a f2p title. So I'm missing out on tons of stuff by ""just"" spending 60€ (and not preordering).
So if you ask me, Ubisoft deserves all the disrespect there is and even more.

BUT: Would I still recommend Ghost Recon Wildlands? Yes, definitely! All the hate for Ubisoft and their shady business practises can't change that this is a very enjoyable game, set in a beautiful world with an intense atmosphere. The story is interesting so far and the storytelling through a lot of different types of sources makes it even more enjoyable (Videotapes, Phonecalls, Audiotapes, interrogations and other cutscenes etc.).

Just don't buy the crap they offer. Don't get cosmetics, additional weapons, XP Boosts, don't pre-order and let the season pass go ♥♥♥♥ himself! This is the only way things will ever change back to the good, where we receive 100% of the product for 100% of an AAA titles price."

												After, about 40 hours of gameplay.  I have to say. i am not totally hooked. but i did enjoy it. minor some annoyances.

This game had the potential to be, the best game ever made. but then it fell short. 

here are the pros:

Incredibly amazing graphics that  Runs smootly, spanning over a huge map.
The combat and AI are Above what you would consider Average. 
The Story line and acting is somewhat captivating. 
Performance wise, this game is gold. with just a few bugs i encountered. (Called for SUV, landed on my head and killed me). but this only happened once. 

some of the silly things

Game has a little bit of the MAD max sandbox syndrome. A little, not entirely that much. 
See i enjoyed MAdMAx, but having or feeling like you have to do all those side repetetive grind tasks on the side can be dreary. and until now i still havent finished the game. In Ghost i feel like it might end up the same way.
As i said, the story line it self is brilliant. but since the game needs you to do all the side tasks to improve your self. well.

prepare to do 24 times each of the following.
Steal helicopter, steal plane, steal truck, Attack sattelite relay, press E on two Towers 1km apart in 1min time.
Tag a supply drop, and deffend a radio relay, and i think scare soem guy to death by shouting crpa in his ears.....etc? maybe i missed one or two.

See after doing this maybe 7 times now, i really dont wanna do it again, and yet i have to. anyways. I just wish Sandbox games would do less with this repetetive nonesense. I dont mind that i have seen some bases more than once. (copy and paste) I dont mind as there are lots of variety still. and you do feel like you are really in an entire country. I trully enjoyed flying or boating down river. its trully a visual experience on a 34 in screen at least.

in a nutsehll, i really feel like they missed out on an opportunity to make something truly epic. with all the rooms they had to play with. they could have shown GTA V how you can do it better. but then again. GTA spent 300m$.

MUTIPLAYER CO-OP.

Unless its your friends on MIC COMS. just dont bother. 3  AI are more fun, have better things to say. and can be assinged to SYNC shoot. so you can kill 4 ore more in one hit. really. dont bother palying with randoms. just takes longer and it spoils the sequencin of your campign map. 

anyways, i hope you enjoy the game."

												This is a very nice game. The opimization is great and the graphics are amazing. I love the first person aiming, but I really think making you able to change from first to third while running or driving, or just in general add first person could be a nice feature.

If they would continue to update the game, with new weapons, attachments, and clothes, I would definitley spend more on the season pass. But I ain't buying a season pass of the pricetag on 40 euro when they only have 2 expansions and new cars..."

												WILDLANDS

Nice environment
Nice sounds
Nice graphics
Nice gunplay
Nice loadouts and customization

Terrible co-op disconnect problem
Terrible vehicle controls - especially the helicopter
Terrible uni-mmersive civilian AI
Terrible glitches - people appearing outside of vehicle in co-op

This game needs to be updated and shouldn't have been released fully in this state.

Farcry + The Division + GTA + Arcade State of Decay driving...

4 hours of trying to play with a friend, constant disconnects after 5-15min. Spent most of that time simply trying to look online for people having similar issues trying to fix it.

4/10. 

Requested a refund. 
May rebuy when it's patched and playable in co-op for ALL players. 

Refund denied...

Second refund request.

Refund denied...

												- Good mashup between The Division, Far Cry and Just cause.
- FPS mechanics like Far Cry 3 or 4
- 3rd Person mechanics similiar to The divison
- And a litte insanity like Just cause
- Driving is ok, from my POV there is lil room to improve
- Flying the chopper is a lil strange, but you get use to it fast and then it's somooth and easy.

Recommendation:
- Put difficulty to hardest or 2nd hardest stage and remove some of the HUD elements
- Play with friends in COOP"

												I just sunk 50 hours of my life into this game, I still haven't completed it - I still feel like I could play this another 1000 hours and not get bored.

Pros:
Graphics are magnificent, by far the best I've seen.
Customization options are vast.
Co-op & playing with AI give the game two different feels, both satisfying.
Gameplay and personal play style come together in an amazing way,
PvP is supposably happening - 4v4.
Replayability is absolutely endless.

Cons:
Controlling your character can feel clunky at times, both in 3rd person & vehicles - especially helo's.
Skill tree feels a bit lackluster.
Wearing stealthy camoflauge has no impact in game.
Fast travel needs some fixes.
Some missions are bugged & won't allow you to complete them.

Overall, this is the first game in quite some time that gives me an overall satisfaction, one that I cherrish. For me, it mixes a lot of games that I've absolutely loved together into one - I mean don't get me wrong - there's a LOT more I wish I could see this game have, but I'm not holding my breath because Ubisoft hasn't been kind to folks modding their games.

I just wanna throw it out there, it would be absolutely amazing if this game got modded for a Jurrassic Park type game. I would love to fight Unidad and a T-Rex. I'm just saying. Either way, this is a great game and I highly recommend it."

												Chicken's explode when you shoot them.

11/10 would shoot a chickenbomb again.

In all seriousness though, this game is amazing. No performance issues, on my dated i5 3570k, with GTX970 and 16gb Ram, on an SSD with Windows 8.1. The world is beautiful, everything works and I am quite honestly surprised how decent the game is. Will be playing it a lot for the forseeable future. 

If you are even remotely interested in this game (and you meet the PC req's) buy it, it's a no-brainer. Ubisoft has delivered.

EDIT 12/03/17: With the latest update, a minor freezing issue I had is non-existant. It was an i5 problem, and not my internet, that was solved 100%. Game is running even better :)

Don't listen to reviews from people with less than 5 hours or even under 10, there is so much depth to this game that people won't see unless they have played more. For example, at night the guards in a base go to bed/sleep leaving minimal security to defend themselves. It's not perfect, but then show me a game that is. The views are fantastic and exploration on the bike can keep you busy for ages.

As you progress through the skill tree, certain tasks become easier and your team becomes stronger. You have so many options available to you.

I apologise that this isn't the best written review but perhaps I will rewrite it after I have played a bit more as I am still NOWHERE near complete after almost 60 hours."

												Please disreard the 0.2 hours on record. I play offline in my office.
Here's a singleplayer review after logging in 15 hours - 
1. The AI is not perfect, but as you level them up, they definitely get better.
2. The AI perform better when given specific orders. Move to specific location works always. 'Follow me' about half the time.
3. The enemy AI always seems better. So better, in fact, that they are liable to see you first most times. Apparently, they   have a sixth sense specially for you, and detect you behind walls and such. To balance things out, your squad can shoot through walls, trees and even entire mountains in a sync-shot.
4. The squad AI pass along a lot of awkward jokes that nobody laughs at.
5. The squad AI isn't that bad, and most times they do detect enemy, and warn you of new enemies along with specific location (""sniper in the tower!""). Weirdly enough, they can mark enemies through walls. 
6. You needn't wait for your buddies to get in a car. They magically appear once you start driving. 
7. Your buddies are huge bullet-sponges. This helps when you are down and need revival. 
8. Also, they cannot take down choppers.
9. Stealth sequences always work awesomely, which makes me think the AI was made with stealth in mind.
Overall, a fun single-player expierence in a keep-your-brains-aside- when-playing way."

												this is a fun game worth buying even at $50. Ubisoft didn't do too shabby. seems to incorporate a lot of ~tactical operator culture~, name dropping brands like 5.11 Tactical and Crye Precision (and don't forget the tactical beards).

pros: tacticool guns, really scratches that comfy co-op itch, offers a nice experience for both casual and more serious players

cons: extremely vulgar commentary from in game characters, doesn't have any truly interesting game mechanics (but it's a co-op game so whatever), features silly Tom Clancy ghostwriter writing (""narcostate"" lmao)

not a good game, but not a bad game at all. its a fun game. it's like MGSV with much less artistic flair, and with co-op. I don't regret the purchase"

												GTA meets the Division. Single player is ok. It can be done. This game shines in multiplayer. I have not had this much fun running around with friends in a game in years. Some games are just a grind.  Last night I finally looked up and noticed I had over 20 skill points to apply. I was not even concerned about leveling up. It was more about the gameplay. I enjoyed sneaking around. Taking out guards one at a time while communicating with my friends on who had which targets. I had a buddy sit overwatch to guard my back while I made my way through the city. Then I heard a thud. My buddy had sniped a guard next to me that I had not noticed. Fantastic game.

												Here's the deal, short and sweet. There are plenty of things that could have been done better, but I am enjoying the gameplay so far, because the things that I have to complain about are not enough to stop me from enjoying it.

Cons: (AKA stuff that really should not be an issue in 2017)
After you swap your gun for a gun on the ground, you cannot pick your 1st gun up, it just disappears and you have to find a weapons locker to re-equip it if you don't like the new one.

Absolutely god awful 3rd/1st person switching to aim down the sights.

No ""shoulder swap"" button for the camera. I've been ""stuck"" in left handed over the shoulder cam mode ever since I went into cover in a corner, and the only way to change it back is to try to manipulate it back to the right shoulder through the cover mode system.

Terrible vehicle controls. I mean, it's a Ubisoft title, so this is no surprise. When has ANY Ubi game EVER had good driving? Never. But this is pretty bad, even for Ubi. I espected FarCry levels of crappy handling, but this makes Farcry's vehicle handling look like  a racing sim.

Loading times. Now obviously these will vary from rig to rig, but man this is the slowest loading game I own. I can have Witcher III up and running on max and be in-game in about 30 seconds, including splash screens  and stuff, but it took 15-20 seconds for my characters CLOTHES to change in the creation menu. I don't know why, there was virtually no buffer time in between changing options in the beta. Who knows, maybe itll get better with a patch.

Movement feels kind of slow and clunky. I get the realism aspect of it and am really attracted to the less ""run and gun"" aspect, but it kind of feels like you are slogging through molasses. If movement actions are going to be so slow, at least give me like a dive-into-prone option or something. MGS: Phantom Pain brings to mind a really well done movement system. I mean, for pete's sake, you can't even sprint while crouched. I know that you can't really ""sprint"" when you are hunched over, but most games have a ""scoot-boogey-shuffle faster"" sprint for when you're crouched.

And the voice acting/script in general is as bad as all the other reviews say. It's not like they are super bad at delivering their lines, the dialog itsself just seems flat. The voice actors do an ok job considering they are only reading what is in front of them.

All in all, I liked the bit I've seen. Most of the things I have to gripe about is just ""videogame stuff"", that you are going to find pretty much anywhere in games, by and large. I think there are a lot of people who have it out for Ubi, and will never be pleased with anything they release because they have a chip on their shoulder (and with some of their business practices like their pricing structures and DLC sales, I do not blame them), but I try not to boycott entire companies, and evaluate on a more game-by game basis. 

Bottom line, I would wait until this is 50% off or so, because there are other good titles with very similar gameplay for cheaper. I justified speding 60 bucks on this because I needed something new and it was worth not waiting for a sale to come along. I'd say ignore the negative reviews and at least give it a try. Worst case scenario is you refund it."

												Really enjoying this game, It runs really well on my mediocure machine (GTX 960 Ti). The gun play is fun, and the story is actually good if you read and watch all the intel clips you can pick up. Don't mind the weinies saying this game is frustrating, they just haven't figured out how to be tactical and use the game's mechanics to their advantage. I have not had any issures with connectivity either so it may be some folks just don't have their NAT type set properly. The views in this game are pretty breath taking with the fidelity and amount of detail that has been put into the world map.

												In general, the game is fun. Gone are the days of little puny maps and limited game play. 

Pros:
Great gameplay ( I don't consider this Ghost Recon but, ok..)
Great graphics and visuals.
interesting storyline
HUGE map (forget about the last titles created in the 3rd by UBISOFT)
Great ability to make a character that looks real (some cheesy looking characters)
respawning is near your objective (see cons:)
Cons:
I'm level 4 now and the game locked up on me by a helo base and It took me 5 minutes to get my MSI gaming laptop to turn off. just heard my speakers squealing. 
some missions are about impossible to complete. 3 minutes to get into the mine???? puhlease.
bugs are still abound and need to be worked out. See Con #1
typical, money suck machine. buy weapons packs to get better weapons, uniforms and such
This is a money grab to get you to buy packs, weapons, clothing, facepaint(ok..), country patches.
the 3rd person driving view. (on the pro side: the huge map makes the fun expansive and the driving view point not so bad)
no support units (having been in the military, ALL units have support units for support in heated battles.)
4 man play. no real military foundation of gameplay. helicopters are too tough. a 7.62 or full mag of 5.56mm should damage the helo to bring it down or not function properly, I would know.
respawning, I started the silver mine mission at night and then respawn puts me back at mid day roughly. dumb to do missions in braod day light."

												Feels much like a cross between GTA and Far Cry with a military special ops theme. So far I've only had the chance to play single player and its been a ton of fun. The stealth operates quite well and there are plenty of ways to approach each firefight. The game incentivises clean and quick engagements by making large firefights difficult to survive, which considering the circumstances (4 friendlies and many bad guys) is pretty realistic. The skill point system gives a progression to the game that is welcome.

My only complaints so far are team AI and driving. The team AI is good if you command them well. For example the sync shot system works very well and allows you to take out 2+ enemies at the same time. But in open firefights there can be situations where one of your guys is parked in front of an enemy and is getting lit up without returning fire. Team AI can be remedied by coop with friends which I haven't had the chance to partake in yet. The driving is a bit clunky at times but is managable after getting used to it.

This game is definitely worth the price of admission."

												Short Review focusing on Pros and Cons & Future.I will Edit this post depending on future missions

Pros:- Map is Massive, there are empty areas true but they're beautiful
- Lots of missions and side missions
- Graphics are good (downgraded but still good)
- It's fun to play, especially with friends
- Character Customization gives you tons of options
- Drivivng is very good

Cons:- Optimization is not great
- Missions get repetitive, especially for Solo Players
- Difficulty doesn't matter Easy or Hard require same skills
- A.I. is Dumb
- Microtransactions (Damn I love Golden Vehicles bought them)
- Your Personal Vehicles can't be ordered, you have to go and get them
and they'll probably be destroyed until you reach your destination...

Future:- There will be PVP, atleast 4v4 (I hope 8v8 will be a thing)
- I don't know about whole current story but one of the dlc's will include Inside missions so these are alot different than current ones, you'll act as one of their own.
- Seasonal Events, I'm not really sure what kind of Seasonal events these will be, and if they will bring content, but I hope there will be Seasonal Events like (Halloween, Xmas etc)."

												A decent game, but very repetitive. Hopefully they add in more variety to missions and gameplay. I got this game because in the open beta I met awesome people. We had fun and agreed we'd all get it. I highly recommend doing coop and multiplayer, solo is fun but can get boring fast. Overall a good game but still has a sorta grindly feel. Also alot of glitches and bugs that they seemed not to fix from the betas. Overall a 7/10 ghosts."

												First of all this is not a bad game. But for a 60€ AAA game it had far too many shortcomings.

Cons:
Writing: Every dialogue and every cutscene is either a parade of clichés or nonsense. Which made the ""story"" unsatisfying and at points laughable.
Voiceacting: Flat and monotone. Could have been done by random people simply reading from a page.
Glitches and bugs: There are alot and not all of them are small. For instance i have tried: 
1) No weapon will fire 
2) Can not use drone (this is important if you want/need to play stealthily) 
3) Rebel vehicle spawns on top of you and instantly kills you
And many other bugs.
AI) The AI of both the teammates (when playing solo) and enemies is quite bad, and at some points it ruins the experience.
Uplay: This is not entirely related to the game. But i dislike Uplay to put it mildly, and the microtransactions that go with it simply annoy me.

Pros:
Graphics: It looks amazing, even if my 980ti cannot pull off the full ultra setting. I should note that when i am driving fast the game is pulling data from the harddrive at 120 Mb/s (max for my harddrive) and my harddrive cannot keep up i think, so eventually the game freezes untill it has loaded the scenery. Quite annoying, but does not seem to happen as often when flying.
Stealth element: The feeling of satisfaction from completing a mission without ever being seen is really good.
Customization options: There are alot of options to customize both your own character and the weapons you choose to use.

In conclusion i would say this game lacks a few elements and a lot of polish and i would say a fair price for this game would have been 35-40€. As a last little example of this (NO spoilers): After completing the very last mission i spawn back into the world surrounded by 8 enemies who then proceed to murder me. Turning this moment of satisfaction into a joke."

												 Review 
This game isn't that bad and honestly I've been really enjoying it. The missions are somewhat repetitive, yes. It can get tiresome but I feel as like every approach is different. The main premise of the missions is usually snatch and grab however there isn't much way around it basing it off what would happen in a scenario as such. But the choices on how to deal with targets are fun. You can stealth it up or guns blazing or a little bit in between. 


The driving mechanics are a bit meh but I honestly didn't buy it expecting it to handle like Project Cars or anything like that so I'm honestly not dissapointed. The collisions between objects (since the beta) has improved significantly, you're no longer driving a 3 lb marshmellow around that floats down cliffs, cars feel like they have weight and although handles not the best, it feels nice. Flying is alright, nothing special. Helicopters: Hold down shift to a good height, hold w until it tilts down then bobs back up, let go of w and keep holding shift. Planes: Hold shift and ocasionally (besides landing and take-off) press w and s.

Gunplay and customization are really outstanding here. You can change virtually everything about your gun and the amount of guns are very pleasing. The attatchments and guns aren't all given to you but you must gather intel in that region to find out where attatchments and different guns are located at. Characters also have a good deal of customization to make your character feel like they are ""yours"". 

Overall, I feel like this game is worth a try and with combining beta hours to this, I have logged 21 hours and feel as if this game still isn't stale and should be on to pickup, albiet, if skeptical (beyond anything, even after looking up gameplay), definitely wait for a sale.

            Catagory        Rating (1-10)                Character Customization        8                Campaign        6.5                Guns        9                Vehicles        6                Map        9.5                Coop Experience        10              OVERALL        8.5      


I'm using an i7-2600 @ 3.40 GHz, 16 GB RAM, and a Sapphire R9 390 Nitro and get around 65 fps and this game is optimized for Nvidia cards, I'll be switching when the 1080ti comes out though."

												Wildlands has been a blast so far! It's a great game to coop with your friends and even without coop, it's still pretty fun. It basically feels like an enhanced, more detailed version of Far Cry 4 with a mix of The Division, in a good way. I heard they are adding some PvP elements to the game in the future, which will add yet another layer of fun."

												So far so good. It has the typical Ubisoft grind, but I found this game a lot more enjoyable than the typical Far Cry/Assassin's Creed games. To be honest I put the difficulty on normal and just absolutely faceroll the enemies. This game does a good job making you feel like a tactical badass and I enjoy the varied locations. I don't know if it was worth $60 but it's not a bad game at all. I have yet to play it with friends, this is single player only."

									Product received for free

												This game is honesty god awful Heres WHY:
1. The voice acting is lazy I just hear the same thing over and over again. I.E. La ♥♥♥♥♥♥ culeros and ♥♥♥♥ balls. 

2. I dont care about the character for examle Weaver is just black guy with a sniper rifle. 

3. The bosses' weapons are abosolute garbage. You can't customize them like put a silencer on them so they are basically useless.
 
4. The Missions are repetitive
 
5. You cant get in the back of a truck. It is in the ♥♥♥♥ing trailer and screenshot loading screens wtf. You can't shoot in the trunks of the SUV.

6. The Weapons: You can just look up the best guns in the game and not spend anytime using different guns, so all the different guns are useless. (should have been lvl based)

7. The bosses not hard at all even on the hardest difficulty. Example: For one of the bosses I just drove an explosive drone to him and killed him. 

8. You can't choose which vehicale you can spawn. I don't want to spawn in a god damn helicopter every ♥♥♥♥ing time.

9. Lazy voice acting design: When I am playing Coop with people the main character voice switches to different people. Also there two players and 4 people talking. 

10. Your teamates are useless when doing convoys missions.

11. The convoy missions are all the same 2 cars and 1 trucks.
 
12. In my opinion the game is not very difficult. I am playing on the hardest difficulty and the game is still easy.
 
13. There is more just cant think of them. (cont.) 

14. Customize your character: the Saturation is all wrong with the tops. It does not match the legs

15. The A.I. look all the same. For example the Lt. all look like cholos and rebels faces are all the same. Also the Unidad and cartel look the same. ( i am talking about the faces)

All in all the Ubisoft is lazy company make decent to ♥♥♥♥ games and I would score this to be a 5 out of 10 so Meh. In The End customize your guy is more fun than the game.

Playing with friends is funny because we ♥♥♥♥ around but the actual game is ok."

												One of the best open world adventure game with a huge map probably 3X greater than GTA V . Full of missions which will keep you busy all the time in this open world. Very much tactical gaming required , need much plans for doing missions stealthily and can approach a mission in various ways . Difficulty level hard is fun in playing and gives much of reality and the scenary is just speechless , the graphics they have is just fabulous , feels like real world . But there are some glitches bugs which needs to be fixed as soon as possible and need to add some more activities like racing. They should also increase the survival level in the game . Lots of framedrops also occurs which needs to be fixed . Overall its a nice game to buy and play . Its worth of money if you see the scenary only they have made. Buy it if your pc configuration is good enough to play in high settings."

Great action and open world is .. I love it ... 
If you liked The Division, this game should already be in your library because its similar .

Other than the driving mechanics i would rate this game 8/10 honestly . 

I have yet to experience any bugs or glitches yet but its still kind of early but i love it ."

												PROS:

+ Satisfying weapons simulation
+ Shooting in total just works great
+ Incredibly huge world
+ Amazing multiplayer experience, with emergent game play
+ Love all the weapon unlocks and the Weaponsmith
+ Rich atmosphere
+ Knock out graphics (if you have the hardware)

CONS:

- PC Flight Controls are awful
- Squad AI needs work
- Can get a bit boring when playing single player
- Bullet Drop is a bit too severe
- Still a bit buggy
- Micro-transactions for in game goodies 


All and all, an amazing ""Go visit foreign lands, meet interesting new people, and kill them"" simulation. Off the charts multiplayer experience, with incredible emergent game play scenarios. Shooting is very satisfying, with immediate feedback present. Easy customization of HUD Elements to make the game  into more of a difficult military tac-ops simulation. 

Some for the most fun I have had playing a game in my 35 years of video gaming (multiplayer)."

												The Division was just a demo...this is the final release...and it is damn good. 

No bugs, full game on release, and the map is about 20 times the size of The Divison with full freedom of travel in any vehicle that you choose...or you can walk like a man.

Ubisoft? Is that you?

												Let's be real:

Everyone thought that this game was going to be Division 2.0. With the open area, everyone though the game was going to fail. It did the opposite. This game has something unique about it which other games dont do, Which Division didn't do. This game is amazing. The different ways you can either get to a point in the map, or just the way you can do missions. Everything is different. You can either go stelth and not been seen at all, or go full out rambo and ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up. All in all, if you have the money, get this game. It is worth it. It has so much replay value to it. Ive completed the game around 70-75% (My stats say that) And when i do complete this game 100%, I will end up replaying this game in a completly different aspect. My current play through (60 hours) I was so keen on being stelthy and keeping a certain playstyle but really, who cares? Go in guns blazing!

All in all this game is amazing, I would reccomend this game over any over game any day!

												the game is.....fun.... but i cant reccomend it if your planning on playing alone its is definetly a friends needed game, the AI isent bad or anything....as a matter of fact they are so good it makes it kinda easy....but with friends you have to time shots and use strategy to get through missions.....not to mention all the insuing chaos.

games beatiful i run it at around 50-80 fps on ultra setting long shadows and enchanced god rays and nvida turf and hbao on loading screens are kinda long but i end up with a smooth running game and now missing textures. weapon custimization is pretty cool and im glad you cant just use everything right off the bat and have to work for it but.....it is anyoing at times since i need to go through a whole military base just to get a scope for my assualt rifle but its all part of the kit. overall rating 8.5/10"

												Overall the game is fine. Could it be better, of course it could be. The AI are kind of dumb, the driving is blockey but the game for me ran fine with 60-70 fps with FX8350 and SLI GTX 1070. I have yet to play co-op but in the single player experience I found it to be fun but sometimes repetitive and that is with only 3 hours currently logged, hopefully I will find new experiences as I continue to play. In a way this game reminds me of Mercenaries 2 and that is not entirely a bad thing. Do I recommend buying it at 60 bucks.... no wait till a sale for like 40 bucks and till some updates are released as I have read of quite a few FPS issues along with CPU hogging."

												TL;DRProbably the best tactical coop shooter currently available. Console port; great graphics options but easy, even on Extreme despite decent shooter underpinnings; turning off minimap and avoiding regular intel caches helps. A lot of fun with friends, easy drop-in/drop-out, tolerates shenanigans/alcohol well. Lovely flourishes like flora mechanics and dirt/mud.

edit: Later missions are more challenging, esp ones with differing objectives like grabbing targets alive or defend for a period of time. Rebel missions are all the same, story missions have decent variety.

The Division? Really?The Division is an mmo looter, this is not; anyone who says otherwise is nuts. True, character customization/weapons loadouts are similar but gun upgrades/pickups are completely static; that's ok because this isn't meant to be a looter! You'll figure out some weapons you like or need if you're specializing and use them most of the time because the focus is on being a shooter. Which is also why, unlike Division, there are no bullet sponges (ok maybe choppers and such but it makes sense that an armored vehicle would take longer to bring down, a good marksmen can take out the passengers). Note that this is in Extreme, I do NOT recommend playing it any other way.

GraphicsAre good, lots of options for pcs, decent view distance but sometimes wonky LOD. Performance has improved since beta. Lots of cool touches; grass compresses and moves, sugar cane gets pushed out of the way as you walk through it, vehicles take on dirt realistically. In an early plane stealing mission our group got some dirt on the wingtip when we dipped it into the runway slightly. Mud gets on vehicles in ways you expect. If your gamma is set correctly day and night differences are pretty good, night vision is necessary but worth turning off occasionally to see the sights.

AtmosphereMuch less empty than Mad Max and doesn't get increasingly empty as you go, plenty of NPCs moving around making it feel relatively lived in, enemies don't completely disappear (good or bad but at least early on retaking of compounds you wipe out make sense and Unidad should probably be relatively permanent), rebel activity increases as you help out. Maybe more empty compared to GTA, I'm also a guy who's used to driving around empty ArmA 3 maps.

MechanicsReasonably crunchy tactical shooter, in Extreme headshots are deadly (even body shots with high caliber), bullet penetration exists but feels wonky sometimes. LMG and high caliber snipers can pierce wooden fences and thin metal walls but canvas tents are disturbingly sturdy. Overall its much less crunchy than ArmA 3 but good enough. Primary focus of game is shooting things, kinda reminds me of simple fun killtower maps in Raven Shield but with more to do. There is bullet drop but no atmosphere, long range sniping is reasonably challenging but can get frusrating if LOD doesn't show you that there's an obstruction between you and your target. Overall, entertaining and reasonably rewarding; don't feel like NPCs cheat, good marksmanship and tactics pay off, just wish it wasn't quite so easy to rambo. Again, only play on Extreme!

With the variety of things to do and a lack of arbitrary enforcement of approaches it's possible to do some clever things, esp with a well coordinated squad. For example, parachuting is pretty fun, flight ceiling is reasonably high, AI are reasonably aware: HALO insertion with a decently coordinated squad can be very entertaining. Belaboring the point a bit here, while it's not a milsim like ArmA 3 there's enough there to make it fun. Pop too soon and you're a sitting duck likely to get gunned down, pop too late and you faceplant, land in the middle of the bad guys and they'll get riled up potentially calling reinforcements and really making things pear-shaped.

VehiclesAre ok. Cars aren't as bad to me as some others say, feels decent when climbing a hill in a heavy vehicle vs a bike with slide and so on. Bikes feel a bit too solid to me and the APC can get wonky. Helicopters and airplanes are... ok. Pretty sad there's no real yaw, helicopters aren't terribly realistic. Not a lot of potential for derring-do but they'll get you places and can serve as aerial shooting platforms. Drone is launchable from vehicles.

ChallengeBiggest con is that it is too easy. I'd be even happier with the light crunch of the tactical shooter side if I wasn't spoonfed literally everything all the time. Kinda typical open-world Ubi bs I suppose, maybe to cater to console. Mad Max was similar but I haven't played many others (used to avoid on principle); Mad Max was better if you avoided Stronghold upgrades so similarly here I recommend avoiding major intel caches. At least here you can turn UI elements off and I recommend turning off at least the minimap. Game improves significantly if you're having to actually recon and discover/explore things on your own. You can always turn it back on later if you need to scratch that completionist itch or if your coop partners aren't willing.

Overall there is a lot here that doesn't rely on lame openworld mechanics so even in the worst case it's enjoyable. Just wish it was better."

												My review for this will be short; It's an objectively good game, and I thought it would be just my type of game (I love Far Cry, GTA, MGSV, etc) but Wildlands feels like a dry, substandard mixing of those games. Combat feels unsatisfying for whatever reason, the stealth is either too overpowered or not good enough. The amount of times I should or shouldn't have been seen just based on normal ""I am behind a wall, how did he see me"" logic is insane. I played singleplayer, and it felt like an empty world with little personality. I feel like it could be fun with a group of friends, but in my opinion it is not a fun singleplayer experience"

												Random Thoughts:
-Prepare to die if you think you can rambo past 2nd tier difficulty. 
-Video clips are great, as well as the actual story (probably top 3 stand alone stories for ubisoft imo)
-Driving in the actual bolivian mountain ranges is probably easier. 
-10/10 negative reviewers need to learn how to optimize in game settings."

												Let's not straightly go to criticize Ubisoft. They made a good game that's for sure. The huge game world looks magnificant. Some bugs are still there. They definitely gonna release some patches. What I can possibly say is - It's not a technical success, not a technical disaster either. 

Do I recommend it? Yes if you have a descent rig and got some buddies to play with. You NAT Type must be open in order connect. So keep that in mind. Only one player with strict NAT can join a lobby hosted by the player with open NAT Type. If one strict NAT joins then another strict NAT cannot join. There are ways to open your NAT. Just google it or contact ISP. :) 

Will update the review as more I play."

												This is a great game, despite the cirle-jerk about ubisoft. Ubisoft seems to be supporting the game to the fullest, with updates fixing issues in a timely manner. The graphics are great, as well  as hitboxes. The weapon choices are amazing, they give you a wide choice of playstyle. The approach of the freedom of this game is true to its word. You can do what you want, when you want. There's nothing to hold you back except your own skill and stratagy. There's a lot of hate for this game just because it's made by ubisoft, but let me say this. Don't be a ♥♥♥♥, give them a chance and actually play this game instead of jerkin yourself off over your hate."

												Graphics, effects, lightning and game dynamics feel smooth and look great. Running on a solid rig though Intel 6800K @3.9GHz, 980 Ti with 64GB memory. The character build menus, the inventory management and the endless options in weapons are all well executed. A big plus, you don't have to spend hours upon hours finding crafting materials, you can straight up buy all the weapons you want before you even take your first steps in the game. It seems Ubisoft finally realized there are plenty of casual gamers who want to have *all* the tools to be able to play on high difficulty settings but for limited amounts of time in between family, life and work.
Only question that remains when my co-op buddy joins, will the AI be difficult enough?"

												First i would lke to say that this game is nothing like the division.  So many people are giving this game a bad rap, but honestly me and my brother have been playing this game for about 3 days now and its amazing.  we chose how we take our targets down and it only gets more complex as you level up.  Anyone saying this is a bad game is not playing it right.  Also this is a time where good coop games are hard to come by.... i mean lets be real there are no good coop games these days and Wildlands nailed that aspect this game is a blast with friends.  If you dont try to speed run like an idiot and you play the way a stealth ghost recon is meant to be played you will be rewarded. Me and my brother have over 10hrs in the game and are only on the second of 20 areas i let you do the math.  To summerize this game has a ton of content and customization and coming from the corp the military lingo and jokes are pretty spot on.  All in all i toataly recomend this game to any prior military looking to play with friends or brothers."

												Just cause meets tactical shooter. Not a dull moment so far. While this is by no means the most challenging 'tactical shooter' ever, it is very entertaining. Large map, lots of weapons and equipment to play pretty much however you want."

												This game is great so far. Im around 15 hours in and I have been playing on the 2nd highest difficulty and have been on a mission to collect weapons and attachments. The AI seems a little slow unless you are playing on the highest difficulty, and the friendly AI is clueless, so definately play co-op. Once I am in a co-op game, it is very difficult in the higher zones. The starting zones seem easy and meant to just get you going with how to play. The higher level areas and Unidad F.O.B's really test your stealth. Definately worth taking a look at. I think alot of these reviews are based on only the first zone or two and can't be taken as a full review of the game. Make sure you check time played. If its < 4 hours, they probably didn't see the full game. Bottom line is this is a fantastic game, and it is a ton of fun with friends. Check it out."

												After, about 40 hours of gameplay.  I have to say. i am not totally hooked. but i did enjoy it. minor some annoyances.

This game had the potential to be, the best game ever made. but then it fell short. 

here are the pros:

Incredibly amazing graphics that  Runs smootly, spanning over a huge map.
The combat and AI are Above what you would consider Average. 
The Story line and acting is somewhat captivating. 
Performance wise, this game is gold. with just a few bugs i encountered. (Called for SUV, landed on my head and killed me). but this only happened once. 

some of the silly things

Game has a little bit of the MAD max sandbox syndrome. A little, not entirely that much. 
See i enjoyed MAdMAx, but having or feeling like you have to do all those side repetetive grind tasks on the side can be dreary. and until now i still havent finished the game. In Ghost i feel like it might end up the same way.
As i said, the story line it self is brilliant. but since the game needs you to do all the side tasks to improve your self. well.

prepare to do 24 times each of the following.
Steal helicopter, steal plane, steal truck, Attack sattelite relay, press E on two Towers 1km apart in 1min time.
Tag a supply drop, and deffend a radio relay, and i think scare soem guy to death by shouting crpa in his ears.....etc? maybe i missed one or two.

See after doing this maybe 7 times now, i really dont wanna do it again, and yet i have to. anyways. I just wish Sandbox games would do less with this repetetive nonesense. I dont mind that i have seen some bases more than once. (copy and paste) I dont mind as there are lots of variety still. and you do feel like you are really in an entire country. I trully enjoyed flying or boating down river. its trully a visual experience on a 34 in screen at least.

in a nutsehll, i really feel like they missed out on an opportunity to make something truly epic. with all the rooms they had to play with. they could have shown GTA V how you can do it better. but then again. GTA spent 300m$.

MUTIPLAYER CO-OP.

Unless its your friends on MIC COMS. just dont bother. 3  AI are more fun, have better things to say. and can be assinged to SYNC shoot. so you can kill 4 ore more in one hit. really. dont bother palying with randoms. just takes longer and it spoils the sequencin of your campign map. 

anyways, i hope you enjoy the game."

												This is a truly hidden gem. I mean at first I liked the graphics, but not so much. The control of the vehicles was a bit meh, everything seemed generic not to mention there's no actual storyline except for a few cutscenes here and there, that are passable. 

First encounters AI is like pretty much in every other game. Sneak, kill, whatever. So I was prepared for yet another generic shoot 'em up with no story (not that i care so much) like every other game out there. And I was so not ready for what was yet to come.

Once you get past the easy areas and try something harder the AI starts to shine in a way I have never seen before, and I've seen a lot. It's simply mind blowing, they will call the army to hunt you down, there are going to be inbound choppers on your location, the AI will pin you down and try to flank you in every possible way. They will leave their base and come to rush you on open areas! You will try and run and hide and they will pursue, in the night, with flashlights, through the grass, use the terrain to their advantage and every other trick in the book. 

And you are going to die for every stupid stunt you're trying to pull against the AI. You're going to die a lot, just like in real life combat. And all that on a map so huge you're not going to believe it's even possible. My mind was completely blown. 

The images will still haunt you for hours after you are done playing. The beautiful scenery, the amazing gameplay and the frighteningly close to reality AI, all make for a massive true war zone like experience like I never had experienced before. 10/10 from me on this one guys, it's a must for every military simulation nut out there."

-Weapon Customization
-Servers (So far so good)
-Gameplay/Story

Cons: 
-Vehicle Mechanics. (Similar like Watch Dogs 2)
-Screen Tearing (Even with Vsync and Nvidia Adaptive Sync).
-Micro Stutter.

												Graphics, effects, lightning and game dynamics feel smooth and look great. Running on a solid rig though Intel 6800K @3.9GHz, 980 Ti with 64GB memory. The character build menus, the inventory management and the endless options in weapons are all well executed. A big plus, you don't have to spend hours upon hours finding crafting materials, you can straight up buy all the weapons you want before you even take your first steps in the game. It seems Ubisoft finally realized there are plenty of casual gamers who want to have *all* the tools to be able to play on high difficulty settings but for limited amounts of time in between family, life and work.
Only question that remains when my co-op buddy joins, will the AI be difficult enough?"

												Well, I guess aftrr slaying 6 cartel thugs head of in about 9 hours I could really make a review on this. To make it easy for everyone to see, ill just make a Pro and Cons list.
PRO's
丶This game has a MASSIVE map, id say three or four times of gtav
丶This game has lots of things to do, unlike gtav online which is so boring after you bought all the cars you can and done all the mission you can
丶This game has a easy to learn combat system(i played all kinds of fps and by far it is the best game ive played)
丶This games stalking and recon systems are also done extremely well, there is almost 0 bugs
丶This game has a very good envoronment, when your playing the game it really puts you as operators in a brutal South American country to take out thugs
CON's
丶This game is very expensive
丶The dlc's in game such as face color and skins are also very expensive
丶This game can run at least if you have a gtx960 video card(I use gtx 1060)
丶This game will need you to find real-life teammates and use mics to talk with them in order to do missions faster
丶The AI's on both sides are sometimes very dull
丶This game requires uplay, which will be hard to sign up in regions like China
SUMMARY:
To sum it up, I mostly recommend this game, very very much, however , I do not agree it is ubi's best sandbox game, I believe steep is(in my heart).Hope you liked my review, p.s. this game will be very easy if you have played any ubi game before, such as watch_dogs."

												This is a console to PC port.   Was very optimistic about this game but after playing it for a couple days I sort of regret getting it.  It's like an Assassin's Creed/Far Cry rehash of the same exact game, just with paramilitary aspects.  Marketed to play as solo but the AI is so worthless.  My biggest complaints is the controls, and this is where you really tell its a console port.  It's all clunky, it's like they don't realize its a pc.  Heavily disappointed,"

												This game is a solid 8/10 with the potential to be a 9/10. I enjoy the dialogue between the ghosts...makes you feel like a squad. I'm only able to run this on medium (until I get a better GPU) and it looks pretty fine; Not great but okay.  Gameplay makes me feel like GTA/Farcry, go figure, right? At the moment I've only put in +10 hours and I'm playing solo so I can't imagine the gameplay with a squad. So official decision is......if you're hyped for this and willing to pay $60 then go for it if not wait until it goes on sale."

Looks great, minor fps issues still linger but pretty fantastically optimized.


I can't tell ya much about the kids difficulties but throwing this ♥♥♥♥ on the hardest makes things pretty intense like realism mode tends to do in Tom Clancy games.


Play with your friends, that was one of the main selling points of the game. Games are boring if you make them boring, stop expecting Call of Duty to come out for the first time again its a military shooter for christ's sake."

												Huge open world with lots of things to do.
Me and my friends has been playing for 12+ hours ""Day One"" and ONLY completed 2 mission, not that we died all the time we explored, did sidemissions and more.
I can only say im very impressed with this game,
the play style, multiple weapon modifications, clothing, styling of your character.
One thing im missing is when you play as a team, when you find Food, gas, comm and med supplies EVERYONE has to take it to get it and NOT devided to all in the team. In singleplayer mode its ok, multi NOT ok.
Overall the game is great"

												This is my first Ghost Recon game so I might have a more sentimental than critical view on the game generally. I got really frustrated at first especially due to the stuttering problem I was having with the game which definitely had nothing to do with my PC specs. I felt like if I had written the review before I got it fixed, it would probably have been a thumbs down because the game is really promising. I like the whole idea behind the plot and the game setting even though its not exactly accurate. Not veryexpansive with character customization but the variety in outfits makes up for it, sort of. It also comes with a good number of guns that we probably know and love from the division and battlefield franchises, most of which have to be retrieved or bought. I dont see it having a high replay value though once the boss has been taken care of. Sure, there are rebel missions and skill missions that can be undertaken after but it is rendered moot once the goal of the game has been accomplished unless you want to completely take over with maxed out rebel support and player skills. All in all, I think its a very good game that will be fun playing both with friends and solo as the AI are fully engaged and tactical as well (sometimes I prefer using them to actual players), I'm excited for what the game has in store for the near future and I really hope it gets new content!"

												Ghost Recon Wildlands is attempting to mix so many games for it's own good.

BUT, it manages to do what it does have rather nicely.

 Pros 

Good Graphics
Great multiplayer fun
Interesting story
Has a decent amount of humor here and there. (Especially the General joke, told pretty early on)

 Cons 

Blatantly broke AI (Reference video below)
Stealth mechanics need work
As mentioned prior, AI needs work.
Basically required to play online for a non idiot AI experience
Pleeenty of bugs. (But we are Day 1 release)


 Story 
You are a member of a 4 member 'Ghost' squad, employed to bring down the Santa Blanca cartel, located in Bolivia, that has kidnapped, murdered, and overall has created chaos, you will accomplish this mission by bringing down the leaders of the cartel, one at a time, while along the way, increasing the Rebel's ability to fight, making your life a lot easier.


 Final Verdict 
If you have it already, give it a chance, if you don't. Give it a few months for the bug fixes to come in. (We all remember Battlefield 4 launch)

I run the game at a decent 80-90 FPS, My specs are as follows
 
I7 7700 Kaby Lake
ROG Maximus IX
32GB DDR4 Gskill Trident
SLI'd 1070's

I've had no issues loading the game.

												like other reviewers have stated, a new release should not really be weighed exclusively on its performance issues at launch, so my reccomendation comes based on the following.


1. game looks nice, and the world is very big, If you are one of the people that is satisfied with the game play, you are going to get a LOT for your initial investment.
2. a lot of immersion, customizations, skills and stuff to keep you pushing to stregthen your character. TONS of weapons and upgrades, (although im pretty sure you could pass any mission with the start up kit).
3. switching between solo and co-op play is easy, and both sides are equally fun to me. its a pretty good challenge to put the game on max difficulty and try to solo the story missions. its also pretty rad to get into a group and just wreck havoc on everything.


I have seen people crying about the driving, but its no where near as bad as watch dogs 2 or any of the mafia games. it may not quite have the physics dialed in like GTA5, but it works. plus some vehicles have guns, and I actually like the helicopters...

when approaching an outpost , you need to be careful which side you come in from. If there are cliffs ringing the area, you almost always have to approach from another angle , because the climbing is pretty much useless other than small hops and low ledge pull ups. This is one of my only complaints. I'm pretty sure these elite spec op dudes could find more routes up these rocky areas, at least establish some ropes or climbing anchors like other games, so you don't spend 10 minutes skirting a hilltop outpost looking for a way in. 

Ive seen this game compared to the division, and i can draw the same comparisons only asthetically. In the division, the enemies are damage sponges, where a well placed headshot only pulls the NPC. In this game , your aim actually matters, and headshots on normal enemies are one shot kills.

the tactical and stealth mechanics are pretty light, dont expect AI on the level of Dishonored2, but that said, on the max difficulty the bots are pretty nasty. they notice fallen commrades and go on hunt mode, and their aim is ....well ...bot like. this can make for either frustrating or rewarding gameplay, depending on your personal level of patience and willingness to watch and plan. in the end if the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, you can go loud, and even be revived once pre battle by your team mates, if it goes really sideways.


the voice acting is pretty meh, but ive seen a lot worse in AAA titles.

in this day and age , gamers are ever critical of new games, so make sure you are reading into reviews for the things that are important to you, rather than just going by the ratio of good to bad reviews. very few games hit the mark on every box, but this game hits enough of them for me to enjoy it and give it the thumbs up."

												So far so good. It has the typical Ubisoft grind, but I found this game a lot more enjoyable than the typical Far Cry/Assassin's Creed games. To be honest I put the difficulty on normal and just absolutely faceroll the enemies. This game does a good job making you feel like a tactical badass and I enjoy the varied locations. I don't know if it was worth $60 but it's not a bad game at all. I have yet to play it with friends, this is single player only."

												Wildlands is a tactical third-person squad shooter set in a large open world to use as your playground. It plays as a mix between Farcry, Just Cause and The Division and features 4 player drop-in-out seamless co-op.

The game features a lot of what you would expect - vehicles, guns, stealth, explosions, tactical mission planning, massive world to explore, unlocks and skill points. You are given a wealth of gadgets to help you in your missions which can be upgraded to your liking. The long distance sniper may want to invest some points to steady their aim and improve the drone's range and battery, where-as the commando may want improved bullet resistance, mines, C4 and more grenades. When playing in co-op, you can each specialise in a certain area to improve your team's effectiveness and playing to each individual's strengths. Some other noteworthy skills/features include the ability to call for reinforcements, request a mortar strike, summon vehicles, create diversions, use flares, thermal vision and much more. There is so many cool things to invest in that you are spoilt for choice and invariably want them all.

Although perfectly playable in single player, the fun of this game is when you get a group of friends together for some co-op mayhem. The open-ended ""freeform"" gameplay allows you to approach missions in a number of different ways, depending on your play style. Nothing quite beats the feeling of a well planned ambush coming together when all 4 of your squad are coordinating the fight. Things invariably go terribly wrong too - and trying to claw your way back after a mess-up can be a challenge and rewarding experience too.

Graphically it looks wonderful and the sound is also very well done. Controls are a bit of a mixed bag. On foot, things are largely fine - but vehicles suffer from a few issues. Wheeled vehicles all seem a little too ""slidey"" and the helicopter controls were clearly designed by Satan himself - they are dreadful. To actually be able to fly the thing without pulling my hair out, I had to look online, where I found an awesome explanation of how it works, how to actually control it and how insanely absurd it all is when other games can get this right so often (those interested, check out here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildlands/comments/5w7y8f/guide_how_to_pilot_the_helicopter/). These things you will eventually get used to, but in this day and age, you shouldn't have too. If the developers had put a little more thought into it then it could drastically improve your time with the game.

The game also has a few latent bugs left over (which I am sure will get fixed over the coming months). Nothing *too* game breaking, for the most part. Although one nasty bug in particular plagued our co-op group, whereby a certain weapon unlock became completely inaccessible and required us all to start fresh new games (luckily this happened early on!). If such a thing had happened after 20+ hours of gameplay, I am sure my review would not be so kind. Mostly though, bugs are actually quite amusing - for instance: I was playing single player and was on the outskirts of a main story mission base. I invited a friend to join my game. As they did, the base exploded, completed the mission for me and alerted every enemy nearby. Weird, to be sure. Spazzing helicopters are also hilarious to watch.

The story isn't much good either to be honest. But when the core of the game is all about free-form gameplay and doing things ""your way"", I can forgive this because it is simply really good fun.

The bottom line: Great fun with 3 friends. Anyone that has wanted a co-op Farcry experience may find this right up their street. It's not perfect, but it is a hell of a lot of fun.

												Really fun open world millitary shooter. Lots of bugs and glitches but thats expected for a game of this size still in the first week of its release (although it would be nice if they can be fixed asap because some bugs are game breaking) luckily the game autosaves pretty well so you don't lose progress. Game is also a little repetative but it's fun so doesn't really bother me. Anyway, the game has a huge map with different terrains, lots of missions and side missions, graphics are amazing, and co-op can be fun if you're playing with friends. Vehicle controls are a little weird but easy to get used to. This game really reminds me of the Just Cause series, so if you're into that game you will defiantly like this one. Overall it's a great game with lots of hours of gameplay (about 16 hours in so far and Im probably at about 5% progress) and will keep you playing for hours on end. Highly recommend"

												English:This game redefines the lower limit of optimization. You will encounter countless frozen moments, loading issues, bugs and glitches with different aspects such as drones, map pins, etc.

Gameplaywise, the story, at least to me, is minimal. Your squad is assigned to Bolivia to take out the Santa Blanca drug cartel piece by piece. Maybe it's because I haven't finished the entire storyline, but so far everything is just standard in terms of story. Nothing will blow your mind. And this game, just like all recent Ubisoft single player open world games, has the typical Ubisoft-type collection. Although they are optional, some of them are rather feeling ""mandatory"" as you need skill points and resources to upgrade you skills, which are rather helpful in terms of taking out enemies and taking over different locations. Graphically speaking, the game is beautiful, which in turn will require a higher-end PC if you want to fully experience the beauty of nature in Bolivia.

In terms of performance issues, like I said above, you will experience frozen moments, especially if you are in vehicles, which include land vehicles like cars, water vehicles like boats and air vehicles like choppers and planes. As annoying as it is, most of the time you just need to wait for 2-5 seconds before it turns back to normal, but this problem is rather critical in some missions with time limit. Just beware that in missions with time limit, if your game freezes in the middle, your position after the freezing will not change but the time passed during the freezing is deducted from the timer. In order to reduce the frequency of such freezing just lower your drawing distance in graphics setting. This will effectively reduce the frequency of freezing but will NOT remove it from the game. There is not much we can do.

The spotting system is also pretty inconsistent. Sometimes when you drive pass enemies you are just ""suspected"" which means you are fine as long as you keep driving away from them; sometimes when you drive pass enemies they will spot you immediately and start shooting at you. This will directly increase the difficulty especially when you are doing ""car-stealing"" missions or similar.

Am I recommending this game to others? It depends. If you can stand somewhat severe performance issues and like the world settings in this game as well as like collecting stuff, then yes, this is a game for you. However, if you are not really into the world settings or you can't stand bad performance at all, then don't pick this up because I don't think they will fix the performance issues soon as it's still rather severe after being released for more than 10 days.

Final Verdict: 6/10. Could play if you want, but you are not really missing anything if you don't.

简体中文：这个游戏重新定义了优化的下限。在游戏中你会遇到数不胜数的卡顿、加载问题以及其他各种各样的bug，买bug送游戏并非空穴来风。

关于游戏本身来讲，剧情对我来说几乎等于不存在。你的小队被派遣到玻利维亚去瓦解圣塔布兰卡贩毒集团就是整个游戏的主线。可能是因为我还没过完主线任务，但是目前来说整体剧情非常中规中矩，没有任何出彩的地方。而且这个游戏和育碧其它的开放世界单人游戏一样有经典的育碧式收集系统。虽然理论上来说这些收集内容都不是强制的，但是在游戏过程中它们会给你一种强制性的感觉，因为你需要收集技能点和资源来升级你的技能，这些技能又对击杀敌人和占领据点很有帮助，所以有时候还是不得不收集的。游戏的画面还算不错，但是相应的也需要较高端的PC才能完全欣赏玻利维亚的美景。

关于游戏的表现问题，最常见的就是我上面说过的游戏卡顿，尤其是当你驾驶载具的时候。这包括像汽车这类的陆地载具、船这类的水上载具以及直升机和飞机这类的空中载具。尽管这个问题很烦人但是大多数情况下你只需要等2-5秒游戏就会恢复正常。但是有时候这个问题还是很致命的，尤其是当你在做一些有时间限制的任务的时候。需要注意的是在做有时间限制的任务的时候如果你遭遇了卡顿，虽然卡顿结束后你的位置没变但是卡顿时消耗的时间会从总时间里面扣除。如果想要减少卡顿发生的频率的话就在画面设置里面降低绘图距离。这样可以减少卡顿发生的频率但是不会完全消除卡顿。

游戏中的警觉系统也给人一种很生硬的感觉。有时候你从敌人旁边开车经过的时候只会“被怀疑”，也就是说只要你开车离敌人远远的就没事；有时候你开车从敌人旁边经过的时候敌人立刻就发现你然后朝你射击。这种不连贯性会在你做偷车类任务的时候直接增加游戏难度。

我会不会向别人推荐这款游戏呢？因人而异。如果你可以忍受这种近乎严重的卡顿问题并且对游戏的故事背景很感兴趣而且热爱收集的话，这款游戏很适合你。但是，如果你对游戏背景设定不感冒或者完全无法忍受一丁点的卡顿的话，千万别买这游戏。我不认为在游戏发售超过10天之后整体表现并无好转的情况下育碧会在近期修复这些游戏表现问题。

最终评分：6/10。如果你愿意的话当然可以买来玩，但是就算你不玩的话也没有错过什么值得一玩的内容。"

												Let's be real:

Everyone thought that this game was going to be Division 2.0. With the open area, everyone though the game was going to fail. It did the opposite. This game has something unique about it which other games dont do, Which Division didn't do. This game is amazing. The different ways you can either get to a point in the map, or just the way you can do missions. Everything is different. You can either go stelth and not been seen at all, or go full out rambo and ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up. All in all, if you have the money, get this game. It is worth it. It has so much replay value to it. Ive completed the game around 70-75% (My stats say that) And when i do complete this game 100%, I will end up replaying this game in a completly different aspect. My current play through (60 hours) I was so keen on being stelthy and keeping a certain playstyle but really, who cares? Go in guns blazing!

All in all this game is amazing, I would reccomend this game over any over game any day!

												Simply put, the potential is there, but the game is flawed, often making it unplayable. One of these flaws is the cover system, which allows the player to simply bump up against a wall or building and go into cover, which in theory could have been something good, something that added to the game; and yet it does little to that effect, often being unreliable and clunky, with the cover ofent doing little to protect against opponents. A second slightly minor flaw is the shoulder switching, allowing you to switch between right and left shoulders. This is often useful, actually adding to the gameplay, by allowing you to round corners with lime of sight and such, but when entering or exiting cover, the game has a tendency to pick a side at random, often leaving you aiming into walls or away from the target.
The third is the respawns, which are mildly odd at best and brain numbingly stupid at worst, and you may say 'if you where good, you wouldnt need to respawn', well im pretty ♥♥♥♥, so i need to respwan alot.
And lastly, the thing that makes me not want to recommend this game, is the AI, both enemy and friendly/ally. the enemy AI has one form of engagement, 2 if you count snipers and helicopters, to slowly or rapidly rush towards the player, often in groups  of 3-4, though sometimes more. the second is snipers and helicopters, oppting to try to snipe you from their nests. This leads to the player simply needing to herd the AI into a funnel and to then mow them down, like the brain dead beings they sometimes resemble. The ally AI is no better, with 'protect' missions being RNG ♥♥♥♥fests, as to whether the vip runs into enemy fire or takes cover, or simply getting one-shotted, failing the mission, and having to restart. 

Although I have been negative through out, if you have 3 friends, and dont mind the odd/erratic AI then i would recommend this to you. though i really think ubi need to up their game on missions types and optimization, i had fun for a while atleast."

												Pros:
Beautiful game, huge map (I forget that there must be a boundary somewhere). 
Lot's of non-linear play, I was flying to a mission and saw a plane shot down (nothing to do with me). I went to investigate, found supplies to mark, and a lead for a whole list of side missions.
Makes me want to play multiplayer.  I'm a die hard single player gamer, and I'm already (after 3 hours) excited to join some co-op groups this weekend.

Con:
AI overall is good, but I'd like to see more tactics from enemies.
There is no reason not to just drive like a maniac from point to point, I'd like my actions to possibly draw attention?  Raise my profile (maybe unidad sends a patrol to check on the pickup that went crashing through the jungle)

I can easily see this game being my go to shooter for quite some time."

												At fisrt i thought oh no another open world game from ubisoftt, but then I started playing a bit just to see how the gameplay feels like, and its actually farely decent, they still have much work to put in regarding vehicle controls, but otherwise everything is great, you get tons of tweaks for the graphic settings, the game even lets you run benchmark for your own custom graphic options, and speaking of customization, holy ♥♥♥♥ does this game have it, obviously you dont get crazy character customizations option like an elderscroll game, but the amount of clothes, gears, gun parts you can tweak to your liking is absolutely fantastic.

I recommend this game to people who likes open world and third person shooters, i dont recommend this game to people who wants a great story or FPS fans, it's really different from what you might expect, but overall i have a blast playing it."

												I played this gam through every stage of testing that I was invited to and was publically avaliable. This game si the reason I got a new graphics card for my computer. Here are a list of reason I like this game and would recommend this game:

1)Far Cry-esque way you can complete missions and take down camps and bases. (sneaking around, gathering intel/scouting, sniping, etc.)
2)Graphics: Seriosuly, I have caught myself looking around at points and marveling at how the game looks. The weather system is awesome
3)Gameplay: Enemies are not bullet sponges like they are/were in the Division. You can kill someone w/ 1 headshot ro two body shots, no more dumping a magazine or two dozen into a boss or enemy to kill them or take out there armor. (Exception being vehicles, but certain skills can counter that.) There are also enemy enviromental facors to consider, such as jamers for the drone, SAM systems, and alarms.
4)Skills/Gear: You can build and make your skills to suit your needs or play style. The only gear farming you do in this is huntign aroudn for the intel caches that can give you the locatiosn for the weaposn and such for each province. No more hoping/hunting for that last gear piece ala the Division."

												Ran around Bolivia shooting dogs and yelling at people to get on the ground and announcing myself to civilians minding their own business. Also breached the wrong house a few times and shot the dog. Later we surrounded this compound for a couple of days, It was a fun camp out and then we accidentally shot the dog and might have burnt the building down, Also ran into it with a tank. Sorry about that tank thing, hes new. We later went on to hand out guns to the local cartel members so we could track them but we forgot how to track them so we decided to pull out and pretend nothing happened. 10/10 would shoot dog again"

												This is written by someone who wants to play the game realistically and stealthily on the highest difficulty.

Pros:
lots of guns
lots of attachments
huge (pretty detailed) map
good customization all around
decent graphics
good mission diversity
military jokes

Depends:
The driving (IMO) is not all that bad, but the helicopter flying is terrible.

Cons (here we go):
loading times are >5 minutes even with an ssd
sometimes skill points or intel is hidden somewhere and you spend 5+ minutes looking for it
the bullet drop is wierd and it doesnt help that there is no zeroing for scopes
the game is secretly still in beta stage, they only fixed a couple things from beta and the big glitches are still there
on multiplayer there is a 50% chance your friend's silencer will glitch out and be loud, but it only affects players
nightvision and binoculars stop working after playing for a few hours
some enemies take over 5 shots to kill
this one piece of dialog keeps repeating for me every time i complete a mission and i have heard it at least 30 times now
the camo textures are a bit pixelated
smalll things like railings cant be shot through, meaning sniper towers are sometimes tricky to clear
the patrolling helicopters fly at 100 feet and fly over every few minutes, which can fail your mission and/or get you spotted.

Now, for the next issue. This issue is so big that it needs its own catagory.

The AI

First of all, the ai's equipment is not very fit for a fun experience. The reason why is because the majority of the ai has duel wielded smgs held sideways that fire at 900 rpm. Keep in mind that these ai can hit you at almost any distance, much like ArmA. The next issue is: the ai feel the need to sprint at full speed when they come into any contact whatsoever. For example, you miss your shot on the sniper tower and within 10 seconds there are 4 guys running at you  with huge LMGs and heavy armor, all shooting from the hip with pinpoint accuracy. The sprinting combined with little-to-none footstep sounds makes ai completely unpredictable and impossible to keep track of.

Conclusion:
The unfinished game would be pretty good if enjoyed on normal difficulty, where the game is like an action movie and your character is a bullet sponge. All because of the terrible ai design."

            In all seriousness this game isn't a clone of The Division, and is also very fun. However, I can see where some complaints come as this game seems to be rushed. So yes it is a great game but unless you aren't a fan of this genre I would either wait for the game to become more complete and/or wait for a price drop.

												Okay well I have not played the initial game itself very much but still I have been following the Beta very closely and grinded countless hours on my console. 

This game for starters has stunning graphics! Amazing open world sceneries, dynamic weather adds to the charm of this game and the robust AI is not bad either compared to many other dumb AI's out there. Anyhow that being said in my opinion the game throw a lot at you in terms of how the in game customisation, and the overall menu and things work. It can be intimidating specially for those who do not like playing mmorpg games.

However, that is a small and perhaps a personal issue of mine, aside that the game does tend to crash on pc a lot more compared to my console. (Note: My setup is beast enough to run this game ultra smoothly). Also the game is not that bad when you play alone with your AI ghosts. In fact a lot of people have been saying to play this game coop which also is fun tbh, but my personal opinion is that the AI is far more smarter than player. Of course compared to a new player! But well with friends we all enjoyed this game massively and I would strongly suggest you to buy this game as it is an all round experience from amazing tactical gunplay, to having an understanding of your surroundings and to know what the objective is. Go in all guns blazing or be as stealthy as a ninja that is upto you. But it is most satisfying to complete a mission without letting any alarm go!

Anyways happy ghost hunting people! BUY THIS GAME!"

												In truth this is more of a ""two thumbs sideways and a noncommittal shrug,"" but that wasn't an option.  I wish there was more than just thumbs up or down, because there are certain people that will love this game.  If you were one of the band that enjoyed the Division, you'll probably be among those singing this game's praises.  However, most PC gamers will find this to be the epitome of mediocre.  In so many ways, this game feels like a Far Cry clone, with a few clever twists.  Just as often I was reminded of Mad Max - this game is prettier than Mad Max if just from the environment standpoint - the graphics are on par honestly - but the controls for Wildlands are worse on EVERY level.  The shooting is passable, but the 3rd person camera is mostly there to annoy.  Cars are passable, but the plane had NO RUDDER at the moment.  

And then there's the already infamous helicopter.  I LOVE helicopters in games - it was one of the things I MOST looked forward to in this game.  *sigh*  Liquor up a monkey and let it drive - it'll do just as well and give you more enjoyment in the process.  Seriously, if more than 5 minutes of effort was put into programming the helicopter, whoever designed the controls for that thing should be fired, have their high school diploma revoked, and possibly demoted back to kindergarten... it's just that sad.

This is not a terrible game, but it's very hard to justify the full-blown price for the mediocrity to be found within.  If you just can't get enough Far Cry and the Division, then maybe.  But if you're even the slightest burned out on those games, maybe take a pass until the Steam Summer Sale when this hopefully hits $20."

												Denis Villeneuve's masterpiece: SICARIO was the movie...
Ghost Recon Wildlands is the game.

Now Wildlands isn't a perfect game, just came out, still in need of patching, updating and fixes but...
It is, still, in my opinion, one hell of a solid good game to enjoy!

You're a Ghost, sent to dismantle one of the biggest cocaine cartel of Bolivia, run by: El Sueno and his legion of underbosses, smugglers, scientists, war caids, rich connected ♥♥♥♥ers and such, controlling the whole damn country, bribing the police, armed forces, media, all the way up to the governement.

The map is giganti-huge, and you'll have fun in it for months depending if you're playing solo or with up to 3 friends co-op style. I would highly recommend co-op, even if solo is still very nice, it's far from being as fun as playing with friends.

PROS:
-Amazing crazy ultra-realistic graphics!
-Very smooth gameplay, well optimized.
-Huge frekin' map of Bolivia states, regions and sub-regions.
-Gazilion customization options for weaps, gears, appearance, clothings and more!
-Basic story at 1st, transforming itself into a complex drug cartel drama! Loving it!
-Tons of gadgets, tools, high-tech stuff to use, as well as calling rebels to help in many different situations.
-Good skill lvling system, lvling up main skills, weaps, medal perks, squad skills, rebel skills etc etc.
-Zero linear missions, everything is 100% up to you the way you want to approach missions, intel, recon and such.
-100% open world.

CONS: 
-To be able to enjoy the new visuals and ultra-realistic graphics fully, you'll need quite a powerful rig.
-Vehicules are very fun to use, ground, helicopters, planes etc, but can be hard to maneuver at 1st.
-If you play solo, some side gathering missions can become a bit boring after like 30h of gameplay.
-No manual jumping system, so some of the area i wanted to jump to were not working well even if most of the time the auto-jump is working as intended, it could be better and optimized a bit more.

In the end, i still really enjoy GR Wildlands every day, playing with friends or by myself.
No matter if you go all out crazy style, or role-playing military recon to the max, you'll have a very good time.

												Downvotes for Ubisoft games are usually very common, mainly because the company itself is pure cancer and treats their customers like ♥♥♥♥. With Ghost Recon Wildlands they offer about everything I hate about modern video gaming: Pre-order DLC, ""Deluxe Edition"" with additional cosmetic items, Season-Pass and Microtransactions that would even be too much in a f2p title. So I'm missing out on tons of stuff by ""just"" spending 60€ (and not preordering).
So if you ask me, Ubisoft deserves all the disrespect there is and even more.

BUT: Would I still recommend Ghost Recon Wildlands? Yes, definitely! All the hate for Ubisoft and their shady business practises can't change that this is a very enjoyable game, set in a beautiful world with an intense atmosphere. The story is interesting so far and the storytelling through a lot of different types of sources makes it even more enjoyable (Videotapes, Phonecalls, Audiotapes, interrogations and other cutscenes etc.).

Just don't buy the crap they offer. Don't get cosmetics, additional weapons, XP Boosts, don't pre-order and let the season pass go ♥♥♥♥ himself! This is the only way things will ever change back to the good, where we receive 100% of the product for 100% of an AAA titles price."

												This game is the best game this far into year 2017. Just what I were hoping for and even abit better!

But first lets talk about what most people expect when given a Tom Clancy and more presice Ghost Recon Game. The Tom Clancy name when attached to games began way back in the days with Rainbow Six Series. It started out with a briliant FPS tactical shooter. And held iself true to it's form for quite awhile. The same can be said about the more open leveled and military focused Ghost Recon games, Though they survived the first evolution into modern days. With a more future soldier(near future that is) focus. The Rainbow six series went from a highly tactical series, into a more action oriented experience. And lately the Ghost Recon Series have passed into the open world genere....

The thing is that this has not been a great secret, and the Open Beta gave anyone the opportunity to look at the different aspects of the game. So noone should be suprised here....


For me this game can be summed up like this: It's not deep, but i'ts a hell of a fun game.  To quote Hot Shots 2.. War It's fantastic! IN other words this is a game that makes you feel like a-team or some other epic action movie`series dudes.

Yes the game have some funny physics regarding cars, the steering of helicopters, boats and car/bikes feels abit not true. But Then again this is not a Military/rally/life sim. It's an open world game where the main focus is fights!

So what about fights you say? Well, if you do everything well, every engagement is easy, but one slipup and you feel it. This is especially noticable in Coop, as in singleplayer you will always be revived(once pr battle) by NPC teamates.

The game has some briliant solutions, the syncronized shot ability is awsome in singleplayer, and in coop you use it to mark  primary targets(atleast my regular playergroup does so). And it works fine. 

Weapons, yes you must locate end pick new weapons(and weapon attachments) up at differnet locations, but you uncover these places by sheer luck or finding intel. ANd the weapon customizer is awsome!

Story: Well Ecil drug dudes, pressure Bolivia to ignore them, and weeho enter America(!) special forces.. Time to make a cleanup on line 9.....

Works well as a background thing for your wild moviestyle action! 


Graphics, stunningly beautiful landscape, Now I wish to travel to south america again. Nice weather effects, and sun+mountains+ some fog and clouds are just worth screenshots!


All in all 8.5 out of 10. Game is a good Far Cry meets Just Cause kinda game, but carves it's own slice of the Openworld cake!
(better vehicle handling would put it up to a 9 out of 10)"

												My personal cons with the game are the vehicle & air mechanics. You can't elevate and go forward at the same time when you're in a helicopter, very frustrating. You seem to also plummit to the ground just by tapping CRTL. 

Vehicle mechanics are really odd too, It feels as though you're on ice when it's raining or on dirt/mud. The vehicles feel light, they seemed to have rushed the Vehicles in this game, which is a shame when you have such a diverse and creative game with so much to offer the player.  

Gun play in my eyes seems just like Far Cry, they're a bit too similar. They should of taken the The Last Of Us route and made the engine a bit slower for nice comfortable stealthy operations. But the game has it's pros; Crazy customisations from gun attachments, to gun skins. There is a deep deep storyline with so much for the player to do which is great with a small party of friends. Visually this game is stunning, so many different climates to explore.

I just wished they would of spent more time on Vehicle mechanics. I hope they have a future update that changes some aspect of the vehicles, especially Helicopters & Cars/SUVs.

- For a good group of friends i would strongly recommend this game!"

												Feels much like a cross between GTA and Far Cry with a military special ops theme. So far I've only had the chance to play single player and its been a ton of fun. The stealth operates quite well and there are plenty of ways to approach each firefight. The game incentivises clean and quick engagements by making large firefights difficult to survive, which considering the circumstances (4 friendlies and many bad guys) is pretty realistic. The skill point system gives a progression to the game that is welcome.

My only complaints so far are team AI and driving. The team AI is good if you command them well. For example the sync shot system works very well and allows you to take out 2+ enemies at the same time. But in open firefights there can be situations where one of your guys is parked in front of an enemy and is getting lit up without returning fire. Team AI can be remedied by coop with friends which I haven't had the chance to partake in yet. The driving is a bit clunky at times but is managable after getting used to it.

This game is definitely worth the price of admission."

												I just sunk 50 hours of my life into this game, I still haven't completed it - I still feel like I could play this another 1000 hours and not get bored.

Pros:
Graphics are magnificent, by far the best I've seen.
Customization options are vast.
Co-op & playing with AI give the game two different feels, both satisfying.
Gameplay and personal play style come together in an amazing way,
PvP is supposably happening - 4v4.
Replayability is absolutely endless.

Cons:
Controlling your character can feel clunky at times, both in 3rd person & vehicles - especially helo's.
Skill tree feels a bit lackluster.
Wearing stealthy camoflauge has no impact in game.
Fast travel needs some fixes.
Some missions are bugged & won't allow you to complete them.

Overall, this is the first game in quite some time that gives me an overall satisfaction, one that I cherrish. For me, it mixes a lot of games that I've absolutely loved together into one - I mean don't get me wrong - there's a LOT more I wish I could see this game have, but I'm not holding my breath because Ubisoft hasn't been kind to folks modding their games.

I just wanna throw it out there, it would be absolutely amazing if this game got modded for a Jurrassic Park type game. I would love to fight Unidad and a T-Rex. I'm just saying. Either way, this is a great game and I highly recommend it."

												So far I love this game.  Go stealth or guns blazing.  I kinda suck at stealth so I usually end up gunnin and running, but the job gets done regardless.  I'm getting the hang of helicopters, but shooting accurately with them is difficult.  The game does get repetitive.  The trick is to approach the missions differently or try to change the way you do a mission.  Get creative and mix it up.  There's alot of different ways to do things.  

Your AI teamates can be useful most of the time, but I usually take out the hard targets first (snipers, turrets gunners, etc) before sending them in guns blazing.  Haven't tried co-op yet, but I will cause I heard it's much better.  This is the kind of game perfect for co-op.

The missions where you hijack a convoy can be a pain, but mostly cause my AI teammates shoot up the truck or vehicle you are supposed to steal and blow it up many times.

This game is a ton of fun and deffinitely worth the $60 I paid.  I'll probably get the season pass when it goes on sale.

The only issue I have currently with this game is the bottons and joysticks are sometimes unresponsive.  Im using an xbox one controller."

Looks great, minor fps issues still linger but pretty fantastically optimized.


I can't tell ya much about the kids difficulties but throwing this ♥♥♥♥ on the hardest makes things pretty intense like realism mode tends to do in Tom Clancy games.


Play with your friends, that was one of the main selling points of the game. Games are boring if you make them boring, stop expecting Call of Duty to come out for the first time again its a military shooter for christ's sake."

												This is written by someone who wants to play the game realistically and stealthily on the highest difficulty.

Pros:
lots of guns
lots of attachments
huge (pretty detailed) map
good customization all around
decent graphics
good mission diversity
military jokes

Depends:
The driving (IMO) is not all that bad, but the helicopter flying is terrible.

Cons (here we go):
loading times are >5 minutes even with an ssd
sometimes skill points or intel is hidden somewhere and you spend 5+ minutes looking for it
the bullet drop is wierd and it doesnt help that there is no zeroing for scopes
the game is secretly still in beta stage, they only fixed a couple things from beta and the big glitches are still there
on multiplayer there is a 50% chance your friend's silencer will glitch out and be loud, but it only affects players
nightvision and binoculars stop working after playing for a few hours
some enemies take over 5 shots to kill
this one piece of dialog keeps repeating for me every time i complete a mission and i have heard it at least 30 times now
the camo textures are a bit pixelated
smalll things like railings cant be shot through, meaning sniper towers are sometimes tricky to clear
the patrolling helicopters fly at 100 feet and fly over every few minutes, which can fail your mission and/or get you spotted.

Now, for the next issue. This issue is so big that it needs its own catagory.

The AI

First of all, the ai's equipment is not very fit for a fun experience. The reason why is because the majority of the ai has duel wielded smgs held sideways that fire at 900 rpm. Keep in mind that these ai can hit you at almost any distance, much like ArmA. The next issue is: the ai feel the need to sprint at full speed when they come into any contact whatsoever. For example, you miss your shot on the sniper tower and within 10 seconds there are 4 guys running at you  with huge LMGs and heavy armor, all shooting from the hip with pinpoint accuracy. The sprinting combined with little-to-none footstep sounds makes ai completely unpredictable and impossible to keep track of.

Conclusion:
The unfinished game would be pretty good if enjoyed on normal difficulty, where the game is like an action movie and your character is a bullet sponge. All because of the terrible ai design."

Only problem is that in the beginning when you were creating you character it took a long time to load everytime you tried looking at a new face (for me idk if anyone else had that problem).

												This game has been a pleasant suprise. Honestly, I was very skeptical about how it would turn out at first. 

Pros:

+ Huge, open map with varied environments
+ Lots of customization, including various clothing options and the ability to customize your weapons
+ Great co-op experience
+ Graphics are really good
+ The game, in my experience, seems to be well optimized. I'm playing with all settings on Very High (with Turf Effects on, God Rays enhanced, and Long Range shadows on Ultra) at 1080p and get between 60-90 FPS consantly [specs below]
+ Support for both PS4 and Xbox controllers. May not be a huge deal for everyone, but I do enjoy playing some PC games with my PS4 controller from time to time. The fact that this game fully supports that is a big plus for me. Especially since I don't own an Xbox controller, so having Xbox prompts show up can be a bit confusing when using a PS4 controller.

If I had to choose some things to complain about, here they are:

- Driving can be wonky. Like...really wonky. There are a variety of vehicles to drive, but none are particularly fun to drive.

- The friendly AI is a bit weird. While this is a co-op focused game, if you choose to play solo you will do so with 3 AI companions. However, you'll constantly see them doing things that might break your immersion. I, on more than one occassion, have seen my AI companions run in front of enemies for no reason. On top of that, while I haven't confirmed this, they seem to be completely invicible. I've literally seen them getting shot up by enemies with heavy weapons and not flinch. This is weird because everyone, including the player, goes down fairly quickly. Overall, though. It's not a huge deal. They do some weird things here and there, but they seem to be competent AI for the most part. 

+/- Microtransactions are present. Now, this isn't a killer for me personally, but I do know this annoys a lot of others. From what I've seen, they seem to only be cosmetic and early unlocks for weapons/attachments. All that said, this is strictly co-op and, even with your starting weapons, you can easily kill enemies with 1 shot so it's far from ""pay-to-win"" as some are claiming.

In the end, I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who is into open worlds, co-op games, and shooters. I feel like it's a good sign for the direction Ubisoft is headed after having issues in the past and I'm excited to see what comes in the future. 

Now, I have not completed the game. So I will update this review if my experience changes.

												Great game that did not disappoint me. I have fun playing it solo and of course coop. Whereby coop is the best way to play it.

It has a huge map with hundreds of tasks and missions. Fully customizable caracter, guns and a lot of perks and even more guns.

The map is vast with different natural environement. Most of the houses can be entered. 

AI is okay, enemies are no bullet sponge. One shot. One kill. Stealth is key in later missions.

I like that you can change from 3rd to first person when you aim. Good controls with mouse.

Cars, helicopters, boats, tanks, planes a lot to play with with good controls if you know how. Even with mouse and keyboard this works fine for me. If you have problems with it, just exercice a bit more.

BUT, still some bugs. Even if the performance is good on my rig (check my specs in my profile if you are interested), the game itself has some graphic bugs, has control bugs, etc. But I am sure that this will be fixed as this has always been the case with Ubisoft and its AAA games. Sometimes you can not overcome an obstacle, you press space, but nothing changes...

I recommend the game even for full price. I am sure it will receive plenty of more free updates and modes coming in the future. It is a game that Ubisoft will support quite a while since the fanbase is already there and only growing.

Haters gonna hate... as always, downvote my review. I don't care.

Open world well made. Sand-box as it should be. Great visuals! No reason not to join this fun."

												Ghost Recon has been a long time favorite of mine since the beginning.  The complexity and the care and attention was what made the game amazing.  This, not so much as the orginal, but new concept and still incredible.  It is a different gaming experience, but when the difficulty is cranked up, that old feeling of holy ♥♥♥♥♥ comes back quick.

I have not had the chance to delve days and days yet, but after running the first few objectives I can honestly say when the kids are in bed, the head phones go on, and I travel to Bolivia with friends, and we make a mess.

I have also read a lot about performance, i did have some issues at first in Ultra, so I knocked it done to Very High and went custom everything back up to full except Texture, and shut down Vert Sync and restarted the game and it really is nice.  Maybe some drivers in the next little while for those suffering, time will tell."

												finally, a game where the singleplayer isn't a 2 hour afterthought tacked onto a generic arena based shooter.  the map is huge, the enemies numerous, the gadgets allow you to plan attacks in advance and the vehicles are superb at running people over(really satisfying).  although there is dlc and microtransactions they are nowhere near as prevailant as a lot of modern titles have been and the don't overbalance the game... they just speed it up a bit, which is what microtransactions should be in my opinion.  where as a lot of titles have been buggy at launch(anyone up for playing some watchdogs... AC:unity... arkham knight.) i have experienced no problems with this game and considering some of the stunning visuals in this game that is amazing.   i've waited years for another ghost recon and i'm so glad to see it wasn't a waste of time and money unlike a few other modern games i've purchased this is definately not going to warrant a refund request."

												like other reviewers have stated, a new release should not really be weighed exclusively on its performance issues at launch, so my reccomendation comes based on the following.


1. game looks nice, and the world is very big, If you are one of the people that is satisfied with the game play, you are going to get a LOT for your initial investment.
2. a lot of immersion, customizations, skills and stuff to keep you pushing to stregthen your character. TONS of weapons and upgrades, (although im pretty sure you could pass any mission with the start up kit).
3. switching between solo and co-op play is easy, and both sides are equally fun to me. its a pretty good challenge to put the game on max difficulty and try to solo the story missions. its also pretty rad to get into a group and just wreck havoc on everything.


I have seen people crying about the driving, but its no where near as bad as watch dogs 2 or any of the mafia games. it may not quite have the physics dialed in like GTA5, but it works. plus some vehicles have guns, and I actually like the helicopters...

when approaching an outpost , you need to be careful which side you come in from. If there are cliffs ringing the area, you almost always have to approach from another angle , because the climbing is pretty much useless other than small hops and low ledge pull ups. This is one of my only complaints. I'm pretty sure these elite spec op dudes could find more routes up these rocky areas, at least establish some ropes or climbing anchors like other games, so you don't spend 10 minutes skirting a hilltop outpost looking for a way in. 

Ive seen this game compared to the division, and i can draw the same comparisons only asthetically. In the division, the enemies are damage sponges, where a well placed headshot only pulls the NPC. In this game , your aim actually matters, and headshots on normal enemies are one shot kills.

the tactical and stealth mechanics are pretty light, dont expect AI on the level of Dishonored2, but that said, on the max difficulty the bots are pretty nasty. they notice fallen commrades and go on hunt mode, and their aim is ....well ...bot like. this can make for either frustrating or rewarding gameplay, depending on your personal level of patience and willingness to watch and plan. in the end if the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, you can go loud, and even be revived once pre battle by your team mates, if it goes really sideways.


the voice acting is pretty meh, but ive seen a lot worse in AAA titles.

in this day and age , gamers are ever critical of new games, so make sure you are reading into reviews for the things that are important to you, rather than just going by the ratio of good to bad reviews. very few games hit the mark on every box, but this game hits enough of them for me to enjoy it and give it the thumbs up."

I can't tell ya much about the kids difficulties but throwing this ♥♥♥♥ on the hardest makes things pretty intense like realism mode tends to do in Tom Clancy games.


Play with your friends, that was one of the main selling points of the game. Games are boring if you make them boring, stop expecting Call of Duty to come out for the first time again its a military shooter for christ's sake."

												This game is really amazing. It lets you customize your character in many different ways, right when you spawn in it gets you into the action.

-Something I dont like is the driving it feels like your stuck to the ground.
 
But in all other words the game is great, you should definitley check this game out"

												Played the game three seperate times before release and i saw lots of progression with fixing bugs and optimization.
If i ever had any complaints about the gameplay, It's Unidad, They are just a faction that either offer a challenge or just chew through your team.

As far as the game runs, I witness microstutters but they don't last long.
Game locks up for half a second every now and then.
Game still needs some more love.

Also on a side note, Even though i made a promise to a friend to wait for him before doing the story,
I still feel overwhelmed by how massive the map is and how much of the map is alive at any given time"

												Arma meets the Division.

ok, so people seem to be somehow offended by Wildlands being compared to Arma rather than MGS V. So, I'll break it down for the people that don't quite understand the comparison. 

First The Division: The entire game is built around the concept of gun and armor sets that are increasingly more powerful with level and rarity, in addition to providing the player with bonuses, all to use against increasingly more powerful enemies. This is a mechanic and system that you don't see anywhere in Wildlands. However, as far as the controls, teamplay, and general feel of both games, they do FEEL similar (Gee, can't imagine why). Two games FEELING similar does not make them alike anymore than Mario and Megaman could be compared because they were sidescrollers with similar controls. Aside from the feel of the games and what was already listed, The Division and Wildlands don't have much in common. 

Arma: Arma is an open map with bullet physics, air/land/sea vehicles, and teamplay that allows for multiple approaches to attacking various groups of enemies, facilities, and towns. Do I REALLY have to point out the similarities between the mechanics of Arma and the Mechanics of Wildlands here?

So, take the mechanics of Arma and mesh it with the feel and style of The Division, you definately have something much like Wildlands. 

MGS V: I see where people are getting the comparison to MGS V. However, MGS V doesn't have air or sea vehicles (that you pilor freely). The map is restricting in the sense that, while it is open, every road leads to Rome. What I mean by that is the map is more like a grid of roads that all go to the same places. You can't climb to the tops of mountains if you wanted because most of the mountains are used as the games walls and bounderies. You have to call in a helicopter flown by an NPC to get any kind of airtime and it's low flying and not a significant part of the game mechanics like it is in Wildlands. In MGS V you CAN be far more creative with the way you approach things. From using a box to hide, to moving bodies and throwing them in dumpsters, to using a F'ing cybernetic rocket fist etc. It has a level goofy in the gameplay you won't find in Wildlands. So, while there are similarities between MGS V and Wildlands, they aren't any more alike than any other open world sandbox military shooter.

Hense the review. Arma has Wildands mechanics and The Division has Wildlands feel. Wildlands = Arma meets The Division."

												(I will update this review as I continue playing the game.)

From the few hours (not including my Open Beta experience) I have been able to play the game in my busy college life, I've actually enjoyed the exploration around the countryside and taking in the scenery, enjoying the gunfights, hiding from the cops, and getting myself killed in stupid ways. This game wakes up the numerous nostalgic feelings I had when I played Borderlands with friends and had our hilarious banter in that game. In fact, I've been waiting for this game for months and glad it's out.

I would recommend this game and let me explain in a few points. (Both positive and negative.)

Pay-to-Play System:
Let's be real. A lot of people complains about companies doing this type of paywall on Day 1, but this type of behavior has been allowed for years by other game companies and has been encouraged for years. Many of the options I've noticed were the majority skins for the character, vehicles, weapons and other parts. Not bad at all and I'm perfectly fine with this. Hell, I'm perfectly fine with the EXP boosts in the game, especially since this is a RPG skill leveling system like The Division.

Yet, the part that does tick me off (and what I could agree with others on) about is the option allowing people to skip searching for the add-ons for weapons and some entire weapons. Instead of typically letting players find these add-ons, they allow people pay for a bypass around a hour or two of side content and give them an advantage early on. Luckily, the game hasn't implemented a PvP system, but again--this type of system is quite unfair.


Performance Hits:
Unlike The Division with how clunky it was released, Wildlands has shown to run smooth on my computer. I would get an occasion tear here and there while exploring and vertical syncing seemed to fix this issue, but the biggest issue I had with Wildlands (not entirely sure if it has been removed in the released version, since I haven't experienced it yet) is the CPU leaking / hogging the game would produce. (For reference, I have a i5-4790k and GTX 1070 w/ 8 GB VRAM and 16 GB of RAM.) Let me explain my particular case in detail for you:

In the Open Beta, my CPU locked up to 100% randomly (it normally runs 70~80%) and it was throttling my computer's performance to the point that I had to crash the game in Task Manager to have my Discord run normally again. I thought my CPU was starting to die, but after doing a brief Google Search--I found that the problem wasn't exclusively to me. Other people were having similar issues and it took a few threads on Ubisoft to find a work around.

Overall, I would suggest having a decent computer over the recommended settings before running this game. Sure, it might be a bit of a strain on the GPU, but this game does like to eat the living hell out of your CPU, no matter what you set the graphics settings to.


Vehicles / Roads / Off Roads
Honestly, people need to take it easier on Ubisoft with going more realistic on the vehicles. Sure, they might be too slick or hard to turn on some vehicles, but they're perfectly fine in my personal opinion. This isn't some ""Need for Speed"" game where you can go 100+ mph and think I can make a 25 degree turn easily with the handbreak. 

Let's keep it simple here. The rugged terrain in this game can do major damage to the vehicles and since they're fragile (even the helicopters), I would recommend taking the vehicles designed for the specific terrains, unless you're extremely cautious in these zones. If you're going to be offroad, then get offroad vehicles. Sport cars and large, transporting vehicles need to stay on the roads. Some missions may require you to go offroad or over bodies of water to get to the destination in the limited time frame, so don't get too attached to your expensive, shiny car. 


Story:
This will be updated later on, since I had a friend who was impatient during the Open Beta period and wouldn't let me watch any of the cutscenes. I apologize for not going into death for this section.


Enemy AI System:
If you think you can run into an enemy camp with guns blazing and being out in the open, then you better hope you have an aimbot prepared. Otherwise, you're going down in a hurry. You can get away with this in small group waves of the cartel on the side of the road or rushing the last person, but not in any specific case. The game is designed for stealth, especailly in higher difficulities, so think of using either sniping techniques or going into the base stealth-like. 

The enemy cartel and the police have the same system with minor differences. They both require detection, either by a dead body or standing near them for too long, to engage you and they'll call for reinforcements. They have different variences in their type of enemies, which will show as you go into higher tier zones. Both can be lost if you move away from their detection range The difference between the two is the police won't stop their engaging simply by elimination of their squad, until you eliminate them all stealthly and/or hide stealthly, and base their aggression off of a mark system, which increases as you kill more officers. Higher marks result in higher aggression tactics and longer wait times to lose the police, especially if you hit four marks and get a map-wide search deployed on you.


Multiplayer:
This game is dependent on the Peer-To-Peer system. So, if you don't have a sustainable or stable upload and download speed, then I would recommend another friend or someone else to be the host of your lobby. The game does depend on latency for hit registry, so if you're having high latency, then I would either avoid playing the game with friends during that time or adapt around the latency.

The gameplay is actually fun and highly recommended with others, especially when you have numerous other friends join in on the fun. However, do remember that you and your friends will need to work as a team to complete things. I had things completely go wrong because a friend would blindly run in, thinking he could kill someone else, and not realizing two other enemies are sitting in the opposite end of the room, which would alert everyone in the camp about our prescence. Of course, frustrating if you're tryharding, but this would end up being banter for anyone just wanting to have fun, despite hindering progress. So, this can be a good or a bad thing, depending on your friends and your playstyle.

Content:
During the open beta, I managed to squeeze about twenty four hours of gameplay from two or three zones in Wildlands., especially since I only explored for a small amount of time. There are way more zones in this game than just the three I played in the Open Beta phase, Each zone might be short with the amount of missions you're required to do, but there are tons of side missions that help give skill resources. You can also explore around the map for hidden skill points, side missions, bonus medals (which boost certain skills), and other hidden content. 

If you're going for the story alone, then it'll be short. If you're going for 100% completion, it'll be a while."

												Played the beta, and now on the release date the final version. It is an awesome game with lots of content, amazing graphics and somewhat interesting story. But, I have some thoughts about playing it as a tactical shooter, which is my favorite play-style.

I am playing it on the hardest difficulty level, but it is still way too easy. The main reason is your gadgets and teammates are extremely overpowered even from the very beginning. I can use the same tacticts over and over, which is, deploy drone, tag all enemies, mark them for sync shot and let the AI-controlled team members kill them off three at a time.

There are three main problems making this strategy too easy. One is, you have an infinite number of drones. Sure, the range and battery time is somewhat limited, but once it has used its battery you can just spawn a new one in your hand after a short cooldown time. This combined with your AI-controlled teammates ability to sync shoot the enemy flawlessly no matter if they have a clear shot or not, even through a solid mountain, makes you feel you are playing with some kind of cheat code. 

Another issue is the bodies of fallen enemies disappear after a short time, so you can just drop them all over the place with your drone initialized sync shots, and when a patrol comes there they will know nothing. In the end, you just need some patience and you're done.

So, if the enemy is within the range of your drone, they are basically all dead and you can kill them all safely far away behind cover. Your AI teammates will do all the work from impossible angles or distances.

I hope Ubisoft will adress this imbalance. For example by forcing you to pick up your drone if it runs out of battery or at least limit the number of drones you can deploy, have the bodies of enemies stick around until you cleared the area completely and make sure your AI-teammates cannot make impossible shots.

I also found cars are extremely overpowered in the game. You can basically use them as tanks, and just drive around in an enemy territory and have your team kill everyone while you are protected from enemy fire. Since vehicles can drive anywhere due to some car physics engine more geared to ensuring players can never get stuck than realism, there is no limits to how you can deploy this tactics. No need for a road, even GTA feels more realistic after a while. Helicopters also handle in a weird way, in many ways the game smells a bit like rushed.

In general, Ubisoft takes a lot of shortcuts to solve obvious problems. Letting the AI-team sync-shoot through mountains is probably easier to handle for the developers, and also if you leave teammates behind they suddenly just pop back right next to you. Cars handle in a weird way, to make sure you can never get stuck in the landscape, and the list goes on. Many details like these add up until you feel the realism just fades away. So, do not expect a military simulation in any way, even though the game has some serious look to it. 

In the end I will give the thumbs up though, as it is a fun game after all. And, you can still challenge yourself by not using the drone for example. The graphics is also a huge plus. The vast landscape is a joy for the eye, and it is so nice to just roam around to take it all in. Some nice touches like your AI-teammates telling jokes, and the radio programs add a lot to the charm. Hope to see some adjustments to the game after the release though.

EDIT: As someone pointed out in the review comments, you can disable the HUD for a more tactical game experience. This really transformed the game completely, and it is now exactly what I am looking for. With the highest difficulty setting and without the unrealistic hand-holding HUD showing you where all enemies are at any time, it is one of the most spectacular tactical games on the market today! Highly recommended!"

												Look, It is mostly PVE, but here are my pros and cons

Pros: 
Graphics are actually decent
The AI Teammates in solo are useful
If you play with friends, or randoms it will be a great time (Seriously)
The campaign is something to stick to

Cons:
The shot register can be an issue, even when you try to go the long shot (500+ Meters)
and thats about it I can think of...."

												First of all this is not a bad game. But for a 60€ AAA game it had far too many shortcomings.

Cons:
Writing: Every dialogue and every cutscene is either a parade of clichés or nonsense. Which made the ""story"" unsatisfying and at points laughable.
Voiceacting: Flat and monotone. Could have been done by random people simply reading from a page.
Glitches and bugs: There are alot and not all of them are small. For instance i have tried: 
1) No weapon will fire 
2) Can not use drone (this is important if you want/need to play stealthily) 
3) Rebel vehicle spawns on top of you and instantly kills you
And many other bugs.
AI) The AI of both the teammates (when playing solo) and enemies is quite bad, and at some points it ruins the experience.
Uplay: This is not entirely related to the game. But i dislike Uplay to put it mildly, and the microtransactions that go with it simply annoy me.

Pros:
Graphics: It looks amazing, even if my 980ti cannot pull off the full ultra setting. I should note that when i am driving fast the game is pulling data from the harddrive at 120 Mb/s (max for my harddrive) and my harddrive cannot keep up i think, so eventually the game freezes untill it has loaded the scenery. Quite annoying, but does not seem to happen as often when flying.
Stealth element: The feeling of satisfaction from completing a mission without ever being seen is really good.
Customization options: There are alot of options to customize both your own character and the weapons you choose to use.

In conclusion i would say this game lacks a few elements and a lot of polish and i would say a fair price for this game would have been 35-40€. As a last little example of this (NO spoilers): After completing the very last mission i spawn back into the world surrounded by 8 enemies who then proceed to murder me. Turning this moment of satisfaction into a joke."

												This game is basically the child of Arma and Division with excellent graphics and open world.
Graphically its very much stable on my GTX 1050ti with very high settings.
Apart from customizing your character ,you can customize your guns to your heart content.
The best part is ,you can explore and collect new guns,new gun-parts,intel files etc giving you a purpose to explore a lot in this game.
Also the backstories are excellent,giving you the purpose to eliminate all the 'BAD' guys.

My second fav Ubisoft game in recent years after Watch Dogs 2

A tactical masterpiece, if Extreme mode is enabled. 

But, too many locked items and side missions to unlock things dilute the overarching narrative. Launch bugs, as expected.

no bugs (guess we are lucky)

The scenery and the feeling of this game gives me and my friends endless hours of fun.. sure when we get trough the campain we will never play it again.. but if a game can get us all locked at our pc's with fun for 3-7 days.. TOTALLY WORTH!..

-Prepare to die if you think you can rambo past 2nd tier difficulty. 
-Video clips are great, as well as the actual story (probably top 3 stand alone stories for ubisoft imo)
-Driving in the actual bolivian mountain ranges is probably easier.

games beatiful i run it at around 50-80 fps on ultra setting long shadows and enchanced god rays and nvida turf and hbao on loading screens are kinda long but i end up with a smooth running game and now missing textures. weapon custimization is pretty cool and im glad you cant just use everything right off the bat and have to work for it but.....it is anyoing at times since i need to go through a whole military base just to get a scope for my assualt rifle but its all part of the kit. overall rating 8.5/10"

												9 out of 10.

These are my own opinions about this game.

So this game takes place in a South America country Bolivia.
Our main mission here is to take down the feared drug cartel named Santa Blanca.
There isnt much of a story but the way you progress in the takedown of cartel is good enough.
Santa Blanca Cartel's leader is called El Sueno.There are 4 branches you have to take down to reach El Sueno and they are Influence,Trafficking,Security and Production.You have the choice to directly go to El Sueno and kill him after you terminate 2 of his branches.For the gameplay all I can say is it could have been better but still it is pretty good after all.There are some inaccuracies with the physics engines but they aren't that much of a problem.I mean which game doesn't have bugs right?

For the graphics you can check out my screenshots and then I will let you decide if it is good or not. 
(Ubisoft made a masterpiece with the graphics,believe me)

For the screenshots,
  http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxrajer/screenshots/?appid=460930&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall

There are loads of guns which you will probably won't use most of them
My favorites are M4A1 and SR-25 and Five-Seven.
I have to thank Ubisoft for adding so many customizations for our like.
Also like Far Cry,you can call rebels for help in combat or vehicle drop but ofc you have to do some side missions for that as usual.
You can ran into enemy convoys with supplies randomly(You can earn rewards for marking the supplies)which is pretty cool.
Well you cant just wait for a convoy to find you,you have to find documents or interrogate specific enemies.
There are medallions located randomly in Bolivia and they give you extra skills(just a little improvement not op).
The way skills work is just fine for a game like this.
Do some side missions earn some skill points that you can spend in different skills.
There are 4 types of skill points which are;
-Medication
-Gasoline
-Food Parcels
-Comms Tool
When you upgrade a skill it will require one of these skill points randomly so you cant just grind for one of them.

There are various vehicles but most of the time you will be using a motorcycle or a helicopter and sometimes a car with minigun when you are with your friends but dont worry,as i said vehicles are various.

For the overall 

Is the game good enough?
-Yes it is great 
Does it deserve 60 euros?
-Maybe"

- 3rd Person mechanics similiar to The divison
- And a litte insanity like Just cause
- Driving is ok, from my POV there is lil room to improve
- Flying the chopper is a lil strange, but you get use to it fast and then it's somooth and easy.

Recommendation:
- Put difficulty to hardest or 2nd hardest stage and remove some of the HUD elements
- Play with friends in COOP"

												It reminds me a lot of MGSV without the goofy gadgets and story but with added multiplayer. The world is really big the environments are varied and I personally believe the AI are about what you'd expect from this type of game and I dont really see any reason to complain about them. The only downsides about this game are the driving (It's horrible) some pretty frequent crashes and issues with having an ""outdated game"" and the fact that you have to use uplay."

												this game has high (exclusively high) graphics requirements, but its so much fun im playing through the lag as best i can.

this game said fun and it delivered. the only thing im worried about is the fact that i mysteriously went from 08 to 30 in a second for no reason at all (i cannot figure it out why all i was doin was flyin from itacua to montuyoc and stopped at a rebel op and shot everybody even the guy by mistake then while i was attaching a new attachment i noticed level thirty and 64 new skill points), i may have a 5% infinite XP booster but that wouldn't have done that. 

i very highly recommend this game (even if you might not be able to run it on low) as this game just made the rest of my year)

(Edit 2:22 AM 2/8/2017)

Finally ad a chance to fly over the land, really mind blowing how much detail they put into this. Smoothest part of the game for me so far. at this point i still haven't really seen ♥♥♥♥ and i gotta say its impressively made (i'd play it just to see what the place looks like again).  how ever flying controls are highly counter intuitive and landing helicopters with a keyboard basically (when not used to it at all) is like an 80/20 raffle where 80 is for crashing and 20 is for rough landing. how ever if you get the hang of the down key you can land it like a dainty little butterfly."

+ The game, in my experience, seems to be well optimized. I'm playing with all settings on Very High (with Turf Effects on, God Rays enhanced, and Long Range shadows on Ultra) at 1080p and get between 60-90 FPS consantly [specs below]
+ Support for both PS4 and Xbox controllers. May not be a huge deal for everyone, but I do enjoy playing some PC games with my PS4 controller from time to time. The fact that this game fully supports that is a big plus for me. Especially since I don't own an Xbox controller, so having Xbox prompts show up can be a bit confusing when using a PS4 controller.

If I had to choose some things to complain about, here they are:

- Driving can be wonky. Like...really wonky. There are a variety of vehicles to drive, but none are particularly fun to drive.

- The friendly AI is a bit weird. While this is a co-op focused game, if you choose to play solo you will do so with 3 AI companions. However, you'll constantly see them doing things that might break your immersion. I, on more than one occassion, have seen my AI companions run in front of enemies for no reason. On top of that, while I haven't confirmed this, they seem to be completely invicible. I've literally seen them getting shot up by enemies with heavy weapons and not flinch. This is weird because everyone, including the player, goes down fairly quickly. Overall, though. It's not a huge deal. They do some weird things here and there, but they seem to be competent AI for the most part. 

+/- Microtransactions are present. Now, this isn't a killer for me personally, but I do know this annoys a lot of others. From what I've seen, they seem to only be cosmetic and early unlocks for weapons/attachments. All that said, this is strictly co-op and, even with your starting weapons, you can easily kill enemies with 1 shot so it's far from ""pay-to-win"" as some are claiming.

In the end, I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who is into open worlds, co-op games, and shooters. I feel like it's a good sign for the direction Ubisoft is headed after having issues in the past and I'm excited to see what comes in the future. 

Now, I have not completed the game. So I will update this review if my experience changes.

												Ghost Recon Wildlands is a very entertaining open world game with lots of large beautiful environments to explore.

----- Great gameplay, the gun handling and shooting are very solid and feel real good. Your character seems to run, move, duck etc. all with no problem. There is no jump or cover system in this game however it doesn't seem to be an issue as the character model will hug the wall when crouched and leaning against it and the ""vault"" option allows you to jump over/climb objects in front of you.

The Driving isn't a big issue as many have claimed. It's certainly different than similar open world games, however once you learn how to drive/fly it’s very easy. I actually prefer Ghost Recon Wildlands vehicle mechanics over most other games.


----- The graphics of this game are defiantly above average however the environments are top notch and very beautiful. I was also impressed at the level of detail to the weapons and how the weather looked in this game. The rain pouring down and how your character looks soaked or while you’re out in the snow and the snow is accumulating on your characters hat. All of those minor details make a huge difference.

*** Bonus to graphics - I also really enjoyed the graphic settings option in this game. When changing a setting in graphics menu the game has a very cool image displayed on the right showing you exactly what the function you’re adjusting will change in game. Example: Switching texture quality from Low to Medium, High or Ultra really does show the graphical progression. The game will show you exactly on every setting what it does and how it will look after adjusted. I wish more games would do this as good as Ghost Recon Wildlands does.


----- The missions are all very unique and can pose a true challenge when played at higher difficulty. Everyone plays differently and this game successfully allows users to go in guns blazing or quietly take out the objective. Each zone is comprised of 5-6 missions and seem to have their own little story. This allows users to drop in and out of friend’s games and play together while not disrupting their own story progression. You can simply just start a new zone together and continue to progress together.
Some of the missions can be a little weak or easy no matter the difficulty. Example: some missions are simply just go and locate someone to talk to them. However, they do not repeat, the game really doesn’t have any repetitive mission format at all. I personally took notes of the very fun missions while playing in order to replay them later on.


----- Character progression was done well in this game. Without a “leveling up to become more powerful system”. Ghost Recon Wildlands allows users to simply just find items to unlock while playing and leveling. More weapons and levels do not make players of higher levels 'stronger' it just means they have found different weapons or unlocked gadgets and such like night vision. 

The plus side to all these new weapons and attachments is that they all seem to be pretty balanced. I'm able to run through every mission using the assault rifle you’re giving at the start of the game and it wasn't any additional challenge. I also really enjoyed how the game never was a grind of gear. A large portion of the gear can be discovered and collected while you play through the story. 

Character progression does stop at level 30 as right now it’s the level cap. I’m not sure why they capped the leveling but at 30 I did feel less incentivized to do as much as I was before since I was no longer getting XP. Even if they didn’t supply a skill point for leveling up or give you anything. Allowing players to keep leveling up would be a fine incentive to continually play and level.


----- The story line of Ghost Recon Wildlands isn’t anything too special or unique. I mean, you’re just another “Super Duper Ultra Top Secret Elite Task Force sent in to do whatever is needed by the U.S. Govt.” I’m pretty sure we’ve all played many games like this and it’s a core theme ripped from a plethora of movies. However, it does have its moments where it shines, the ending was done very well as it does set up the DLCs and explain some cool story line stuff. For those seeking a huge rich/deep story, there isn’t much that Ghost Recon Wildlands is going to supply but if you can watch an average cheap action movie and enjoy it than Ghost Recon Wildlands will be an entertaining storyline. It’s worth paying attention to, however missing a cut scene here or there isn’t the end of the world.


----- The endgame and replayability is very similar to any other campaign based game. You get to replay the story and try different techniques to complete the missions. At the moment there isn’t a horde mode or anything like that, however there seems to be a lot of open world type things to do after you’ve completed the game. Like any other open world game, you can run around and collect all the lootables, complete the never ending side missions, try to stop random convoys that are around the map, steal supplies and return them to the rebels or simply just run around doing, whatever you want.


----- Overall it deserves the $60 and worth playing. I’d most defiantly recommend the game as it’s proving to be a positive release for Ubisoft. The game has a lot to do with a huge open world that is incredibly drawn up. Each zone looks so amazing and I have found myself just exploring random caves, mountains, forests only to find some very amazing things. The story alone is around 40-50 hours of gameplay if done at an average speed. I’m sure it can be done quicker but I do enjoy the story of a good game so I ended up playing pretty slow, but took the time to play very efficient. 

-----Here are some quick tips that helped me through the game;
Since weapons/attachments/Kingslayer files/Intel are practically on the path of the story missions. I’d recommend simply just playing the story mode and not worrying about collecting everything. I played by selecting a zone and focusing on the story missions in order then going to the next zone and running those story missions over and over. This kept the game interesting as the story missions do not repeat. After you’ve completed the story go back if you want to pick up the collectables you’ve missed. Since doing the story will allow you to pick up most of the collectables, doing it the other way around would make you back track and run in circles. - After I had killed the final boss I had realized I picked up more than half the collectables on the map.[/]

Skill points and medals seem to be the biggest lootables that are not on the path of the story; those are worth going a little out of your way to collect

Do NOT rush the end boss. I don't care how fast you complete the game, however it's worth it to go after El Sueno only after you have 100% all the other story missions. You don't need to have all the lootables collected but make sure each zones story is completed. (I won’t ruin/spoil anything however, it’s much better when you kill El Sueno if you have 100% the zones than if you hadn’t)

Play on elite difficulty. The game can be pretty easy playing on lower difficulty, especially after you've been playing on elite for a while. At first it may be too hard on elite, force yourself to adapt and you will end up enjoying the game more.

Take notes on your favorite missions in order to remember which ones to replay after you complete the game."

												This game is a really fun game with friends. From taking out the enemy together to dirt biking down mountains there's many cool things to do, but with friends. Also I highly recommend playing with game if you have a video card with 4GB of VRAM. Currently I have 2GB and it looks like I'm playing a game made from play-dough. 

Overall good game

												A decent tactical shooter as long as your able to play with friends, can't imagine suffering through a uninteresting story with three AIs constantly getting on your nerves. The game offered around 50 hours of content with two players on the harder difficulty. Playing the game with a controller was great. I'd recommend the game if you enjoy a co-op shooter with your friends every now and then, but paying 50 euroes for the current content is hardly worth it.

The game has as previous reviews suggest some minor bugs, especially regarding phsyics but it does not by any means ruin the experience. The biggest dissapointment is the fact they released a game without it's key features (such as multiplayer) and instead opted to add DLCs straight away. I did not even realize I got a DLC for pre-purchasing, while my friend who did not didn't get it, we were of course disappointed we couldn't play the additional areas together. I feel sick when I check the store, as Ubisoft continues to try to collect every single cent from microtransactions such as xp boosts and other wierd stuff.  I have a very hard time seening anyone actually needing this (except being tricked into buying them) as the level cap is 30 and easily reached before the end of the story missions. Lastly, if someone mentioned end game and Wildlands in the same sentence it probably was a joke.

TL;DR 50 HOUR OF TACTICAL SHOOTER CONTENT WITH FRIENDS"

												I've played about 5 hours of Wildlands, so that pretty much makes me an expert at this point.

How it feels: The Division

How it looks: Just Cause 3

How it plays: The Division + Metal Gear Solid 5: TPP

This game does all of these things well, but none of them really great. It's a game that has a lot to it, but there doesn't feel like there is a clear direction or incentive to doing them. The base weapon and clothing you get looks cool enough and perform well enough that there isn't a clear need toupgrade them, and the customization is pretty lackluster in that you can upgrade your character for a better drone/more ammo/damage reductiion/etc, but at the end of the day it doesn't feel like you really need to do so.

tl;dr It's a good game, albeit a little copy pasted, with no clear incentive to play the game other than for your own enjoyment.

I give it a 7/10 Ghost Racoons"

												Played this game for 6hours today and i can only say that this game is amazing! This game have huge Map and amazing graphics and stealth gameplay. You can unlock new guns and attachments and different explosives. Ubisoft should fix some little bugs but today was release day so its normal that game have some bugs after release. I think that driving is horrible but luckily you can use helicopter or plane! Poor performance is again problem like in Watch Dogs 2 because i get only 60-80 FPS on 1080p with i7-6700k and GTX 1070. Ill give 9/10 to this game."

												This game is the best game this far into year 2017. Just what I were hoping for and even abit better!

But first lets talk about what most people expect when given a Tom Clancy and more presice Ghost Recon Game. The Tom Clancy name when attached to games began way back in the days with Rainbow Six Series. It started out with a briliant FPS tactical shooter. And held iself true to it's form for quite awhile. The same can be said about the more open leveled and military focused Ghost Recon games, Though they survived the first evolution into modern days. With a more future soldier(near future that is) focus. The Rainbow six series went from a highly tactical series, into a more action oriented experience. And lately the Ghost Recon Series have passed into the open world genere....

The thing is that this has not been a great secret, and the Open Beta gave anyone the opportunity to look at the different aspects of the game. So noone should be suprised here....


For me this game can be summed up like this: It's not deep, but i'ts a hell of a fun game.  To quote Hot Shots 2.. War It's fantastic! IN other words this is a game that makes you feel like a-team or some other epic action movie`series dudes.

Yes the game have some funny physics regarding cars, the steering of helicopters, boats and car/bikes feels abit not true. But Then again this is not a Military/rally/life sim. It's an open world game where the main focus is fights!

So what about fights you say? Well, if you do everything well, every engagement is easy, but one slipup and you feel it. This is especially noticable in Coop, as in singleplayer you will always be revived(once pr battle) by NPC teamates.

The game has some briliant solutions, the syncronized shot ability is awsome in singleplayer, and in coop you use it to mark  primary targets(atleast my regular playergroup does so). And it works fine. 

Weapons, yes you must locate end pick new weapons(and weapon attachments) up at differnet locations, but you uncover these places by sheer luck or finding intel. ANd the weapon customizer is awsome!

Story: Well Ecil drug dudes, pressure Bolivia to ignore them, and weeho enter America(!) special forces.. Time to make a cleanup on line 9.....

Works well as a background thing for your wild moviestyle action! 


Graphics, stunningly beautiful landscape, Now I wish to travel to south america again. Nice weather effects, and sun+mountains+ some fog and clouds are just worth screenshots!


All in all 8.5 out of 10. Game is a good Far Cry meets Just Cause kinda game, but carves it's own slice of the Openworld cake!
(better vehicle handling would put it up to a 9 out of 10)"

												Pretty surprised how smooth the launch when, haven't had any major issues other than one crash caused by Nvidia. I had a lot of doubts about the game but I'm loving every bit of it.

The game itself is a blend between Just Cause 3, Far Cry 3/4 and a hint of GTA IV.

The customization is really really well done, hopefully they add more stuff in the future.

Overall I really feel like I got my 60 dollars worth of content out of the game so far and I've barely scrated the surface in regards to the open work and everything else.

Solid 8.5/10, only downsides I can think of are the confused friendly AI and the goofy driving/flying."

												GRW has a lot to criticize. Mostly it's repetitive gameplay, superfluous weapons, awful aircraft controls and confusing vehicle design. Beneath that though lies a solid, immensely enjoyable co-op game that gives you and your friends a run for your money and tactical skill in a huge, beautiful environment. 

There is so much I'd like to say and spoil, but if you liked the outpost sections from Far Cry and weapon customization this is the game for you. It's a tactical shooter that's unforgiving but also great fun. It takes time and skill to learn, but when you do it never ceases to surprise you or catch you off guard. 
While a lot of the weapons in the game seem to have little purpose except as filler (Why you would want to use a bolt-action sniper rifle that has worse damage, handling and penetration stats than a semi-automatic one, I don't know), but they handle well, offer a wide variety and land each kill with a very satisfying *THUNK* sound.

Get it with friends, play it for a weekend, and enjoy the hell out of parachuting from a kilometer up in the air only to miss the chute release and land balls-first on a wooden fence."

												Ya know I wasn't expecting such a good game and I'm not going to really make any bad claims because the game is Amazing! I mean you need the new Nvidia Drivers to run it stably but I mean it's worth getting the new drivers anyway.

So the run down I'll give pros and cons about this game and you can decide wither you want to get it or not.

Pros
It's a pretty big map and this game isn't something you spend 4 hours on like Watch Dogs 2 and For Honor but I guess I can't compare those games so forget I said anything.
So many different things you can do, though some times you find your self stuck because there isn't really anything to do but well do quests and side missions that give you the Resources to unlock new skills.
Tons of different weapons to use, and then you get parts you can customize it's just never ending to be fair.
The Character Customization isn't too bad, there's lots of different cloths you can use.
Probably what sold me was being able to become bushman.

So now it's time to go hard on this game I only listed a few of the ""Worthy"" Pros that really I thought could make it in and get someones attention really.

Cons
Ghillie suits don't work as a better stealth option sadly, Ubisoft fix this plz.
Skills require ""Resources"" which makes it kinda fun to get skills in the beginning but then it gets either annonying or you stack up just tons of ones you don't need and can't find the ones you need.
Guns are a little weird from how you would think they would work, but bullet drop is prefect TBH, if you want to know what I mean by ""weird"" I mean it feels like your playing airsoft in a game just the Airsoft guns make gun shot sounds.
Vehichle controllers are diffenetly not up to par with other games like it though you get used to it, ignore this if you use a controller it's better with one.
Takes a really long time to find where every Keybind is but I guess this is just me :P
Voice chat and Text chat are broken you're better off using a Voice communitcation program like discord.

That concludes my list guys! Hope this helps you decide if you want the game or not!"

Pros: 
Graphics are actually decent
The AI Teammates in solo are useful
If you play with friends, or randoms it will be a great time (Seriously)
The campaign is something to stick to

Cons:
The shot register can be an issue, even when you try to go the long shot (500+ Meters)

												Clocked up about 30 hours in this game already and ive got to give it to ubisoft, Even though i loathe said gaming company, They have stepped up their game from most of their previous projects, 

Pros -
- well presented world and diverse areas 
- Decent assortment of clothing and weapons
- Stunning visuals
- fairly stable FPS (for higher end systems)
- Combat is good
- Co-op is a great addition to the game

*But thats all its got going for it in my opinion sadly...

Cons -
- Buggy A.I at some stages 
- Story becomes gutless after the first few hours
- Driving physics needs work
- Voice overs are bad
- Side missions and collectibles get boring and repetitive
- Buchon mission become very repetitive 

The list does truley go on...
 
*VERDICT
- Would not buy it as of now, only if you are playing with a group of friends then it minimizes allot of cons. But i have not yet completed the game and i will be leaving this game for when i get some free time to just plod through it. But as of now, this game will be at the back of my steam library."

												I'll keep my review short - my impression so far is that Ubi finally produced a decent game, would definitly recommend. Balanced between tactical and arcade-ish gun play, wonky physics that sometimes remind of GTA, interesting story and progression game play so far. I think the gameplay will get repetetive kinda soon, but there is ton of content to explore and collect, or to drop in with friends. If you expect a hardcore tactical shooter, this game is not for you. If you want to enjoy a classic arcade-ish single player shooter, definitly go for this game."

			Review: Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Wildlands is an open world third person shooter playable in single player with AI companions, or in online co-op.		
	

TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!
Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands is an open world third person shooter playable in single player with AI companions, or in online co-op.

You and up to three other players or friendly AIs are free to explore the large open world of Bolivia. You play as a member of the ghost recon team sent into Bolivia by the CIA to find intel, locate cartel members, and dismantle the entire organization one section at a time. There are some interesting main story missions, but for the most part, the main plot and the characters are not all that memorable.

The core of the gameplay revolves around completing missions. Combat plays a huge role in the vast majority of these missions. The combat can be approached stealthily or you can just run in guns blazing and start blasting enemies to bits with various weapons or explosives.

If you want to ghost missions, synchronizing kills with your allies is an absolutely necessary, and effective tactic. Attempting to fully ghost the game with all HUD indicators turned off makes Wildlands feel like a completely different (and more challenging game). I hated being spammed with notifications and prompts all the time, so I’m very glad that there are HUD options available. I turned most indicators off, but I did keep some on to help keep tabs on enemy movement. Spotting enemies using a drone or binoculars is extremely helpful, and I used the drone quite often.

Leveling up your character requires you to kill enemies, complete main missions, side objectives, or find collectibles. In addition to earning skill points by leveling up or finding them in the world, you also need to collect resources that are earned from completing rebel side missions or gathering resource items to learn any new skills.

The online co-op is definitely more enjoyable than single player. Public matchmaking is available, but I prefer playing with friends and communicating over voice chat. Inviting friends to join you, or just dropping in to their games is easy, and the peer-to-peer connections work fine. It’s also nice that players can spawn on allies in co-op if their revive timer runs out instead of having to restart the mission like in single player.

Playing single player with the three friendly AIs isn’t too bad, but the AI could use some improvement. They weren’t really a burden, and they didn’t get me killed or anything. At times they felt completely useless though, and didn’t offer me much in the way of cover support. They also revive you with enemies standing right next to them. It was a bit annoying to be revived and instantly shot at again. The AI companions don’t stay with you very well, but at least they teleport to you anytime you get in a vehicle.

Pros:good variety of other missions types, including spy-like infiltration, car chases, killing, kidnapping, interrogating targets, hijacking vehicles, and defending objectives, etc.
easily accessible weapon loadout, and attachments the can accomadate different playstyles (i.e. grenades, and grenade launchers are great for on the move, or you can also take a more tactical approach by setting up traps using mines and C4, and creating noise distractions to lure enemies into them)
Bolivia is quite large, and there is a lot of content; there are tons of main story missions, sidequests, and collectibles
character progression occurs at a reasonable pace
character and weapon customization is excellent, and there are plenty of cosmetics to discover
environments look good; the provinces with different structures and ecozones are a nice change in scenery
music during the gameplay is decent, sound effects are great; the voice acting is mostly good, but occasionally there is too much talking
controls are fully customizable, and there is full controller support
Cons:some mission types can start feeling repetitive (i.e. collecting intel)
annoying music and announcers on the radio may make you wish there was a way to permanently disable radio option
(nitpick) the mountainous terrain often makes for lengthy driving route if you plan to stick to the roads; also, there’s too much travelling, and you can’t toggle vehicles into first person view (on a side note: I suck at driving, and prefer to drive as little as possible)
(nitpick) some texture popping, and some areas that look very bland and other areas that look like more of the same
(nitpick) performance isn’t perfect, and the game could use better optimization (using Win10, i7-6700k, GTX1070, 32GB RAM using custom settings somewhere between very high and ultra typically, maintained above 60fps, but periodically when driving there were noticeable, but brief hiccups in performance)
(nitpick) microtransactions are available to unlock cosmetics, or weapons and attachments immediately, or for purchasing xp boosts to level 50% quicker (you can find the weapons in game, and leveling faster without having enough resources from doing side objectives isn’t that helpful; these microtransactions are completely unnecessary, but their mere presence along with the season pass is bound to irritate some people)
I played entirely with the mouse and keyboard, but I would have really preferred a controller for driving and flying. The vehicle controls feel a bit wonky with the keyboard: sometimes it felt almost too sensitive, and different vehicles took a bit of getting used to. The plane and helicopter controls seem simplified compared to other games like GTA or BF. I find it easier to fly in Wildlands, but flying does feel kind of clunky.

After fully completing the main story missions for any 2 of the 4 cartel operations, you can finish the main story and see the ending. It took me roughly 17 hours to do so in single player, and that was with gathering any convenient collectibles, but skipping almost all of the side missions. There is still a ton of stuff to complete including half the story missions, just about all the side missions, and a whole lot of collectibles. Even though I saw the ending, I intend to continue playing more missions in co-op.

Conclusion:Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands has a whole lot of content to keep you busy. There is a good variety of mission types available, but even then, some of the missions and constant travelling may feel repetitive after a while. Overall though, it’s a decent game. The single player is fine, but playing online co-op is the best way to play it, since there’s even more fun to be had with friends.

												This is honestly fun coming from a guy who has never played any of the previous Ghost Recon games. Granted that this is one day after the release of the game, there are many occasions when the frame rate drops, but never below 30. This is at the medium preset with an Intel Core i7 6700, 16 GB of RAM, and my GTX 1060 3GB that I have overclocked. There are still some performance issues, but I would recommend because this is the experience I have never before seen and felt in any other games that I've played."

												Updates
I'll just mention a few things that bug me, I still recommend the game
-The sounds the motorcycles make when the shocks get used at all sound absolutely ridiculous
-The ai teammates are pretty dumb
-The physics are a bit odd in certain situations
-The civilians really don't care about cartel murdering everyone
-I've been ran over twice while scoping out bases from the road (civilians don't always stop)
-The radio is pretty dull
None of this is game breaking, its still really good, these are just a few issues that bug me while I play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just wanted to post a review for the people who were on the fence about buying this after playing the beta, it is worth it in my opinion. 

I played the beta, and honestly didn't think I was going to buy it. It looked like a game I've played a hundred times before, but I read a couple of other reviews after the beta and decided to take the risk and I honestly think it will be worth it. 7 hours in and I haven't gotten 100% completion of the first area.

A complaint I saw about the story (I believe from IGN) said that is was lacking, boring, and skippable... I disagree. This story isn't bad, its not game of thrones quality, but it is pretty good. 
My complaints are the helicopter controls are goofy, I don't think it is finished when it comes to optimization, and there are a few bugs... but its a new game, it can be patched. 

Aside from that, the game is everything you would expect it to be. If you like ghost recon and open world stuff, you'll enjoy this. GTA is a very similar feel, and I feel like GTA is a better game if you do not already have that.

Bottom line, if you were somewhat interested in the game, go ahead and pick it up."

												TLDR-8/10 Go get it.
Ghost Recon Willands is a amazing game that has a somewhat intresting plot,fun gameplay and a vast open world to explore. The game features a massive open world where you take down the santa blanca cartel in any way you want anywhere on the map. It allows great free flow as it makes you feel as the master of your own domain. Couple this with multiple collectiables such as weapons,attachments,mementos,audio files and more allows you to always be hunting for or finding somthing. Add fun gameplay with shooting and stealth with optional side missions (that get quite stale as they are all cookie cuttered) and you get a really great game. Overall i would give Wildlands a 8/10"

												Performance wise -
only one problem so far, you can't play it maxed out even on a card like GTX 1080, i am using GTX 1070 amp extreme, tweaked the settings from very high to ultra, getting decent fps from 60s to 70s and sometimes in 50s while driving. still 8 on 10  game looks damn beautiful and performing good with little tweaking  
Gampley wise - 
One word, AMAZING, well many don't like it but i am telling about my experience, just enjoying every single second of this game, stealth is good, map is brilliant, really beautiful, mission structure is really nice according to me, you are free to do whatever you want and do missions however you want, some people say its strictly stealth but that's not the case, you can play it loud as well. 9.5 out of 10 for gameplay 
Overall - 
just a beautiful game with breath taking scenes and some awesome action, open world fans and stealth fans just go for it. overall score from me is 9.8 on 10 (would have been full 10 on 10 if game was not problematic on maxed out) but still its a diamond !
EDIT- Performance issues gone with all those patches, at least for me."

												I honestly thought this game was going to be fun. I had put about 26 hours into the open beta and I loved it. I dont even play the game for more than 20 minutes now because the game just simply frustrates me. Theres a lot of things that have been said about this game that needs to be improved and some of those problems are what is keeping me from fully enjoying this game. I didnt want to believe it but this game really is repetitive. The game in general is very stale very bland. Theres no point in playing stealthy because no matter what, your always gonna leave a huge compound guns blazing. The npc's have the same dialogue as do the rebels and your AI teammates. Your gonna find yourself flying off dirt bikes and dying when your not even driving that fast, The enemys know your location instantly after you have been spotted almost as if every cartel member in the compound all share the same brain. The frame rate drops are unbelievable. One minute Ill be playing at high 60 fps low 70s then out of nowhere im at 40 fps with my gtx 1060 playing at high settings. At this point in the game im extremely tired of clearing out compunds. This game gets boring early on in the game. I really dont recommend spending 60 dollars on a game like this I dont think this game is even worth 40 dollars honestly."

												So far I vary much enjoy this game, I'm still waiting on a day 1 patch which will much improve the game and after its released thats when you should buy it. Currently there are texture glitches and the handling on the cars are pretty bad but they say they will get fixed with the patch. Even with these problems I say make the purchase. I've seen people talk about FPS drops and over all horrible proformance but i've been fine with a GTX 970 and I7-6700K with 16gb ddr4 ram. I'll come back to this and update it once i get an update.

Edit: So i got an update, this is a little late due to the fact that I forgot about my review. So the Texture glitches aren't seen as much as they were but they still do exsist, you'll find them from time to time like the ground will look like its on a low setting even though your on high. Handling still sucks but you can kinda get used to it (better with a controller.) This game requires a lot of stealth, in the trailer it says you can play how you want, yeah not so much, mainly stealth and killing 4 people at a time (you can unlock upt to 3 sync shots) waiting for the cool down and repeat though i still find to game enjoyable, trying not to get hunted is kinda fun. The Cartel ai is pretty weak though the Unidad ai can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ a lot as they'll just walk in, f you up. final opinion doesn't change, still worth the money."

												I hate buying from Ubisoft like most sensible people, but wow was I impressed.

TL;DR At bottom
The Pros: 
AI listens to you most of the time
Great stealth, very fun to plan strategies
Huge variety of guns, easily changeable for any occasion
Don't have to stealth if you get fed up
Shooting feels generally realistic
Great story and background info on enemies
Loved the case files/videos made it seem real
Story long compared to most games
Huge map tons to explore
Satisfying to 100% everything
Great soundtrack
Realistic gun damage
Able to solo everything
Some very helpful upgrades
Main characters are relentlessly American
Great/hilarious American stereotypes
Nice Character customization
Tons of hours to still be put in
Play style/completion is however you want it to be
Difficulty settings actually get more difficult 
Motivated to complete/take down the cartel
Mentions the Bilderberg group (Its brief but cool)
The Cons:
Enemies respawn at bases you have already wiped out/may have to redo
Helicopter have crazy sight/spotting capabilities (Seriously nerf these ♥♥♥♥ing things)
There were countless times where I was flawlessly stealthing a huge base (Santa Blanca base)
and a Unidad helicopter would fly over spot me and a ♥♥♥♥ing war would break out because AI would start shooting at helicopter, no matter where I was hiding they would always see me
Flashbangs/Drone Medic (and other Drone types)/A lot of upgrades felt very useless (Maybe it was my play-style)
Enemies in cars can see you like helicopters
Some unrealistic base areas | For example: Sub base in the middle of swamp/marsh wetland
TL;DR Overall really great game, just some mechanic issues that can easily be fixed. Especially since the game is very new.
EDIT: As for the performance/framerate/loading issues. I didn't experience any of that. Although I have a i7 4790k and a GTX 1080. Got over 100fps most times I was playing. So sorry to those who cant run, but it worked great for me.

Well done Ubisoft, you didn't completely ♥♥♥♥ing butcher it like most things you touch."

I have a solid framerate, in the 90+ range, but this is such a glaring issue that I cannot help but feel like it should have been caught in QA. And I didn't have this issue in any other build. I took part in a closed alpha, the closed beta, and the open beta and did not have this issue.

Gameplay is fun, gunplay feels solid, and what's more the open world aspect is very well realized, but I cannot recommend a game that can't properly render ground textures. Whether or not there is delay or it loads them in the fact remains that this crap is ridiculous.

And let's not talk about the insane amount of day one DLC.

But these things won't discourage the review brigade from marking every negative review they can find as not helpful. Shame we've reached this point."

												I wish this game had a neutral rating. It's not bad, but it's not all that great either. It feels like something is missing and it doesn't really draw me in to keep playing for more than an hour or two at a time. The places you attack all kind of start to feel the same after a while. I start playing for a bit and then kind of just get bored and go play something else. It feels like your not really getting anything done in game and the main quest doesn't do anything to make it feel important. 

I have spent most of my time playing just kind of running around attacking various places and doing a main mission once in a while. The gameplay itself is actually pretty fun and the game looks fantastic, but when you don't feel like your accomplishing anything it's really hard to play for long periods of time at once. The game also has a few stutters while playing, it's not too bad, but it's a bit annoying.

There are lots of weapons, mods and various gear / items you can equip. You can drive, boat, fly choppers / planes, skydive and parachute while jumping off a cliff. The world is pretty large and there are tons of things to do. There is a pretty good upgrade system that lets you focus on specific things like making your character stronger, upgrading the drone, upgrading your AI teammates and upgrading the rebels support. You can free locked up rebel fighters who will just randomly start attacking the enemy which is pretty neat and can help cause some distractions. 

I would purchase this if you are either a fan of the series or if you really like third person open world action / stealth games. It kind of reminds me a bit of Metal Gear Solid V mixed with GTA V plus your own squad with sync shot added. I would give it about a 7.5/10"

												After, about 40 hours of gameplay.  I have to say. i am not totally hooked. but i did enjoy it. minor some annoyances.

This game had the potential to be, the best game ever made. but then it fell short. 

here are the pros:

Incredibly amazing graphics that  Runs smootly, spanning over a huge map.
The combat and AI are Above what you would consider Average. 
The Story line and acting is somewhat captivating. 
Performance wise, this game is gold. with just a few bugs i encountered. (Called for SUV, landed on my head and killed me). but this only happened once. 

some of the silly things

Game has a little bit of the MAD max sandbox syndrome. A little, not entirely that much. 
See i enjoyed MAdMAx, but having or feeling like you have to do all those side repetetive grind tasks on the side can be dreary. and until now i still havent finished the game. In Ghost i feel like it might end up the same way.
As i said, the story line it self is brilliant. but since the game needs you to do all the side tasks to improve your self. well.

prepare to do 24 times each of the following.
Steal helicopter, steal plane, steal truck, Attack sattelite relay, press E on two Towers 1km apart in 1min time.
Tag a supply drop, and deffend a radio relay, and i think scare soem guy to death by shouting crpa in his ears.....etc? maybe i missed one or two.

See after doing this maybe 7 times now, i really dont wanna do it again, and yet i have to. anyways. I just wish Sandbox games would do less with this repetetive nonesense. I dont mind that i have seen some bases more than once. (copy and paste) I dont mind as there are lots of variety still. and you do feel like you are really in an entire country. I trully enjoyed flying or boating down river. its trully a visual experience on a 34 in screen at least.

in a nutsehll, i really feel like they missed out on an opportunity to make something truly epic. with all the rooms they had to play with. they could have shown GTA V how you can do it better. but then again. GTA spent 300m$.

MUTIPLAYER CO-OP.

Unless its your friends on MIC COMS. just dont bother. 3  AI are more fun, have better things to say. and can be assinged to SYNC shoot. so you can kill 4 ore more in one hit. really. dont bother palying with randoms. just takes longer and it spoils the sequencin of your campign map. 

anyways, i hope you enjoy the game."

												Pleasantly surprised! I was expecting a huge mess, but being Ghost Recon I still had to pick this up. Low and behold it runs great! My wife and I are having fun, but I can see where it can get repetitive to some people. Maybe its because my expectations where so low for another Ubisoft game,  but I dont think this is the case. This game hits the mark when playing coop, strategizing a bit, or just going all out Rambo style if you please.... and if you are having fun, what more can you ask for? As I said before I can see where some people would think this would get repetitive, or that this shouldnt be called ghost recon, but I think we have just gotten so used to hating Ubisoft that they hardly give it a fair chance. If you have a friend or 2, definitely pick this up and have a go."

												Pretty surprised how smooth the launch when, haven't had any major issues other than one crash caused by Nvidia. I had a lot of doubts about the game but I'm loving every bit of it.

The game itself is a blend between Just Cause 3, Far Cry 3/4 and a hint of GTA IV.

The customization is really really well done, hopefully they add more stuff in the future.

Overall I really feel like I got my 60 dollars worth of content out of the game so far and I've barely scrated the surface in regards to the open work and everything else.

Solid 8.5/10, only downsides I can think of are the confused friendly AI and the goofy driving/flying."

												Clocked up about 30 hours in this game already and ive got to give it to ubisoft, Even though i loathe said gaming company, They have stepped up their game from most of their previous projects, 

Pros -
- well presented world and diverse areas 
- Decent assortment of clothing and weapons
- Stunning visuals
- fairly stable FPS (for higher end systems)
- Combat is good
- Co-op is a great addition to the game

*But thats all its got going for it in my opinion sadly...

Cons -
- Buggy A.I at some stages 
- Story becomes gutless after the first few hours
- Driving physics needs work
- Voice overs are bad
- Side missions and collectibles get boring and repetitive
- Buchon mission become very repetitive 

The list does truley go on...
 
*VERDICT
- Would not buy it as of now, only if you are playing with a group of friends then it minimizes allot of cons. But i have not yet completed the game and i will be leaving this game for when i get some free time to just plod through it. But as of now, this game will be at the back of my steam library."

												TL;DRProbably the best tactical coop shooter currently available. Console port; great graphics options but easy, even on Extreme despite decent shooter underpinnings; turning off minimap and avoiding regular intel caches helps. A lot of fun with friends, easy drop-in/drop-out, tolerates shenanigans/alcohol well. Lovely flourishes like flora mechanics and dirt/mud.

edit: Later missions are more challenging, esp ones with differing objectives like grabbing targets alive or defend for a period of time. Rebel missions are all the same, story missions have decent variety.

The Division? Really?The Division is an mmo looter, this is not; anyone who says otherwise is nuts. True, character customization/weapons loadouts are similar but gun upgrades/pickups are completely static; that's ok because this isn't meant to be a looter! You'll figure out some weapons you like or need if you're specializing and use them most of the time because the focus is on being a shooter. Which is also why, unlike Division, there are no bullet sponges (ok maybe choppers and such but it makes sense that an armored vehicle would take longer to bring down, a good marksmen can take out the passengers). Note that this is in Extreme, I do NOT recommend playing it any other way.

GraphicsAre good, lots of options for pcs, decent view distance but sometimes wonky LOD. Performance has improved since beta. Lots of cool touches; grass compresses and moves, sugar cane gets pushed out of the way as you walk through it, vehicles take on dirt realistically. In an early plane stealing mission our group got some dirt on the wingtip when we dipped it into the runway slightly. Mud gets on vehicles in ways you expect. If your gamma is set correctly day and night differences are pretty good, night vision is necessary but worth turning off occasionally to see the sights.

AtmosphereMuch less empty than Mad Max and doesn't get increasingly empty as you go, plenty of NPCs moving around making it feel relatively lived in, enemies don't completely disappear (good or bad but at least early on retaking of compounds you wipe out make sense and Unidad should probably be relatively permanent), rebel activity increases as you help out. Maybe more empty compared to GTA, I'm also a guy who's used to driving around empty ArmA 3 maps.

MechanicsReasonably crunchy tactical shooter, in Extreme headshots are deadly (even body shots with high caliber), bullet penetration exists but feels wonky sometimes. LMG and high caliber snipers can pierce wooden fences and thin metal walls but canvas tents are disturbingly sturdy. Overall its much less crunchy than ArmA 3 but good enough. Primary focus of game is shooting things, kinda reminds me of simple fun killtower maps in Raven Shield but with more to do. There is bullet drop but no atmosphere, long range sniping is reasonably challenging but can get frusrating if LOD doesn't show you that there's an obstruction between you and your target. Overall, entertaining and reasonably rewarding; don't feel like NPCs cheat, good marksmanship and tactics pay off, just wish it wasn't quite so easy to rambo. Again, only play on Extreme!

With the variety of things to do and a lack of arbitrary enforcement of approaches it's possible to do some clever things, esp with a well coordinated squad. For example, parachuting is pretty fun, flight ceiling is reasonably high, AI are reasonably aware: HALO insertion with a decently coordinated squad can be very entertaining. Belaboring the point a bit here, while it's not a milsim like ArmA 3 there's enough there to make it fun. Pop too soon and you're a sitting duck likely to get gunned down, pop too late and you faceplant, land in the middle of the bad guys and they'll get riled up potentially calling reinforcements and really making things pear-shaped.

VehiclesAre ok. Cars aren't as bad to me as some others say, feels decent when climbing a hill in a heavy vehicle vs a bike with slide and so on. Bikes feel a bit too solid to me and the APC can get wonky. Helicopters and airplanes are... ok. Pretty sad there's no real yaw, helicopters aren't terribly realistic. Not a lot of potential for derring-do but they'll get you places and can serve as aerial shooting platforms. Drone is launchable from vehicles.

ChallengeBiggest con is that it is too easy. I'd be even happier with the light crunch of the tactical shooter side if I wasn't spoonfed literally everything all the time. Kinda typical open-world Ubi bs I suppose, maybe to cater to console. Mad Max was similar but I haven't played many others (used to avoid on principle); Mad Max was better if you avoided Stronghold upgrades so similarly here I recommend avoiding major intel caches. At least here you can turn UI elements off and I recommend turning off at least the minimap. Game improves significantly if you're having to actually recon and discover/explore things on your own. You can always turn it back on later if you need to scratch that completionist itch or if your coop partners aren't willing.

Overall there is a lot here that doesn't rely on lame openworld mechanics so even in the worst case it's enjoyable. Just wish it was better."

												A MASSIVE open-world game with unlimited ♥♥♥♥ to do. There is never a boring moment. The map is insanely detailed, and insanely huge. Sometimes I like to just stand on a mountain and admire the beauty of the world. The missions can get slightly repetitive, but I try to approach each mission in a different way. You can either rush into the base run n' gun style, or take a very slow and stealthy approch. I prefer the stealthy approach as it provides for many unique situations. The gunplay is incredibly satisfying, and I enjoy the amount of recoil.

The cons of this game were very obvious in my first hour, but after that I started to love it, and the cons began to fade away.

I highly reccommend this to anyone who enjoys stealthy, beautiful, and content-rich games (who doesn't?)."

												English:This game redefines the lower limit of optimization. You will encounter countless frozen moments, loading issues, bugs and glitches with different aspects such as drones, map pins, etc.

Gameplaywise, the story, at least to me, is minimal. Your squad is assigned to Bolivia to take out the Santa Blanca drug cartel piece by piece. Maybe it's because I haven't finished the entire storyline, but so far everything is just standard in terms of story. Nothing will blow your mind. And this game, just like all recent Ubisoft single player open world games, has the typical Ubisoft-type collection. Although they are optional, some of them are rather feeling ""mandatory"" as you need skill points and resources to upgrade you skills, which are rather helpful in terms of taking out enemies and taking over different locations. Graphically speaking, the game is beautiful, which in turn will require a higher-end PC if you want to fully experience the beauty of nature in Bolivia.

In terms of performance issues, like I said above, you will experience frozen moments, especially if you are in vehicles, which include land vehicles like cars, water vehicles like boats and air vehicles like choppers and planes. As annoying as it is, most of the time you just need to wait for 2-5 seconds before it turns back to normal, but this problem is rather critical in some missions with time limit. Just beware that in missions with time limit, if your game freezes in the middle, your position after the freezing will not change but the time passed during the freezing is deducted from the timer. In order to reduce the frequency of such freezing just lower your drawing distance in graphics setting. This will effectively reduce the frequency of freezing but will NOT remove it from the game. There is not much we can do.

The spotting system is also pretty inconsistent. Sometimes when you drive pass enemies you are just ""suspected"" which means you are fine as long as you keep driving away from them; sometimes when you drive pass enemies they will spot you immediately and start shooting at you. This will directly increase the difficulty especially when you are doing ""car-stealing"" missions or similar.

Am I recommending this game to others? It depends. If you can stand somewhat severe performance issues and like the world settings in this game as well as like collecting stuff, then yes, this is a game for you. However, if you are not really into the world settings or you can't stand bad performance at all, then don't pick this up because I don't think they will fix the performance issues soon as it's still rather severe after being released for more than 10 days.

Final Verdict: 6/10. Could play if you want, but you are not really missing anything if you don't.

简体中文：这个游戏重新定义了优化的下限。在游戏中你会遇到数不胜数的卡顿、加载问题以及其他各种各样的bug，买bug送游戏并非空穴来风。

关于游戏本身来讲，剧情对我来说几乎等于不存在。你的小队被派遣到玻利维亚去瓦解圣塔布兰卡贩毒集团就是整个游戏的主线。可能是因为我还没过完主线任务，但是目前来说整体剧情非常中规中矩，没有任何出彩的地方。而且这个游戏和育碧其它的开放世界单人游戏一样有经典的育碧式收集系统。虽然理论上来说这些收集内容都不是强制的，但是在游戏过程中它们会给你一种强制性的感觉，因为你需要收集技能点和资源来升级你的技能，这些技能又对击杀敌人和占领据点很有帮助，所以有时候还是不得不收集的。游戏的画面还算不错，但是相应的也需要较高端的PC才能完全欣赏玻利维亚的美景。

关于游戏的表现问题，最常见的就是我上面说过的游戏卡顿，尤其是当你驾驶载具的时候。这包括像汽车这类的陆地载具、船这类的水上载具以及直升机和飞机这类的空中载具。尽管这个问题很烦人但是大多数情况下你只需要等2-5秒游戏就会恢复正常。但是有时候这个问题还是很致命的，尤其是当你在做一些有时间限制的任务的时候。需要注意的是在做有时间限制的任务的时候如果你遭遇了卡顿，虽然卡顿结束后你的位置没变但是卡顿时消耗的时间会从总时间里面扣除。如果想要减少卡顿发生的频率的话就在画面设置里面降低绘图距离。这样可以减少卡顿发生的频率但是不会完全消除卡顿。

游戏中的警觉系统也给人一种很生硬的感觉。有时候你从敌人旁边开车经过的时候只会“被怀疑”，也就是说只要你开车离敌人远远的就没事；有时候你开车从敌人旁边经过的时候敌人立刻就发现你然后朝你射击。这种不连贯性会在你做偷车类任务的时候直接增加游戏难度。

我会不会向别人推荐这款游戏呢？因人而异。如果你可以忍受这种近乎严重的卡顿问题并且对游戏的故事背景很感兴趣而且热爱收集的话，这款游戏很适合你。但是，如果你对游戏背景设定不感冒或者完全无法忍受一丁点的卡顿的话，千万别买这游戏。我不认为在游戏发售超过10天之后整体表现并无好转的情况下育碧会在近期修复这些游戏表现问题。

最终评分：6/10。如果你愿意的话当然可以买来玩，但是就算你不玩的话也没有错过什么值得一玩的内容。"

												Instead of a really long boring paragraph, I'll just do a quick pro vs con list

Pros:
- Huuuuuuuge World
- Infinte ways to approach a scenario
- RPG like leveling and skills
- Plenty of guns and gear with lots of customization
- Tons of Main Missions
- Tons of Side Missions which adds to helping allies
- Grahpically Beautiful (Draw distnace is A1)
- Coop is tons of fun
- 30+ hours of gameplay
- Sound is great for this type of game
- Singleplayer is even fun (atleast for me)

Cons:
- AI is pretty wonky, will duck if shot at but thats about it
- Bit reptive over time (not too bad but some will mind)
- Few quirks and bugs (nothing game breaking)
- Uplay (not too bad since i run thro Steam, just adds bootup time)

Neutral (some will like, some won't, I just dont mind):
- Microtransactions (nothing pay to win thankfully)
- Season pass doesn't seem worth it
- Takes a long time to traverse the world at times"

												this is a fun game worth buying even at $50. Ubisoft didn't do too shabby. seems to incorporate a lot of ~tactical operator culture~, name dropping brands like 5.11 Tactical and Crye Precision (and don't forget the tactical beards).

pros: tacticool guns, really scratches that comfy co-op itch, offers a nice experience for both casual and more serious players

cons: extremely vulgar commentary from in game characters, doesn't have any truly interesting game mechanics (but it's a co-op game so whatever), features silly Tom Clancy ghostwriter writing (""narcostate"" lmao)

not a good game, but not a bad game at all. its a fun game. it's like MGSV with much less artistic flair, and with co-op. I don't regret the purchase"

												This game is awesome!

To be honest i find this game very fun playing with friends 
The tactical feel is awesome and fun. Playing solo is cancer because the bots sucks and is just in the way. Would had been awesome if there was a option to remove the bots

The optimizaion is a big improvment since the open beta

Positive:
-Fun playing with friends
-Nice combat mechanics
-The bullet drop is good
-The missions are fun but some time repeitive
-Taging stuff for XP
-Currently playing the story

Negative:
-Sometime i end up in host migration screen and it disconnect me everytime
-Driving and flying controls are a bit derpy
-All other players should get the taged stuff too if one player founds it
-Parachute mechaincs are weird too
-The vehicle physics are horrible
-Screen freeze sometime for the joining player (fixed for i5 users)

+ map (map size, details, several biomes)
+ in-depth customization of gear (be the ghost you want to be)
+ coop drop in/out seamlessly
+ random fun moments with friends
+ teamwork pays off
+ HUD can be toggled on/off and can be customized as well
+ gameplay feels ""right""
+ high immersion (without HUD)
+ character animations very smooth and realistic (climbing out of a car window if the door is stuck)

o missions (a few are interesting, some are dull, repetitive, however, they do the job)
o performance/ optimization could be better

- AI sometimes too good at aiming (dual-wielding MAC10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will kill you instantly over a range of 150m)
- lack of enemy variation
- singleplayer experience mediocre at best (better with friends)
- car/ helicopter/ plane physics rather bad (also cars are too similar to each other)


If you are looking for an open world title to play with a friend/ friends there is nothing you can do wrong with Ghost Recon Wildlands. In short, it is a solid game (singleplayer)/ a great game (multiplayer).

												Das Spiel ist wie ich es mir vorgestellt habe. Keine Probleme beim Dowmload, und beim Start.  Die Performance vom Spiel ist wie auch schon in der Beta, schwankend. Mal hat man gute FPS, doch bei viel bewegung und viel Kampf, eher nur um die 45-50 FPS.

Spiel sieht alles in allem aber Wundervoll aus und es fühlt sich -anders als bei anderen Spielen- Vollständig und fertig an. Das Waffenhandling ist 1A. Das einzige kleine Manko das ich habe, ist die Fahrzeugsteuerung. Für meinen Geschmak ein bisschen zu Empfindlich was das Fahren mit Bodenfahrzeugen angehtz. Beim Fliegen mit Luftzfahrzeugen geht es einigermaßen. Das ist aber Meckern auf hohen Nivaue. Die modifikation der Waffen und die charakter custimasation gefallen  mir richtig gut, da hier jeder etwas findet, was Ihm gefällt. Hier hat Ubisoft also mal richtig gute Arbeit geleistet. 

Ich hoffe aber noch das ein bis zwei patches veröffentlich werden die meine performance etwas in die höhe schrauben. 

Noch kurz zu meinem System. 
Ich spiele mit einer GTX 980 Ti OC Strix mit 6GB
einen i7 6700K mit 4GHz
und 32 GB RAM

DIeses Spiel ist für alle empfehlenswert die auf eine Große, wunderschön anzusehende offene Welt, mit viel Missions Content stehen, und die es lieben, alles zu looten was es so auf der großen Spielkarte zu holen gibt."

												 Its very hard to review this game. Its a Mix of GTA V, Far Cry Series, Just Cause 3 (minus the Grapple Hook) and yet you die with about 4-5 hits 

I pre ordered this game waaay back , then refunded it after playing Closed and Open Beta due to huge NAT issues and the linear structure of missions. Its just the same go here, Kill this, tag that, extract that, intercept this missions. However, the Co-op more than makes up for it. 

This game  shines when you play on Co-op. The fun of taking out targets and marking them is just gleefully fun. I had to re-buy this game after a few of my friends almost forced me to buy it only for the Co-Op.

The Post launch NAT issues seems to have been ironed out so far too, with no NAT issues so far.

 Major Gripe - Microtransactions 
Seriously Ubisoft??? Half the Cosmetic stuff locked away beyond credit packs? FFS!!! Stop this travesty already. 

 I am an Indian so if you think I am gonna buy the cosmetic stuff and not Grind them the hell out, you're wrong Ubisoft 

So far a mediocre-Good game with some really strong elements (Huge Map, Lots of unlockables, Co-Op) and some really weak ones (Driving, Flying)."

This is exactly what I wanted out of Division.
I was really disappointed with how the Division turned out and the direction they chose to take it.
Wildlands was definitely not a disappointment.
The Coop is amazing, the weapons are diverse and highly customizable. Character customization is engrossing, the graphics are destryoing my graphics card, the story and game setup are fresh and exciting; you play it as you want and free roam/play the game at your own pace.

GR Future Soldier was not a let down, but Wildlands certainly revived the Ghost Recon we all know and love.
With the direction of titles like Siege and Wildlands, there is an incredibly bright future for the Tom Clancy Franchise."

I'm very impressed cuz i thought i will never see any good tactical stealth games after MGS5(the true stealth games LEGEND's)  but i was wrong, Wildlands here

I recommend this super great game for who really like stealth tactical  games , and also for who like to play co-op it has best co-op too.

Important Note:
Just play it in the hardest level for best stealth experience

i'm really would like to give it 10/10 but the story not that much

												Definitely a big yes from me. In general the game looks amazing, feels amazing, is amazing and has tons of content in it. The mainstory alone has hours and hours of missions to do, the difficulties are perfectly set up in my personal opinion with the enemies offering a challenge even with the regular difficulty (Played regular on Open Beta and Advanced after launch)

Pro's and con's from me

Pro's :
+ Long mainstory
+ Cutscenes are extreamly well made, which definitely makes them interesting and worth watching
+ Graphics
+ Amazing background for the story
+ Missions offer a lot of variety and there is a lot of different ways to do them
+ Co-op campaign
+ Realistic bulletdrop
+ Skill tree has some extreamly useful skills

Cons :
- Driving glitching out like hell occasionally
- Crashing into a rock causes your characther to fly hundereds of meters in air
- Flying on helicopters
- Glitches with missions while playing co-op (Happens rarely, either one or more of the guys in the same game are able to only join the mission as assistance > completing the mission wont complete it for them)
- A number of stuck spots, mainly by cliff's and containors that are placed too close to a wall etc.


Overall the game is definitely worth the money, been playing co-op for 34hours (Only doing missions while in co-op with a friend) and we have 95 main missions completed which takes us to total of 89% of the main storyline done.

Personally my favorite thing in the game is definitely hitting them longshots, there is nothing better than hitting a clean shot to a moving target thats 600-700meters away from you (Now I know the drawdistance for enemies etc is 650meters but you can override this by having a friend thats closer to the enemies.)"

												First impressions:

So far so good. Here are some of (my personal) pros and cons:

Pros: 

- Squad AI is pretty good, the sequence shooting feels pretty stellar, and even though this is probably a design flaw, I like you can just walk through your squad.
- Helicopter controls are good. Easy to control and doesn't feel clunky (this goes for the normal driving too)
- You can opt in for guns blazing, or genuine stealth. It's not over if you blow your cover accidentally.
- Storyline is stellar (again, only four hours in)
- Open world, feels more like an RPG, there are multiple ways to progress and multiple requirements for those progressions
- There's a decent amount to do, one minute you can be driving to the story mission, then you'll find an enemy settlement where you can steal helicopters, intel etc for personal progression.
- Game on Ultra, along with the general scenary looks beautiful.
- Unidad officers make this game a ♥♥♥♥♥ at times. (Yes, I find this a pro, makes the game more difficult, and the cop system is more intellegent).
- Map is pretty massive. 

Cons: 

- Optimization is good, but there's a lot left to desire. Nvidia still haven't released drivers for this game as of yet.
- Gameplay, a lot of the story is grab intel, go in there kill a few guys. I can feel this overtime getting repetitive, however as of now I'm still enjoying it.
- There's no real penalty for dying.
- Could potentially cause an issue with people with a lower spec PC. I'm running a I7 6700K, 16GB DDR4 2666MHz, GTX 1060 rig. However CPU usage on the game alone is 30%ish, I'm currently using 60% RAM (however I do have chrome and multiple tabs) and I'm running it smoothly 60FPS on very high. Ultra is a no no. 

However, overall. This game is good."

												This is your definition of a solid 7.
There is nothing mind-blowing or innovative about Ghost Recon Wildlands, but it's a solid game that works and really scratches that open world shooter itch (at least for me)

The game is structured nearly identical to Metal Gear Solid V, so it comes with both that games pros and its cons.
 It's a huge beautiful open world filled with enemy outposts that you can approach tactically in a number of ways. Go in with a helicopter guns blazing or sit back and pick off targets with your drone and your synch shot.
There is plenty of customization and gear to unlock, which helps keep things interesting as new weapons and gadgets increase the variety iof ways n which you can take down foes. There are tons of side missions scattered around the huge open world to collect supplies which are vital to upgrading your skills and upgrades for your rebel support. 

However that is pretty much it and like MGS V while fun and tactical the game does get repetitive. Now I managed to get 40 hours out of it and thats not including the betas and frankly I could still go for more, but I can definitely see how it could get repetitive sooner for others, it will really depend on how much of an itch you have to play an open world tactical shooter.

Other things to note would be the incredibly mundane story and dialouge which is so platitudiness and vacuous it is almost a parody of itself.The driving in the game isnt great either, very arcadey. Also as a solo player I wish there was more control over your AI squadmates, but the synch shot is pretty satisfying.

All in all GR:Wildlands is a solid mechanically sound game set in a beautiful open world bogged down by a generic story and a structurally repetitive framework. I played solo but I am sure that playing co-op would add a whole new layer of depth and fun to the game

7/10"

												I enjoy this game and think it is a nice game, Now do I think it should be 60 dollars, no more like 40 dollars. But just wait for a small sale if you want this.

												Great Game. COOP is actually fun with randoms depedning on your personality. I join COOP to do whatever so I am not easily annoyed. Single player can get boring but sometimes some missions are easier without coop. Anyways kind of surprised. Its like far Cry, watch dogs, and a lot of other IP from UBisoft but it plays well, toms to do. Driving controls are ♥♥♥♥♥ like watch dogs. Surprised I had fun, more surprised then COOP is fun. I had it in my mind since I pre-orderd I would refund at 2 hours. Didnt need to. And the in game buying ♥♥♥♥ is pointless for me as I seem to find a lot of stuff just playing. O well. Nice game, minimal problems at launch. Worth playing. I need some UBI freinds to play coop with."

												I’m gonna through my hat in the ring and just say this. Were aware that this isn’t a “Typical stealth tactical game"" like that of Splinter Cell (which I played back in the days I wasn’t a PC Gamer) or Metal gear solid. But for some to say the game is bad on PC is an understatement. For start the graphics alone are enough to make one play the game, with a draw distance that holds detail at over 5km is a feat in technological achievement on its own. I mean the shots that me and my friends pull off in the beta were stunning. That isn’t saying that it’s impossible to not pull of the total stealth zones without being detected, it’s just seems like the game wants you to do the arcade/stealth aspect. I’m just going to say this, if you plan to go stealth, HAVE A PLAN AND GOOD RELIABLE FRIENDS. If not one slip up will cost you going stealth and then turning into a balls to the walls gun shoot out (god damn is unidad annoying when it gets to that point)

Now is this game for single player, no and I wouldn’t recommend it for just that (but I don’t mean that Single player is bad I’m just saying that’s not what the game was designed for), but with a group of friends the possibilities are endless. And I will say Ubisoft hit the nail on that alone. Sure by the reviews from the beta, tagging enemies with a drone makes it easier but this is the 21st century. We’re using drones to track people in Iraq and I don’t see an issue with a game that is actually up to date with drone’s usages so far (quad copters is what I’m referring to). Also I found it much easier to be stealthy and distract enemies much like that with the camera from Splinter Cell’s conviction.

Many other reviews from the beta section of the game were in response to camera issues and control issues. Camera issues and all the wonky controls are just something that is unique to each game. GTA had them, Red dead redemption had them, and nearly all games have some camera issues of some sort. My saying is either get used to them or deal with it, or if it’s that big of a deal then just stop playing the game and try to get a refund. I mean really control that you can even bind and setup custom controls to your keyboard are a thing these days. Take the time to set them up if it bothers you that bad. I tend to set the controls similar to that of Fallouts controls, but this is because I’m familiar with that games controls and I bet you can do the same for a game similar to your gaming preferences.

I will also say this, the game takes a demanding PC to run at high. Latency issues with players are an issue, but knowing from running gaming servers this takes time to weed out as some changes to game mechanics and even missions can cause uncontrollable lag. I don’t expect the launch to be 100% bug free but it’s not gonna be as bad as when GTA V Online released back in 2013. But if you want to run the game at high or ultra, then take in to consideration if your setup will handle to load. I know the minimum specs are for a system that is of late 2011, but that’s the minimum specs to just play the game and not give a damn about graphics. If you want to check my specs on my profile feel free to, but I ran this game on my main PC and was able to average 57 fps on high. Not bad at all, but maybe with a GTX 1070 and the new Ryzen AMD or Intel i7 series, I could pull that off with an Ultra graphics with possibly 60+ FPS.

That being said here’s what I think and what people should take into consideration. If you want a game that you and your friends could play in Open-world, Co-op missions and want stunning graphics that you’re capable of running on a great (and I mean like $800-$1000 machines here) machine, then get the game. If you’re not able to meet that then I can say you'll be disappointed like many of the reviewers giving the beta a bad review based upon 1.5 hours of gameplay and assumptions from previous games.

If I had to give it a score I’d give it an 8.5/10, and if Ubisoft continues support (much like it does for the division) then I’ll rate it a 9/10. Yes Ubisoft has made screw ups in the past, but with the release of wildlands I can only hope the company continues to make games as good, if not better than wildlands in the future. And if they can I can see the community possibly forgiving them for the day when Ubisoft made games that were buggy as hell.

Time in beta: 10.5 hrs
Time in GR:Wildlands: well have to wait and see after the first 30 hours"

												Please consider this game right now to be [Early Access]

Sandbox FPS with some tactical elements, throw in some GTA elements, ability to make a custom character + customize your loadouts - then add in some BF elements and just cause style chaos and you have Wildlands. There are some issues though such as air combat with Helicopters is bad, and the driving physics is sometimes wonky and occasionally you might run into some really funny glitches, but overall - it doesn't really make the game any less fun to play. 

The graphics are amazing, bolivia looks stunning. If your looking for a FPS game thats fun to play and you have time to burn, since it'll take along time to collect all the items and finish all the content then check out wildlands.

Stealth vs Loud; The former is one of the problems with the game as quite a few missions require perfect stealth to complete otherwise its instant fail and you have to restart; many of these are nearly impossible in public co-op for the obvious reasons, whilst failing or dying has little consquence it can become annoying having to keep backtracking in order to complete the missions and as for death, put it simply you'll die - a lot most of the time you'll suffer WTF deaths or unfair deaths due to narcos or unidad spawning from thin air.

The AI is horrible, your team mates are literally just tag alongs most of the time- in fact, if you had the option to go alone it probably would be better since they are that dumb. Enemy AI is broken as well, some enemies function with zero brain functions and will just allow you to kill them easily, others will know exactly where you are at all times - they'll shoot through walls, fire mortars - enemy helicopters will circle you constantly until you can kill them, and by the way? Totally forget about surviving against unidad apache gunships.

Pros

Awesome Graphics and Scenery
Plenty of collectables
Good co-op experience
Fun to play
Character and Weapon Customization

Cons

Bugs and glitches everywhere
Bad A.I
Bad co-op experiences
Bad Driving mechanics
Potentially P2W
Micro-transactions"

												A decent game, but very repetitive. Hopefully they add in more variety to missions and gameplay. I got this game because in the open beta I met awesome people. We had fun and agreed we'd all get it. I highly recommend doing coop and multiplayer, solo is fun but can get boring fast. Overall a good game but still has a sorta grindly feel. Also alot of glitches and bugs that they seemed not to fix from the betas. Overall a 7/10 ghosts."

												Imagine the division, now Imagine GTA.  Throw in a little Rainbow 6 and CS:GO and you've essentially got this game.  Really like a Just Cause 2 on Steroids (minus the graple)

Countless guns, insane customization ability, many skins (though non tradeable if that matters), and a fun story.

Combined with the ability to team up with up to 3 others, this game is pretty great.  Now Don't get me wrong, the driving mechanics are not the prettiest, but this isn't GTA.  The game has better graphics than the division (and if you have the game at 1440p Ultra, you better be prepared - 2 1080 FTWs in SLI is averaging me around 70 FPS, though Better performance could probably be easily obtained).  Guns are extreamly detailed, and take cosmetic damage as you use them which you have the option to keep or remove.  Characters are able to be made essentially how ever you want them, and countless stitchable emblems are avialable for use.  

Pros:
Countless Guns
Amazing Customization (Use & Cosmetic)
Driving + Flying + Boating
Good Story
Functioning (and easy to use) multiplayer
Fast Load Time
Great Graphics

Cons:
Graphically Demanding (though easily avoidable)
Driving isn't the smoothest process
Cars take damage fast (cosmetic)

Over all, as I've come to expect with Tom Clancy games, the graphics are great, and the game play is pretty good as well.  A good story (much more elaborate than The Division's in terms of content quantity).

All the game is missing (unless its there and I can't see it) is PvP"

A warning though: I'm using an i5-4690k and a gtx 1070 with the game running on custom settings (somewhere mixed between medium and high and very high with some settings) and it still stuttering. People with weaker/older CPUs be warned, it might run bad."

												This is a truly hidden gem. I mean at first I liked the graphics, but not so much. The control of the vehicles was a bit meh, everything seemed generic not to mention there's no actual storyline except for a few cutscenes here and there, that are passable. 

First encounters AI is like pretty much in every other game. Sneak, kill, whatever. So I was prepared for yet another generic shoot 'em up with no story (not that i care so much) like every other game out there. And I was so not ready for what was yet to come.

Once you get past the easy areas and try something harder the AI starts to shine in a way I have never seen before, and I've seen a lot. It's simply mind blowing, they will call the army to hunt you down, there are going to be inbound choppers on your location, the AI will pin you down and try to flank you in every possible way. They will leave their base and come to rush you on open areas! You will try and run and hide and they will pursue, in the night, with flashlights, through the grass, use the terrain to their advantage and every other trick in the book. 

And you are going to die for every stupid stunt you're trying to pull against the AI. You're going to die a lot, just like in real life combat. And all that on a map so huge you're not going to believe it's even possible. My mind was completely blown. 

The images will still haunt you for hours after you are done playing. The beautiful scenery, the amazing gameplay and the frighteningly close to reality AI, all make for a massive true war zone like experience like I never had experienced before. 10/10 from me on this one guys, it's a must for every military simulation nut out there."

												This game is the best game this far into year 2017. Just what I were hoping for and even abit better!

But first lets talk about what most people expect when given a Tom Clancy and more presice Ghost Recon Game. The Tom Clancy name when attached to games began way back in the days with Rainbow Six Series. It started out with a briliant FPS tactical shooter. And held iself true to it's form for quite awhile. The same can be said about the more open leveled and military focused Ghost Recon games, Though they survived the first evolution into modern days. With a more future soldier(near future that is) focus. The Rainbow six series went from a highly tactical series, into a more action oriented experience. And lately the Ghost Recon Series have passed into the open world genere....

The thing is that this has not been a great secret, and the Open Beta gave anyone the opportunity to look at the different aspects of the game. So noone should be suprised here....


For me this game can be summed up like this: It's not deep, but i'ts a hell of a fun game.  To quote Hot Shots 2.. War It's fantastic! IN other words this is a game that makes you feel like a-team or some other epic action movie`series dudes.

Yes the game have some funny physics regarding cars, the steering of helicopters, boats and car/bikes feels abit not true. But Then again this is not a Military/rally/life sim. It's an open world game where the main focus is fights!

So what about fights you say? Well, if you do everything well, every engagement is easy, but one slipup and you feel it. This is especially noticable in Coop, as in singleplayer you will always be revived(once pr battle) by NPC teamates.

The game has some briliant solutions, the syncronized shot ability is awsome in singleplayer, and in coop you use it to mark  primary targets(atleast my regular playergroup does so). And it works fine. 

Weapons, yes you must locate end pick new weapons(and weapon attachments) up at differnet locations, but you uncover these places by sheer luck or finding intel. ANd the weapon customizer is awsome!

Story: Well Ecil drug dudes, pressure Bolivia to ignore them, and weeho enter America(!) special forces.. Time to make a cleanup on line 9.....

Works well as a background thing for your wild moviestyle action! 


Graphics, stunningly beautiful landscape, Now I wish to travel to south america again. Nice weather effects, and sun+mountains+ some fog and clouds are just worth screenshots!


All in all 8.5 out of 10. Game is a good Far Cry meets Just Cause kinda game, but carves it's own slice of the Openworld cake!
(better vehicle handling would put it up to a 9 out of 10)"

												Instead of a really long boring paragraph, I'll just do a quick pro vs con list

Pros:
- Huuuuuuuge World
- Infinte ways to approach a scenario
- RPG like leveling and skills
- Plenty of guns and gear with lots of customization
- Tons of Main Missions
- Tons of Side Missions which adds to helping allies
- Grahpically Beautiful (Draw distnace is A1)
- Coop is tons of fun
- 30+ hours of gameplay
- Sound is great for this type of game
- Singleplayer is even fun (atleast for me)

Cons:
- AI is pretty wonky, will duck if shot at but thats about it
- Bit reptive over time (not too bad but some will mind)
- Few quirks and bugs (nothing game breaking)
- Uplay (not too bad since i run thro Steam, just adds bootup time)

Neutral (some will like, some won't, I just dont mind):
- Microtransactions (nothing pay to win thankfully)
- Season pass doesn't seem worth it
- Takes a long time to traverse the world at times"

												I'm not someone who grew up with Ghost Recon. Wildlands is the first Ghost Recon game I've ever played. I can't tell you whether or not this is a good Ghost Recon game. I can tell you, however, that it is a fantastic game, particularly if you enjoy tactical espionage action. Some elements of the gameplay are rough, but it's obvious to see how much care and attention to detail the developers put into the parts that they thought were important, like the stealth, the weapon and character customization, the landscapes, the gunplay, the setting options, or the enemy AI. It's all extremely fun to play when everything is going well. I highly recommend playing on the highest difficulty."

												This is your definition of a solid 7.
There is nothing mind-blowing or innovative about Ghost Recon Wildlands, but it's a solid game that works and really scratches that open world shooter itch (at least for me)

The game is structured nearly identical to Metal Gear Solid V, so it comes with both that games pros and its cons.
 It's a huge beautiful open world filled with enemy outposts that you can approach tactically in a number of ways. Go in with a helicopter guns blazing or sit back and pick off targets with your drone and your synch shot.
There is plenty of customization and gear to unlock, which helps keep things interesting as new weapons and gadgets increase the variety iof ways n which you can take down foes. There are tons of side missions scattered around the huge open world to collect supplies which are vital to upgrading your skills and upgrades for your rebel support. 

However that is pretty much it and like MGS V while fun and tactical the game does get repetitive. Now I managed to get 40 hours out of it and thats not including the betas and frankly I could still go for more, but I can definitely see how it could get repetitive sooner for others, it will really depend on how much of an itch you have to play an open world tactical shooter.

Other things to note would be the incredibly mundane story and dialouge which is so platitudiness and vacuous it is almost a parody of itself.The driving in the game isnt great either, very arcadey. Also as a solo player I wish there was more control over your AI squadmates, but the synch shot is pretty satisfying.

All in all GR:Wildlands is a solid mechanically sound game set in a beautiful open world bogged down by a generic story and a structurally repetitive framework. I played solo but I am sure that playing co-op would add a whole new layer of depth and fun to the game

												Really enjoying this game, It runs really well on my mediocure machine (GTX 960 Ti). The gun play is fun, and the story is actually good if you read and watch all the intel clips you can pick up. Don't mind the weinies saying this game is frustrating, they just haven't figured out how to be tactical and use the game's mechanics to their advantage. I have not had any issures with connectivity either so it may be some folks just don't have their NAT type set properly. The views in this game are pretty breath taking with the fidelity and amount of detail that has been put into the world map.

OVERALL: 8/10 
GRAPHICS: 9/10
FUN (with friends 10/10) (without friends 7/10)

If you like open world games and military style shooters this one is a must in my book."

												This game is honesty god awful Heres WHY:
1. The voice acting is lazy I just hear the same thing over and over again. I.E. La ♥♥♥♥♥♥ culeros and ♥♥♥♥ balls. 

2. I dont care about the character for examle Weaver is just black guy with a sniper rifle. 

3. The bosses' weapons are abosolute garbage. You can't customize them like put a silencer on them so they are basically useless.
 
4. The Missions are repetitive
 
5. You cant get in the back of a truck. It is in the ♥♥♥♥ing trailer and screenshot loading screens wtf. You can't shoot in the trunks of the SUV.

6. The Weapons: You can just look up the best guns in the game and not spend anytime using different guns, so all the different guns are useless. (should have been lvl based)

7. The bosses not hard at all even on the hardest difficulty. Example: For one of the bosses I just drove an explosive drone to him and killed him. 

8. You can't choose which vehicale you can spawn. I don't want to spawn in a god damn helicopter every ♥♥♥♥ing time.

9. Lazy voice acting design: When I am playing Coop with people the main character voice switches to different people. Also there two players and 4 people talking. 

10. Your teamates are useless when doing convoys missions.

11. The convoy missions are all the same 2 cars and 1 trucks.
 
12. In my opinion the game is not very difficult. I am playing on the hardest difficulty and the game is still easy.
 
13. There is more just cant think of them. (cont.) 

14. Customize your character: the Saturation is all wrong with the tops. It does not match the legs

15. The A.I. look all the same. For example the Lt. all look like cholos and rebels faces are all the same. Also the Unidad and cartel look the same. ( i am talking about the faces)

All in all the Ubisoft is lazy company make decent to ♥♥♥♥ games and I would score this to be a 5 out of 10 so Meh. In The End customize your guy is more fun than the game.

Playing with friends is funny because we ♥♥♥♥ around but the actual game is ok."

												GRW has a lot to criticize. Mostly it's repetitive gameplay, superfluous weapons, awful aircraft controls and confusing vehicle design. Beneath that though lies a solid, immensely enjoyable co-op game that gives you and your friends a run for your money and tactical skill in a huge, beautiful environment. 

There is so much I'd like to say and spoil, but if you liked the outpost sections from Far Cry and weapon customization this is the game for you. It's a tactical shooter that's unforgiving but also great fun. It takes time and skill to learn, but when you do it never ceases to surprise you or catch you off guard. 
While a lot of the weapons in the game seem to have little purpose except as filler (Why you would want to use a bolt-action sniper rifle that has worse damage, handling and penetration stats than a semi-automatic one, I don't know), but they handle well, offer a wide variety and land each kill with a very satisfying *THUNK* sound.

Get it with friends, play it for a weekend, and enjoy the hell out of parachuting from a kilometer up in the air only to miss the chute release and land balls-first on a wooden fence."

												If you like games where you sneak in and kill everyone slow and quiet like Tenchu, or conversely crazy random action like GTAV, Co-op games, 3rd person shooters like the Division, etc... you'll very likely love this.  As I do.

Superb graphics, and detail.
Huge open world, and I mean absolutely HUGE.
Cool weapon customizations... practically gun porn.
Driving and flying with a controller is great, not so much on KB&Mouse.
LOTS to do and collect.
Non-Linear missions, it's got that ""Start the game and go where you want"" feel that Skyrim has!
Runs at 70fps on my rig (gtx1070)
Anyway, can't say enough good things about this.  I'm having a blast... 
Speaking of which, gonna go play more right now!  
One of the few AAA games out that are worth the ridiculous standard asking price of $79.99"

												not too shabby so far Ubisoft, I'm actually kinda proud of you.


Looks great, minor fps issues still linger but pretty fantastically optimized.


I can't tell ya much about the kids difficulties but throwing this ♥♥♥♥ on the hardest makes things pretty intense like realism mode tends to do in Tom Clancy games.


Play with your friends, that was one of the main selling points of the game. Games are boring if you make them boring, stop expecting Call of Duty to come out for the first time again its a military shooter for christ's sake."

												Ok so far, Ghost recon wildlands is a combination of ""the division"" ""mad max""
Im waiting for it to be like a ghost recon game but i dont see that happening
and of course it has the stank of microtransactions.

This game is going to be alot of repetitive gameplay, capturing bases, taging loot, collecitng intel, but i can tell its a well balanced kind of repetitive gameplay that does not get annoying, unlike metal gear solid 5. Also, this is not quite like any previous ghost recon game ive played, not a bad thing, but hardcore fans beware, this may be a fan base split for you guys, watch some gameplay before you buy. If your not a hardcore fan and you like tatical espionoge shoot em ups, then go for it this game cant dissapoint you."

												I really wanted to enjoy this game. Open world, stealth, shooter... Everything I personally like in a game. During the open beta, the game ran flawlessly on mostly high settings minus one which I had to keep low due to vram usage. However the game is now completely unplayable and freezes anytime I'm near enemies or driving. Now I know other people with higher end cards have not had issues, however my gtx 770 is now unable to run it.

Various fixes didn't work. Turning off the controller, disabling vsync, locking the fps to 60... I tried restarting the game, restarting my computer, validating the files. 

Now, in terms of gameplay during the open beta, the game was amazing. Single player and coop were both immensely fun to run around and stealth my way through all of the different camps. The gunplay was good, and the AI, while a bit stupid at times, generally provided an entertaining challenge. For many people, however, the game will become very repetitive. It's a lot of go to point A so you can go to point B. Clear the enemies so you can clear more enemies. 

My final opinion is that the game is worth playing, however it is currently unplayable. At least in my case that holds true."

												This game replaces the bullet-spongy enemies and the monotonous corridor shooting of The Division, and revamps it into an open-world set smack in the middle of Bolivia with lots of foliage and vegetation, and where enemies are deadly.

A must-buy for both the casual gamer and the military tactitian!

WARNING: This game DOES have microtransactions. However, most can be unlocked through regular game progression and collectables, and doesn't take a stupidly long time to do so. Stay away from them, and play the game as it should be played."

												I am a miltary sim nut. Not the biggest fan of spawn in shooters like COD or Battlefield, though I do like Battlefield 1 for quick action hour fun. Huge Arma and flight sim fan. Also always liked GTA. I thought this game would be like Just Cause 3, but much better. I say Wildlands finds a middle ground between the old Ghost Recon games and GTA. It's a beautiful mixture of the two. Flight physics are good for an open world game. Helicopters basically switch from auto hover to fixed wing once to speed and makes a good transition without rudder pedals. Can coast sideways at slow speeds and believable when engaging a convoy. Squad orders in SP, though primitive actually serve a purpose. Use the ""go to"" and ""regroup"" a lot in a firefight and it has a positive impact. Combat is fun and surprisingly tactical for a GTA style game. World is huge and beautiful. I'm running a GTX 960 with 8 gb ram. I have to keep textures on low but everything else is on and ultra and get 60 fps. JC3 not so much. Customization of weapons and character is large. If you are a military fan and like GTA, this game is a must have."

												Please consider this game right now to be [Early Access]

Sandbox FPS with some tactical elements, throw in some GTA elements, ability to make a custom character + customize your loadouts - then add in some BF elements and just cause style chaos and you have Wildlands. There are some issues though such as air combat with Helicopters is bad, and the driving physics is sometimes wonky and occasionally you might run into some really funny glitches, but overall - it doesn't really make the game any less fun to play. 

The graphics are amazing, bolivia looks stunning. If your looking for a FPS game thats fun to play and you have time to burn, since it'll take along time to collect all the items and finish all the content then check out wildlands.

Stealth vs Loud; The former is one of the problems with the game as quite a few missions require perfect stealth to complete otherwise its instant fail and you have to restart; many of these are nearly impossible in public co-op for the obvious reasons, whilst failing or dying has little consquence it can become annoying having to keep backtracking in order to complete the missions and as for death, put it simply you'll die - a lot most of the time you'll suffer WTF deaths or unfair deaths due to narcos or unidad spawning from thin air.

The AI is horrible, your team mates are literally just tag alongs most of the time- in fact, if you had the option to go alone it probably would be better since they are that dumb. Enemy AI is broken as well, some enemies function with zero brain functions and will just allow you to kill them easily, others will know exactly where you are at all times - they'll shoot through walls, fire mortars - enemy helicopters will circle you constantly until you can kill them, and by the way? Totally forget about surviving against unidad apache gunships.

Pros

Awesome Graphics and Scenery
Plenty of collectables
Good co-op experience
Fun to play
Character and Weapon Customization

Cons

Bugs and glitches everywhere
Bad A.I
Bad co-op experiences
Bad Driving mechanics
Potentially P2W
Micro-transactions"

games beatiful i run it at around 50-80 fps on ultra setting long shadows and enchanced god rays and nvida turf and hbao on loading screens are kinda long but i end up with a smooth running game and now missing textures. weapon custimization is pretty cool and im glad you cant just use everything right off the bat and have to work for it but.....it is anyoing at times since i need to go through a whole military base just to get a scope for my assualt rifle but its all part of the kit. overall rating 8.5/10"

												Downvotes for Ubisoft games are usually very common, mainly because the company itself is pure cancer and treats their customers like ♥♥♥♥. With Ghost Recon Wildlands they offer about everything I hate about modern video gaming: Pre-order DLC, ""Deluxe Edition"" with additional cosmetic items, Season-Pass and Microtransactions that would even be too much in a f2p title. So I'm missing out on tons of stuff by ""just"" spending 60€ (and not preordering).
So if you ask me, Ubisoft deserves all the disrespect there is and even more.

BUT: Would I still recommend Ghost Recon Wildlands? Yes, definitely! All the hate for Ubisoft and their shady business practises can't change that this is a very enjoyable game, set in a beautiful world with an intense atmosphere. The story is interesting so far and the storytelling through a lot of different types of sources makes it even more enjoyable (Videotapes, Phonecalls, Audiotapes, interrogations and other cutscenes etc.).

Just don't buy the crap they offer. Don't get cosmetics, additional weapons, XP Boosts, don't pre-order and let the season pass go ♥♥♥♥ himself! This is the only way things will ever change back to the good, where we receive 100% of the product for 100% of an AAA titles price."

												                                           [IF YOU DON'T HAVE FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH DONT BUY THIS GAME ]
Ghost reacon Wildlands is a beautiful tactical shooter at it's core but lacks some serious features of a AAA standard game.
After craeting a character (Which is lame by the way, its just some random cosmetics except the cool ones locked behind paywall ). Then i joined one of my buddy in co op and played for straight 3 to 4 hours, it was fun but ..... but that's it that is the whole backbone of the game.
For me it's.
                  Graphics : HUGE map with stunning visuals, character and gun models are top notch, day night cycle with weather fx is awesome.

                   Audio & Sound fx : OKish voice acting with sub-par sound fx but i feel like every weapon has same sound almost , with a silencer its PEW PEW without it phut phut.... It is not acceptable for a tactical shooter.

                   Gameplay : It's fun but very repetative but in a good way, scout the area be stealthy or just gunblaze. The AI though are either very stupid or the game feels easy on the hardest difficulty FTW ubisoft (Yes I'm looking at The Division). Again the vast map is beautiful but feels very empty just like Just cause 3. Objectives are same from the first 3 hour , go there kill him/her , go there capture and extract intel , ton of lame fetch quest , till you face the boss , some lame guy with random tatoos on em. No character devlopment no charisma nothing pure tasteless.

                     Overall : For me it is a wait for sale because if you get it now and you dont have friends to play with then you will get bored in 3 to 4 hours ."

												Realy fun! :D 20+ hours in Open Beta
Do NOT play this alone, find someone with similar playstyle and taste as you and you will have an amazing time.

AI: 7/10 they pretty much have aimbot but they act very human while passive
Gameplay: 8.5/10 starts to feel MGS:FP'ish after a while but not quite
Graphics: 9/10
Driving: 9/10 in open beta, after spoiled kids cried, Devs tried to fix it and failed so i'd say 5/10 now

The game is a Blast, i suggest playing with one person though as 3 or 4 might become chaotic. Feels Perfectly made for 2 people."

												Game is amazing! There is not enough space to write down all positive things.
But there are 3 annoying things:
1. FPS drops,
2. In some situations Sicario's spawns behind back,
3. Civilian AI is just stupid.

Ubisoft, where are radio towers? :D

My Game Rating: 8/10"

												A very cool direction for the Tom Clancy style of games, it's closer to what I hoped the Division would be at launch.

I did the opening mission, then went running off into the jungle on my own, tackling cartel bases and stealing cars and ultimately dying after being pinned down in a massive enemy base. Great fun."

												It reminds me a lot of MGSV without the goofy gadgets and story but with added multiplayer. The world is really big the environments are varied and I personally believe the AI are about what you'd expect from this type of game and I dont really see any reason to complain about them. The only downsides about this game are the driving (It's horrible) some pretty frequent crashes and issues with having an ""outdated game"" and the fact that you have to use uplay."

												My review for this will be short; It's an objectively good game, and I thought it would be just my type of game (I love Far Cry, GTA, MGSV, etc) but Wildlands feels like a dry, substandard mixing of those games. Combat feels unsatisfying for whatever reason, the stealth is either too overpowered or not good enough. The amount of times I should or shouldn't have been seen just based on normal ""I am behind a wall, how did he see me"" logic is insane. I played singleplayer, and it felt like an empty world with little personality. I feel like it could be fun with a group of friends, but in my opinion it is not a fun singleplayer experience"

+ map (map size, details, several biomes)
+ in-depth customization of gear (be the ghost you want to be)
+ coop drop in/out seamlessly
+ random fun moments with friends
+ teamwork pays off
+ HUD can be toggled on/off and can be customized as well
+ gameplay feels ""right""
+ high immersion (without HUD)
+ character animations very smooth and realistic (climbing out of a car window if the door is stuck)

o missions (a few are interesting, some are dull, repetitive, however, they do the job)
o performance/ optimization could be better

- AI sometimes too good at aiming (dual-wielding MAC10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will kill you instantly over a range of 150m)
- lack of enemy variation
- singleplayer experience mediocre at best (better with friends)
- car/ helicopter/ plane physics rather bad (also cars are too similar to each other)


If you are looking for an open world title to play with a friend/ friends there is nothing you can do wrong with Ghost Recon Wildlands. In short, it is a solid game (singleplayer)/ a great game (multiplayer).

8/10."

												Definitely a big yes from me. In general the game looks amazing, feels amazing, is amazing and has tons of content in it. The mainstory alone has hours and hours of missions to do, the difficulties are perfectly set up in my personal opinion with the enemies offering a challenge even with the regular difficulty (Played regular on Open Beta and Advanced after launch)

Pro's and con's from me

Pro's :
+ Long mainstory
+ Cutscenes are extreamly well made, which definitely makes them interesting and worth watching
+ Graphics
+ Amazing background for the story
+ Missions offer a lot of variety and there is a lot of different ways to do them
+ Co-op campaign
+ Realistic bulletdrop
+ Skill tree has some extreamly useful skills

Cons :
- Driving glitching out like hell occasionally
- Crashing into a rock causes your characther to fly hundereds of meters in air
- Flying on helicopters
- Glitches with missions while playing co-op (Happens rarely, either one or more of the guys in the same game are able to only join the mission as assistance > completing the mission wont complete it for them)
- A number of stuck spots, mainly by cliff's and containors that are placed too close to a wall etc.


Overall the game is definitely worth the money, been playing co-op for 34hours (Only doing missions while in co-op with a friend) and we have 95 main missions completed which takes us to total of 89% of the main storyline done.

Personally my favorite thing in the game is definitely hitting them longshots, there is nothing better than hitting a clean shot to a moving target thats 600-700meters away from you (Now I know the drawdistance for enemies etc is 650meters but you can override this by having a friend thats closer to the enemies.)"

												Without playing the beta, and giving into the ""hype"". I came into GRW (Ghost Recon Wildlands) expecting the absolute worst. Ubisoft has always rubbed me the wrong way, and I talked a ton of trash about GRW prior to release, so the only reason I was buying GRW was for the weapon and gear customization, and co-op. When I first hopped in I spent a good 20-30 minutes creating and saving 6 different Ghost kits to my liking. I had heard that the game was extremely easy so I instantly put the game on Extreme difficulty, and haven't changed it since. I then hopped in with a few friends and started playing. I am absolutly blown away, this game has far exeeded my expectations. There's ton of content in this game, and everything you do, from finding skill points, to finding weapons, and attachments are all challenging, and unique in their own way. With over 35 hours played in the first week, I have only beaten 6 of the 25ish bosses. This is truly a great game, but with every great game comes problems. The first problem I encountered was performance issues, on very high I was running at 40ish FPS, and that's extremly unusual for me. So I've bumped it down to Medium for the time being, to insure I'm getting over 60 FPS. The second issue that I had, was that upon re-launching the game, the game would not start. My friend and I both had this issue, and took some time to resolve it. The third issue, is the driving/flying mechanics. They are absolutly awful. The driving is stupid sensitive, and the flying with M+KB feels wonky and awkward, and don't even get me starting on driving the dirt bikes... Over all I am really enjoing this game, I am very picky when it comes to video games, and have never found a game that deserves a perfect 10/10, and that still stays true. I would give this game a 7/10 singleplayer and a 8/10 with friends. GRW could be so much more if Ubisoft would add mod support, but we all know that will never happen. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open world games, and people who enjoy a challenge in video games. But in order for this to be a true Ghost Recon game, there needs to be a difficulty higher than Extreme. Maybe we will see that in the future."

Pros
-Great concept, I love the idea of hunting down the different leaders of the cartel
-Great customization
-Good graphics

Cons
-Gameplay is repetitve and gets boring quick
-Everything on the map looks the same. You have your different regions that look different enivornmentally but other than that nothing really stands out.

Conclusion:
It is not a terrible game and many people will like it but to me it got boring real quick. It had a good impression at first and I love the concept but the game itself doesn't excite me."

												NOTE: I played the Open Beta when Ubisoft was nice enough to let the general public play.  My total game hours including that are small, but enough to make this review possible by viewers like you.  Thank you.

Ever want the gun customization of Fallout 4 without the ""this just ups damage and range"" and box you into a useless amount of that crap?  Ever want a nearly truly customizable character?  How bout driving UP mountains but not have to worry about committing atrocious crimes all the time?  (well... maybe a little.  ... maybe a lot)

Then Wildlands is for you!

Graphically Wildlands is a very pretty game.  The landscape, though sometimes bland, still looks gorgeous as a mountainous region of Bolivia.  Character models aren't really anything to write home about but I'm not too anal about that.  Gun models, textures, and other small details are gorgeous to say the least and easy on the eyes.

The sound in this game is... well, sound.  It's not fantastic, not poor, but it's there.  Think of GTA:V's ambience since The Division is something we don't talk about.

The gunplay:  The gunplay is what you'd expect (or not) from a Tom Clancy game.  It's no longer in first-person as you might have seen, but AMS IS or you can change the option for a more traditional third-person shooter view.  Personally?  I like the deparature.  Camera angles aren't too buggy, it flows well, and nothing really gets in the way of what you want to do.  Customizing your weapons has a wide variety of options too.  From barrels, sights, stocks, even the ♥♥♥♥ing firing mech you can toy with.  Plus paint, because everyone loves a truly custom weapon of pure death.

Lastly, the co-op.  This game is way more fun with co-op and spreading your mayhem across Bolivia's massive landscape.  I don't need to say much more than GTA: Online's co-op with friends... only if people weren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on that.

												Here's the deal, short and sweet. There are plenty of things that could have been done better, but I am enjoying the gameplay so far, because the things that I have to complain about are not enough to stop me from enjoying it.

Cons: (AKA stuff that really should not be an issue in 2017)
After you swap your gun for a gun on the ground, you cannot pick your 1st gun up, it just disappears and you have to find a weapons locker to re-equip it if you don't like the new one.

Absolutely god awful 3rd/1st person switching to aim down the sights.

No ""shoulder swap"" button for the camera. I've been ""stuck"" in left handed over the shoulder cam mode ever since I went into cover in a corner, and the only way to change it back is to try to manipulate it back to the right shoulder through the cover mode system.

Terrible vehicle controls. I mean, it's a Ubisoft title, so this is no surprise. When has ANY Ubi game EVER had good driving? Never. But this is pretty bad, even for Ubi. I espected FarCry levels of crappy handling, but this makes Farcry's vehicle handling look like  a racing sim.

Loading times. Now obviously these will vary from rig to rig, but man this is the slowest loading game I own. I can have Witcher III up and running on max and be in-game in about 30 seconds, including splash screens  and stuff, but it took 15-20 seconds for my characters CLOTHES to change in the creation menu. I don't know why, there was virtually no buffer time in between changing options in the beta. Who knows, maybe itll get better with a patch.

Movement feels kind of slow and clunky. I get the realism aspect of it and am really attracted to the less ""run and gun"" aspect, but it kind of feels like you are slogging through molasses. If movement actions are going to be so slow, at least give me like a dive-into-prone option or something. MGS: Phantom Pain brings to mind a really well done movement system. I mean, for pete's sake, you can't even sprint while crouched. I know that you can't really ""sprint"" when you are hunched over, but most games have a ""scoot-boogey-shuffle faster"" sprint for when you're crouched.

And the voice acting/script in general is as bad as all the other reviews say. It's not like they are super bad at delivering their lines, the dialog itsself just seems flat. The voice actors do an ok job considering they are only reading what is in front of them.

All in all, I liked the bit I've seen. Most of the things I have to gripe about is just ""videogame stuff"", that you are going to find pretty much anywhere in games, by and large. I think there are a lot of people who have it out for Ubi, and will never be pleased with anything they release because they have a chip on their shoulder (and with some of their business practices like their pricing structures and DLC sales, I do not blame them), but I try not to boycott entire companies, and evaluate on a more game-by game basis. 

Bottom line, I would wait until this is 50% off or so, because there are other good titles with very similar gameplay for cheaper. I justified speding 60 bucks on this because I needed something new and it was worth not waiting for a sale to come along. I'd say ignore the negative reviews and at least give it a try. Worst case scenario is you refund it."

												Denis Villeneuve's masterpiece: SICARIO was the movie...
Ghost Recon Wildlands is the game.

Now Wildlands isn't a perfect game, just came out, still in need of patching, updating and fixes but...
It is, still, in my opinion, one hell of a solid good game to enjoy!

You're a Ghost, sent to dismantle one of the biggest cocaine cartel of Bolivia, run by: El Sueno and his legion of underbosses, smugglers, scientists, war caids, rich connected ♥♥♥♥ers and such, controlling the whole damn country, bribing the police, armed forces, media, all the way up to the governement.

The map is giganti-huge, and you'll have fun in it for months depending if you're playing solo or with up to 3 friends co-op style. I would highly recommend co-op, even if solo is still very nice, it's far from being as fun as playing with friends.

PROS:
-Amazing crazy ultra-realistic graphics!
-Very smooth gameplay, well optimized.
-Huge frekin' map of Bolivia states, regions and sub-regions.
-Gazilion customization options for weaps, gears, appearance, clothings and more!
-Basic story at 1st, transforming itself into a complex drug cartel drama! Loving it!
-Tons of gadgets, tools, high-tech stuff to use, as well as calling rebels to help in many different situations.
-Good skill lvling system, lvling up main skills, weaps, medal perks, squad skills, rebel skills etc etc.
-Zero linear missions, everything is 100% up to you the way you want to approach missions, intel, recon and such.
-100% open world.

CONS: 
-To be able to enjoy the new visuals and ultra-realistic graphics fully, you'll need quite a powerful rig.
-Vehicules are very fun to use, ground, helicopters, planes etc, but can be hard to maneuver at 1st.
-If you play solo, some side gathering missions can become a bit boring after like 30h of gameplay.
-No manual jumping system, so some of the area i wanted to jump to were not working well even if most of the time the auto-jump is working as intended, it could be better and optimized a bit more.

In the end, i still really enjoy GR Wildlands every day, playing with friends or by myself.
No matter if you go all out crazy style, or role-playing military recon to the max, you'll have a very good time.

												After playing for a few hours it is clear that some major improvments over the beta have been made, especially to the connectivity and driving controls. The game has a few bugs and glitches and has performance issues but the gameplay and world design make up for it and i would definatly recomend this game to anyone with a GPU with 4GB VRAM or more. If you have less than 4gigs you may not be able to run the game at very high settings as the game is quite demanding due to its size and scope. I will update this if anything changes but so far its the best coop open world game i have played in years."

												I honestly thought this game was going to be fun. I had put about 26 hours into the open beta and I loved it. I dont even play the game for more than 20 minutes now because the game just simply frustrates me. Theres a lot of things that have been said about this game that needs to be improved and some of those problems are what is keeping me from fully enjoying this game. I didnt want to believe it but this game really is repetitive. The game in general is very stale very bland. Theres no point in playing stealthy because no matter what, your always gonna leave a huge compound guns blazing. The npc's have the same dialogue as do the rebels and your AI teammates. Your gonna find yourself flying off dirt bikes and dying when your not even driving that fast, The enemys know your location instantly after you have been spotted almost as if every cartel member in the compound all share the same brain. The frame rate drops are unbelievable. One minute Ill be playing at high 60 fps low 70s then out of nowhere im at 40 fps with my gtx 1060 playing at high settings. At this point in the game im extremely tired of clearing out compunds. This game gets boring early on in the game. I really dont recommend spending 60 dollars on a game like this I dont think this game is even worth 40 dollars honestly."

												Really enjoying this game, It runs really well on my mediocure machine (GTX 960 Ti). The gun play is fun, and the story is actually good if you read and watch all the intel clips you can pick up. Don't mind the weinies saying this game is frustrating, they just haven't figured out how to be tactical and use the game's mechanics to their advantage. I have not had any issures with connectivity either so it may be some folks just don't have their NAT type set properly. The views in this game are pretty breath taking with the fidelity and amount of detail that has been put into the world map.

												Ghost Recon : Wildlands is a fantastic co-op game. I think that's the most important thing to put out there, right off the bat. Will you have fun solo? Sure. Just not as much as you would with a friend, not nearly as much. 
GRW is essentially a 40 hour work week friendly co op game - you probably won't miss much by not paying attention to the story, and you don't have to play for hours and hours to get a firm grasp on the mechanics of the game. I don't mean this in a bad way, it's great for me as I constantly work and attend classes, I don't have as much time for gaming as I used to. However, for the player looking for that Tom Clancy experience that we got back in the day from the likes of Rogue Spear, Island Thunder, and Chaos Theory - that's gone. This is a fantastic game - it's just not as solemn and realistic as the TC titles used to be. 
As far as performance goes, this game doesn't run amazingly or poorly. With a GTX 1060 6gb, 8gb of RAM, an i5 7500 @ 3.4, and a 144hz monitor, this game looks great and doesn't stumble on itself too much with a mixture of high / ultra settings. 
Overall, if you're looking for a slightly tactical shooter to scratch your co-op itch, you're in the right place. This game does a great job of being easily accessible to most everyone, making it pretty easy to find a friend to head out into Bolivia with and kick some Santa Blanca butt. If you're seeking more than a great co-op experience, I might skip this one."

												This is my first Ghost Recon game so I might have a more sentimental than critical view on the game generally. I got really frustrated at first especially due to the stuttering problem I was having with the game which definitely had nothing to do with my PC specs. I felt like if I had written the review before I got it fixed, it would probably have been a thumbs down because the game is really promising. I like the whole idea behind the plot and the game setting even though its not exactly accurate. Not veryexpansive with character customization but the variety in outfits makes up for it, sort of. It also comes with a good number of guns that we probably know and love from the division and battlefield franchises, most of which have to be retrieved or bought. I dont see it having a high replay value though once the boss has been taken care of. Sure, there are rebel missions and skill missions that can be undertaken after but it is rendered moot once the goal of the game has been accomplished unless you want to completely take over with maxed out rebel support and player skills. All in all, I think its a very good game that will be fun playing both with friends and solo as the AI are fully engaged and tactical as well (sometimes I prefer using them to actual players), I'm excited for what the game has in store for the near future and I really hope it gets new content!"

												Played the game three seperate times before release and i saw lots of progression with fixing bugs and optimization.
If i ever had any complaints about the gameplay, It's Unidad, They are just a faction that either offer a challenge or just chew through your team.

As far as the game runs, I witness microstutters but they don't last long.
Game locks up for half a second every now and then.
Game still needs some more love.

Also on a side note, Even though i made a promise to a friend to wait for him before doing the story,
I still feel overwhelmed by how massive the map is and how much of the map is alive at any given time"

												Pulled into the brush, getting ready to hit an outpost.  The radio blasting some funky latin ♥♥♥♥.  The music stops and the dj says its time for a public service announcement.  The message?  ""You don't ♥♥♥♥ with Santa Blanca.""  They then proceded to execute a man who had f'd with them...some por schmuck named George.   But they weren't done yet.  The dj announced that the 10th caller would win George's gold watch.

												First of all the game is a blast to play. The combat is fun and engaging, not to mention very satisfying. There are lots of activities to do, and lots of guns and skills to unlock. It feels very rewarding getting better guns in the harder areas, as well as receiving special weapons from taking down bosses. 

The graphics are great. And as far as I can tell, the game on all ultra looks identical to the E3 gameplay we saw a year or two back, minus a few animation changes and less scripted situations. Normally in a game with a map this big, you'd think it'd be a burden to just walk to certain waypoints, but in this game its very enjoyable and really immersive to just hike through the dense jungles or through the towns and villages.

We also practically got exactly what was advertised as well. Ubisoft stuck with their word and dropped a very good, not downgraded game which is exactly how it should be. 

The micro-transactions don't bother me at all. I haven't felt forced at all to buy some credits and spend it on weapon attachments, since everything is attainable in game without too much difficulty. I guess it works out if you're lazy. Most of the other items are purely cosmetic, so to each their own. 

The vehicle controls could use some work, I see that it tends to be the main issue everyone has with the game, but it isn't game breaking. The controls are somewhat sensitive but they can be adjusted so youre not constantly tapping the A and D keys just to turn. I suggest just sticking to main roads unless you have a dirt bike or dunebuggy, otherwise you wont have a very good time driving off road :P

Other then that, it's an awesome game, and I'd say its worth the money."

												Very Positive? I'm honestly shocked, I guess I'll be ""that guy""....


Buckle Up Buckeroo.....


In A Nutshell: Wildlands offers a very fun short term experience, especially with friends. Remember when No Man's Sky was getting rave reviews from people who had put hardly any time into it and not even left the starting planet? The same thing is happening here. Ghost Recon Wildlands(GR:W) offers a lot of fun initial experience, the first few hours are a blast when you're not really geared and missions seem fresh. 

After getting the pace of the game things start to feel very bland and repetitive. Yes, you can ""approach missions differently"", I guess? How many different ways can you approach breaking into an enemy base/stronghold? You're still doing the same thing, either trying to sneak in quietly or blowing the doors off.  The outcome is that either you kill everyone off without being detected, or you deal with constant waves of ""reinforcements"" (Ok, if they are cartel, they usually stop after you've killed everyone who knows you are there)


Now as mentioned above, this game is MUCH more enjoyable with friends, I haven't played any matches with Randoms, because why would I? The biggest reason I suggest playing with friends though is because the AI Teammates are LITERALLY USELESS. You are forced into playing the ""Stealth"" approach on Advanced or Extreme difficulty frankly due to the fact that the Enemy AI are 360 No Scoping Aimbots who can detect and find you no matter where you go once they get tipped off, while your team Ghosts will literally stand next to the enemy as the bad guy shoots you to death. DON'T TRUST YOUR AI BATTLE BUDDY!



If you are looking for a ""military"" themed sandbox to mess around in for a few days and that experience is worth $60 to you, GR:W is the game for you, otherwise, it's very very repetitive, the AI is absolutely terrible, the flying controls are dumbed down in attempt to make it so ""everyone"" can use them to the point that everyone is just frustrated with them, the render distance on enemies is VERY short in comparison to the world around you (At 600M enemy infantry models despawn, odd in a game with multiple weapons whose max effective range is more than double that).


Ghost Recon Wildlands lacks any depth and in all honesty, It is The Division with dialed down RPG mechanics and zero depth once you get bored with the same missions over and over and over and over. Of my currently 72 hours played on Day 5 of release (STEAM COUNTS CLIENT RUNNING AS PLAY TIME, dont have 96 hours active play, you tard troll morons) , I would say a hefty portion of those have been just messing around with friends, the issue is there are game mechanics and designs that make even that a pain instead of just being a fun side option. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's the best I can do to sum up GR:W without going super into detail yet still explaining my reasoning, below is a much more in depth Pro/Con & Thoughts


Pros:

- Very Robust Weapon Choices across multiple ""Classes"" of weapon

- Each weapon usually has a large group of choices in weapon parts to further create depth

- The open and hostile world makes for some incredible moments when playing with friends

- The game world looks really great! I'm on a 970 4gb card and running on High it looks pretty great!

- The story, if you pay attention to it all, is actually pretty cool and interesting

- The different game difficulty options scale how nasty the enemy is, not how bullet sponge/weak you are

- Character customization is awesome! I think we waited for almost 30 minutes for one friend on release night because he was playing around with the outfits for so long, best part is you can change your look anytime you want!

- Base Jumping anyone? It's really cool and you feel pretty accomplished when you pull off a short fall jump because it isn't like Battlefield 4's ""You can parachute from anything!"" I've seen so many pancaked friends....full ptsd.



Cons:

- Team AI is absolutely HORRIBLE. Your fellow ghosts will fail to fire, cover your back, anything. They are utterly useless for anything besides using the Mark/Sync Shot exploit to shoot enemies through walls/houses/etc. To make it worse, the games controls were OBVIOUSLY built around console, because to tell them to do anything you have to hold down TAB then use your mouse wheel to scroll left or right along a circle to tell them to Hold Position/Open Fire/Regroup/Go To

- All those Gun choices and Depth are completely meaningless. It all comes down to ""which gun does the most damage and has the largest magazine"". Sniper Rifles are all the same in terms of ballistics when they all have the same parts, so a .50 Cal rifle like the HTI is the clear choice for any long range sniping (The MSR is a close second, but due to the damage the HTI does it one shots Helicopters and most every other vehicle in game) For close quarters sniping (300m or less) one of the high capacity Semi-Auto's works best, however my playstyle is all long range so I just switch to the MSR since the extended magazine for it puts me at 10 and that's more than enough).

- The world is big and beautiful, but it takes forever to get anywhere on the ground, so you need to learn to fly the terrible controls Helicopter and Planes. The controls aren't hard to learn, by the 2nd province I was doing every mission by flying mach 1 up to the target and doing running landings right into the base, the problem is they are SO dumbed down it's frustrating when you can't do what you want. Want to slide/strafe that heli to better land or let your gunners on the skid/minigun take out that vehicle? You can't do that, there's no side to side control, instead the game has Up/Down, Forward/Backwards, and then a blend of Turn/Roll/Slide bound to your A and D keys.

- Dismantling the entire cartel doesn't matter. Even after getting 100% completion with supporting the Rebel forces and killing every single Cartel boss, the only difference in the world is a few more Green dots (rebels) driving around the map, half the time they just cruise right by Cartel & Unidad (the Bolivian corrupt army) forces, so it literally doesn't matter.

- Enemy forces and bases respawn, so added to the fact that there's no real difference to the overall game map, even victories like clearing out an enemy airbase feels pointless, because guess what, EVERYTHING respawns the second you leave the area/render range. 

- Tying into two above points. SAMs. SAMs everywhere. The second you get out of the starting provinces, they are literally everywhere and they lock you regardless of your altitude so the only thing you can do is once you know where they are, try to fly with objects between you when you can, or try dodging the missiles. ""Blow them up FTR!"" Yeah, except when you hunt them all down and blow them up, the second you leave render range, they respawn, so even after you go around finding them all and SAM hunting, they come back the second you leave. Flying in the western provinces (especially the north) is almost annoying enough to make you want to drive 10km instead of fly it.

-Reptitive Missions, everywhere you go, it's the same scheme: Snatch some HVT, Kill some HVT, infiltrate some base without being detected and grab some thing. From the starting province to the last one you complete, it's the same thing over and over.

- The ""call for a vehicle"" rebel perk places your requested Helicopter in the most idiotic places. I've stood on large open flat areas and requested my Vehicle Pickup only to have it spawn on the side of a mountain and then slide and tumble down into something that will snap the rotor blades off the second you get in. Like so many times now I can't even recount.


- UNIDAD: F these guys. They spawn ontop of you and the more you ♥♥♥♥ them off, the worse it gets."

												I have this problem where every once in a while I think, ""Hey, maybe -this- Ubisoft game will be good.""  Then boot it up and realize: crap, this is just another Ubisoft game.  And frankly?  For as expensive as it is, 100$ is what they'd like you to spend with the option for microtransactions, you are getting a mediocre open-world co-op shooter with a veneer of a AAA game.  Here's the thing Ubisoft, if you can't do it well, maybe just don't do it at all.  It honestly feels like every aspect of this game was developed by a different team, and you know what?  It probably was.  So I have no idea who greenlit this game, I have no idea what focus testing led them to the decisions that make it what it is: but it sucks.

If, like me, you don't have a taste for the odd collect-o-thon style gameplay that Ubisoft calls content it's probably not for you anyways.  That said, this game has issues all it's own.  Most noticeably that the AI is total garbage.  Enemies only have three states: unaware, alert and dead.  No 'advanced' behaviors seen in games like MGS:V, Sniper Elite or even Call of Duty, I'm not sure they even seek cover!  And guess what?  Your teammates are somehow worse!  They can't/won't drive, walk out of cover at random, don't effectively engage enemies, teleport to you because they can't pathfind, etc... But oh boy, there is a whopper of a special nail Wildlands coffin: it has GTA-style police and wanted levels.  I'm dead serious.  A tactical co-op shooter about special operations forces has a phantom spawning task force like the police in GTA.  I was awestruck.  Helicopters and Humvees just spawn right in around you.  Thinking back, Wildlands simple gameplay is a lot like GTA III.  Simple AI, wonky physics, arcade-style shooting.  If it weren't for the graphics, you could mistake it for a GTA III mod.  I was under the impression this was some sort of tactical squad-based shooter, not an arcade sandbox!  Pepper in the uninspired missions, writing and upgrade system, and add a strong dose of bugs and I couldn't uninstall and request a refund fast enough.

Let me talk about that AAA veneer real quick though since that's clearly what you are paying for.  Like the gameplay, the graphics in this game are lifeless.  Sure, it has high resolution textures and a heaping nVidia powered eye candy, but everything is static.  If things move, like leaves, it's with canned animations you can watch cycle.  Most things can't be destroyed or damaged.  I'm not even sure they have more than a dozen different models for generic NPCs.  All the graphics in the world can't hide how shallow and uninteresting this world is.  Ubisoft let you torch fields in 2008 with Far Cry 2, yet nine years later they can't manage basic world interaction?  I'm sure this game was very expensive to make, but if they want to pass that cost off on me well, when coupled with the comotose gameplay, I just really don't see where the money is going honestly.

If we learned anything from No Man's Sky it should be it doesn't matter how big your map is if the gameplay is weak.  The map here certainly is huge, but there is little in the way of tactical or strategic depth beyond picking the weapon you think is coolest.  So let me be perfectly blunt: for $100 this game should be a hell of a lot better than this.  This is unacceptable.  I don't recommend it and, since I was idiotic enough to try it, I'm telling you that if you made the same mistake as me and bought it: request a refund.  Ubisoft isn't going to fix this mess."

												I will try to tell ytou my opinion about this game.I will type some not  that much important things,and i will finish with maybe most interesting and important.
1)Game content:Game has massive content.You have 28 bosses(1 big boss,8 medium bosses,and to be able reach this 8 medium,you must defeat 20 mini bosses).Game is all about this few things:taging resources(oil,medicine,ammo),doing side missions for extra points,skills,story missions(after 5 on the start of game,you can kill mini boss,)-didnt come that much far for now,so idk how many story missions you need to do for future mini bosses;grinding weapon things etc
BUT,that famous BUT xD,content is kinda recycled,because 99% of missions are something like:find laptop and hack it,find evidence and take photos for further things,steal car,steal chopper,what is not cool thing in my opinion(6/10)
2)Driving:one word:♥♥♥♥.Because when you are driving,and hit lamppost during 100KM?h or smash civilian with 20KM/h speed,you will get enormous damage.When you are on some parts of road,you will have bluered textrues,which will cause 5s of freezing(but its very very rare thing).(3/10)
3)Graphic and specifications:Graphic is not impressive alot,bejcause if you dont have high-end mosnter,you wont be able to play onm Ultra on 60FPS,and if you play on <ultra,you will not experience that cool graphich.Most likely it's like comic book,because some builidng and Ai bots,ghave sharps and otuliens,which is making me laughing a lot.Specifications:as you can see you need ot have medium OR medium-end pc to play on Low-Medium grpahich in 40-70FPS.G&S(7/10)
4)Gameplay:You have 2 tactics:stealth and loud.You can change always,from one to the second.For example:you are in middle of alert,they are rushing you,and if you hide good,thhan you will lose ""alerted"" and get ""hunted"",since hunted appear,you can silently kill again,and you are good to go.4 difficulties,whhich is good,each one is step harder because you have less downs,less armor,more realistic sscenario,smarter Ai's,and good fight what is most important to some of us.(10/10)
5)Weapns:In standard edition,you havbe massively big inverotry,a lot of weapons,attachments,camos and stuffs.If you want some specific part for weapon you need to look at the map ""M button"",an than search for blue pistol with screw on it,and on that part of map you can get 2 things:small crate with attachemnt OR big one with weapon in it.You can customise weaponms at any time,by simpl pressing of ""M""-invertory-loadout-chose weapon and change.Ammo is not a big deal,because since you are killing ,you can pick ammo,or find 3 bullets icon on map,and resuply you resources.If we have like 30-40 weapons,and like 100 different)not common)) attachemnts in standard game,what do you expect in seaon pass? ^^ (10/10)
6)Pre-conclusion:Is game interesting?Deffinitely yes.Is game well optimised?So-so,Is game funny to play at least 200 hrs?Deffinitelly yeahhh ^^.Is game non-stop grinding like The Division?Not even close;You have offline and online way of playing the same missions.Is game worth 60€?Not even close;Maybe Digital Deluxe for 60€.Standard one should be 40€.KEYS:Standar 25€,Digital 45€(2/10)

Conclusion:Game is very good from gameplay aspect.From techical,it could be better,but we will see in upcoming updates.You can spend a lot of time solo or with friends.But if you still dont wanna pay a lot of money,you can simply wait for Easter sale or buying key cheeper for approx 30€

1)+2)+3)+4)+5)+6)=6.33/10.In case you care about average grade xD"

												Lots of fun solo, haven't really tried with people yet. Just amazing to look at and Ansel images are insane in detail. The game plays well, and although repetative, there's enough diversity in the locations and your approaches that I don't seem to get tired of it. Frame rate also needs improvement. Only getting about 45-60FPS on ultra with GTX1080/i7-7700k at 1440p. Had better frame rate on beta and also controller support... there's something odd going on right now with that.

The AI sucks a bit still and is pretty dumb sometimes, which I hope UBI works on and the driving although fun, has little to no concesquences when you when you decide to defy physics. You can pretty much drive up or down anything, off cliffs, etc and there's no real damage. That would be nice to improve as well.

The one thing completely lacking......in ""Wildlands"" is .... well.... wildlife.... There's a few birds here or there, a couple other mammals in select areas, but you can run km's through mountains, forests, etc and not run into a single animal. Immersion ruined ;)

Good:

-Fun gameplay
-Lots of weapons and accessories
-Drop dead gorgeous graphics
-Very large environment

Bad:

-AI is slow (even your own AI squad)
-Environment can feel empty at times
-Physics are laughable
-Frame rates need working on"

												First impressions:

So far so good. Here are some of (my personal) pros and cons:

Pros: 

- Squad AI is pretty good, the sequence shooting feels pretty stellar, and even though this is probably a design flaw, I like you can just walk through your squad.
- Helicopter controls are good. Easy to control and doesn't feel clunky (this goes for the normal driving too)
- You can opt in for guns blazing, or genuine stealth. It's not over if you blow your cover accidentally.
- Storyline is stellar (again, only four hours in)
- Open world, feels more like an RPG, there are multiple ways to progress and multiple requirements for those progressions
- There's a decent amount to do, one minute you can be driving to the story mission, then you'll find an enemy settlement where you can steal helicopters, intel etc for personal progression.
- Game on Ultra, along with the general scenary looks beautiful.
- Unidad officers make this game a ♥♥♥♥♥ at times. (Yes, I find this a pro, makes the game more difficult, and the cop system is more intellegent).
- Map is pretty massive. 

Cons: 

- Optimization is good, but there's a lot left to desire. Nvidia still haven't released drivers for this game as of yet.
- Gameplay, a lot of the story is grab intel, go in there kill a few guys. I can feel this overtime getting repetitive, however as of now I'm still enjoying it.
- There's no real penalty for dying.
- Could potentially cause an issue with people with a lower spec PC. I'm running a I7 6700K, 16GB DDR4 2666MHz, GTX 1060 rig. However CPU usage on the game alone is 30%ish, I'm currently using 60% RAM (however I do have chrome and multiple tabs) and I'm running it smoothly 60FPS on very high. Ultra is a no no. 

However, overall. This game is good."

												Arma meets the Division.

ok, so people seem to be somehow offended by Wildlands being compared to Arma rather than MGS V. So, I'll break it down for the people that don't quite understand the comparison. 

First The Division: The entire game is built around the concept of gun and armor sets that are increasingly more powerful with level and rarity, in addition to providing the player with bonuses, all to use against increasingly more powerful enemies. This is a mechanic and system that you don't see anywhere in Wildlands. However, as far as the controls, teamplay, and general feel of both games, they do FEEL similar (Gee, can't imagine why). Two games FEELING similar does not make them alike anymore than Mario and Megaman could be compared because they were sidescrollers with similar controls. Aside from the feel of the games and what was already listed, The Division and Wildlands don't have much in common. 

Arma: Arma is an open map with bullet physics, air/land/sea vehicles, and teamplay that allows for multiple approaches to attacking various groups of enemies, facilities, and towns. Do I REALLY have to point out the similarities between the mechanics of Arma and the Mechanics of Wildlands here?

So, take the mechanics of Arma and mesh it with the feel and style of The Division, you definately have something much like Wildlands. 

MGS V: I see where people are getting the comparison to MGS V. However, MGS V doesn't have air or sea vehicles (that you pilor freely). The map is restricting in the sense that, while it is open, every road leads to Rome. What I mean by that is the map is more like a grid of roads that all go to the same places. You can't climb to the tops of mountains if you wanted because most of the mountains are used as the games walls and bounderies. You have to call in a helicopter flown by an NPC to get any kind of airtime and it's low flying and not a significant part of the game mechanics like it is in Wildlands. In MGS V you CAN be far more creative with the way you approach things. From using a box to hide, to moving bodies and throwing them in dumpsters, to using a F'ing cybernetic rocket fist etc. It has a level goofy in the gameplay you won't find in Wildlands. So, while there are similarities between MGS V and Wildlands, they aren't any more alike than any other open world sandbox military shooter.

Hense the review. Arma has Wildands mechanics and The Division has Wildlands feel. Wildlands = Arma meets The Division."

												While the game touts it's featured Co-op gameplay, a sizable portion of complaints on Ubisoft's own forums reinforce that not all players will be able to enjoy it. If you experienced the error of Tarjita-00100 during beta play allow me to save your time and money by letting you know that it has not been fixed, nor has Ubisoft even found a solution to it.

The Tarjita-00100 error is related to your network setup and characterized by the in-game setting of ""Nat Type: Offline"". Ubisoft's support staff's only reccomendation to resolve the issue is to forward ports, which does not actually resolve the issue at all. If you purchase the game and start getting the Tarjita-00100 error spare yourself the frustration and just put in your request for a refund.

Additional Edit: For anyone who is having network issues, the following steam guide can help you in attempts to troubleshoot them. In my own attempts none of the solutions worked, but everyone's setup is different.

												I recommend this game to anyone!

I cant find fault in it so far. I played the betas and covered the entire playable area. Performance has increased a bit since then. I'm able to get a solid 50 fps on High with my gtx780, cant wait to upgrade for even better perfomance.

The only thing so far that i would say needs to be changed is that when you are in a party of players, is that the resources tagged is done for he entire party and not each individuel tagging the same crate over."

												Really fun open world millitary shooter. Lots of bugs and glitches but thats expected for a game of this size still in the first week of its release (although it would be nice if they can be fixed asap because some bugs are game breaking) luckily the game autosaves pretty well so you don't lose progress. Game is also a little repetative but it's fun so doesn't really bother me. Anyway, the game has a huge map with different terrains, lots of missions and side missions, graphics are amazing, and co-op can be fun if you're playing with friends. Vehicle controls are a little weird but easy to get used to. This game really reminds me of the Just Cause series, so if you're into that game you will defiantly like this one. Overall it's a great game with lots of hours of gameplay (about 16 hours in so far and Im probably at about 5% progress) and will keep you playing for hours on end. Highly recommend"

												This game is the best game this far into year 2017. Just what I were hoping for and even abit better!

But first lets talk about what most people expect when given a Tom Clancy and more presice Ghost Recon Game. The Tom Clancy name when attached to games began way back in the days with Rainbow Six Series. It started out with a briliant FPS tactical shooter. And held iself true to it's form for quite awhile. The same can be said about the more open leveled and military focused Ghost Recon games, Though they survived the first evolution into modern days. With a more future soldier(near future that is) focus. The Rainbow six series went from a highly tactical series, into a more action oriented experience. And lately the Ghost Recon Series have passed into the open world genere....

The thing is that this has not been a great secret, and the Open Beta gave anyone the opportunity to look at the different aspects of the game. So noone should be suprised here....


For me this game can be summed up like this: It's not deep, but i'ts a hell of a fun game.  To quote Hot Shots 2.. War It's fantastic! IN other words this is a game that makes you feel like a-team or some other epic action movie`series dudes.

Yes the game have some funny physics regarding cars, the steering of helicopters, boats and car/bikes feels abit not true. But Then again this is not a Military/rally/life sim. It's an open world game where the main focus is fights!

So what about fights you say? Well, if you do everything well, every engagement is easy, but one slipup and you feel it. This is especially noticable in Coop, as in singleplayer you will always be revived(once pr battle) by NPC teamates.

The game has some briliant solutions, the syncronized shot ability is awsome in singleplayer, and in coop you use it to mark  primary targets(atleast my regular playergroup does so). And it works fine. 

Weapons, yes you must locate end pick new weapons(and weapon attachments) up at differnet locations, but you uncover these places by sheer luck or finding intel. ANd the weapon customizer is awsome!

Story: Well Ecil drug dudes, pressure Bolivia to ignore them, and weeho enter America(!) special forces.. Time to make a cleanup on line 9.....

Works well as a background thing for your wild moviestyle action! 


Graphics, stunningly beautiful landscape, Now I wish to travel to south america again. Nice weather effects, and sun+mountains+ some fog and clouds are just worth screenshots!


All in all 8.5 out of 10. Game is a good Far Cry meets Just Cause kinda game, but carves it's own slice of the Openworld cake!
(better vehicle handling would put it up to a 9 out of 10)"

												Better graphics than the beta. Recommend playing on Advanced or higher difficulty. Game is nothing like the Division, Wildlands is more realistic. A couple shots from AI and youre dead and well placed shots on AI and they are dead. Really need to play tactically to complete missions because run and gun on hard or higher mode will get you killed quick."

Yes there are still some signature Ubisoft micro transactions, however the game is great.
The game needs a bit more activities because the world does feel a bit empty.
Also HQ upgrades like in Metal Gear Solid PP would be a nice edition."

												This game is a solid 8/10 with the potential to be a 9/10. I enjoy the dialogue between the ghosts...makes you feel like a squad. I'm only able to run this on medium (until I get a better GPU) and it looks pretty fine; Not great but okay.  Gameplay makes me feel like GTA/Farcry, go figure, right? At the moment I've only put in +10 hours and I'm playing solo so I can't imagine the gameplay with a squad. So official decision is......if you're hyped for this and willing to pay $60 then go for it if not wait until it goes on sale."

												Hey! It's not a bad PC port for once!
Pros:Runs smoothly 
Gun customization
Derpy physics and AI
Large map (JC 3 larger though)
Beautiful landscape
Cons:Derpy physics and AI
Mediocre vehicle handling at best
No real special storyline
No real dialogue (both story and in game AI)
Singleplayer is kind of sad 
Some character customization needs more variety (ex: hair styles)
Notes and Thoughts:Although this game may not be for everyone, I think its okay. Mostly because I got it for free ;). However, if you really like open world sandbox play and all of your friends have this game, it might be worth it to drop some dollars and download 52GB of co-op derpiness. Personally, I thought there might have been more issues the day of launch (9PM PST for me) but I didn't encounter any. If you're still not sure, you might just wait for a sale on this game. ITS DIFFERENT FROM GRAW!!

												Pros:
Beautiful game, huge map (I forget that there must be a boundary somewhere). 
Lot's of non-linear play, I was flying to a mission and saw a plane shot down (nothing to do with me). I went to investigate, found supplies to mark, and a lead for a whole list of side missions.
Makes me want to play multiplayer.  I'm a die hard single player gamer, and I'm already (after 3 hours) excited to join some co-op groups this weekend.

Con:
AI overall is good, but I'd like to see more tactics from enemies.
There is no reason not to just drive like a maniac from point to point, I'd like my actions to possibly draw attention?  Raise my profile (maybe unidad sends a patrol to check on the pickup that went crashing through the jungle)

I can easily see this game being my go to shooter for quite some time."

												Das Spiel ist wie ich es mir vorgestellt habe. Keine Probleme beim Dowmload, und beim Start.  Die Performance vom Spiel ist wie auch schon in der Beta, schwankend. Mal hat man gute FPS, doch bei viel bewegung und viel Kampf, eher nur um die 45-50 FPS.

Spiel sieht alles in allem aber Wundervoll aus und es fühlt sich -anders als bei anderen Spielen- Vollständig und fertig an. Das Waffenhandling ist 1A. Das einzige kleine Manko das ich habe, ist die Fahrzeugsteuerung. Für meinen Geschmak ein bisschen zu Empfindlich was das Fahren mit Bodenfahrzeugen angehtz. Beim Fliegen mit Luftzfahrzeugen geht es einigermaßen. Das ist aber Meckern auf hohen Nivaue. Die modifikation der Waffen und die charakter custimasation gefallen  mir richtig gut, da hier jeder etwas findet, was Ihm gefällt. Hier hat Ubisoft also mal richtig gute Arbeit geleistet. 

Ich hoffe aber noch das ein bis zwei patches veröffentlich werden die meine performance etwas in die höhe schrauben. 

Noch kurz zu meinem System. 
Ich spiele mit einer GTX 980 Ti OC Strix mit 6GB
einen i7 6700K mit 4GHz
und 32 GB RAM

DIeses Spiel ist für alle empfehlenswert die auf eine Große, wunderschön anzusehende offene Welt, mit viel Missions Content stehen, und die es lieben, alles zu looten was es so auf der großen Spielkarte zu holen gibt."

I was experiencing autosave stuttering. (dreaded skull in bottom right corner) 

HOWEVER, i can confirm switching JUST UPLAY ITSELF to an SSD fixed this issue for me.

Im not about to throw a 50 Gb game onto my SSd just yet, but if any issues arise from having game on HD, and Uplay on SSD i will update :)"

												this game has high (exclusively high) graphics requirements, but its so much fun im playing through the lag as best i can.

this game said fun and it delivered. the only thing im worried about is the fact that i mysteriously went from 08 to 30 in a second for no reason at all (i cannot figure it out why all i was doin was flyin from itacua to montuyoc and stopped at a rebel op and shot everybody even the guy by mistake then while i was attaching a new attachment i noticed level thirty and 64 new skill points), i may have a 5% infinite XP booster but that wouldn't have done that. 

i very highly recommend this game (even if you might not be able to run it on low) as this game just made the rest of my year)

(Edit 2:22 AM 2/8/2017)

Finally ad a chance to fly over the land, really mind blowing how much detail they put into this. Smoothest part of the game for me so far. at this point i still haven't really seen ♥♥♥♥ and i gotta say its impressively made (i'd play it just to see what the place looks like again).  how ever flying controls are highly counter intuitive and landing helicopters with a keyboard basically (when not used to it at all) is like an 80/20 raffle where 80 is for crashing and 20 is for rough landing. how ever if you get the hang of the down key you can land it like a dainty little butterfly."

												This is my first review on Steam. I find this game worth to review. 

My caveat, the game is not for everyone even you enjoy gta v or mgsv. Because it is neither of them. Stealth and action is well packed and tactical elements are not punishing and demanding as mgsv. Vast open world may get repetitive if you do not like to hang around. Likewise if you are really  into story you might not like the fiction. Do not expect a Witcher or a Snake from this game. 

That being said I don't agree to people  saying that single  player is a boredom. Think that this is like a nice well made action movie comparing Russian movies. If you are for reality, hardcore gaming go to Dark Souls or Arma. Just have fun and don't think the rest. 

Gameplay is extremely fun. Gun play is smooth, action is well paced.There  are some glitches here and there but that's all. Musics are enjoyable. A nice Breaking Bad moment can be experienced in Bolivia. To be honest car physics are sometimes clunky but as far as I read from the first reviews  this issue will be fixed soon. Even now it is not a disaster. 

I experience fps drops with a rig 16 gb ram, i7 4790k 
and gtx 1060 on ultra settings. I can say that Deus Ev mankind divided runs like a charm on ultra high with the same rig. 

There's one thing I do not like. If you are not satisfied with a mission and your cover is blown you do not have to wait to die for restarting. This is really disturbing. But maybe I am missing something. Checkpoints should be enabled somewhere. 

To sum up if you like Splinter Cell and Ghosts Future Soldier with open world experience do buy it. 

If you are into hardcore gaming experience with a detailed characterisation be aware of it. 

My points

Gameplay: 10/9
Graphics: 10/11
Ambience: 10/10
Voice acting: 10/8
Sounds and music: 10/9
Story: 10/6
Characterisation: 10/7
Physics: 10/9


Thanks."

												Honestly this game is fun the first 15 hours after that you feel that all missions are just the same. The thing though lately with ubisoft is that all there games feel like copy pasta with a different skin.

Just can't push myself to finish this game just like Far cry Primal.

The story line lately of ubisoft feels like it's made by a suicidal 14 year old teen. No emotion, no logic, just chaos and repetitive missions.

Thanks ubisoft but i won't buy anymore of your games."

												Short version:
This feels like the Sonic 06 of the Tom Clancy franchise.
So borderline unplayable yet at the same time a lot of fun to co-op.
The physics and graphical issues should not be a feature.
+ Fun with friends or allies. It's like a game of pickup sticks, but with guns.
+ Sniping. That feeling when hearing that hit mark on a 700m+ shot.
- Everything else. AI, Vehicles, Terrain, Missions, Controls all in varied stages of bugging out, stopping working or breaking in some manner.

RANT AHEAD:
The controls frequently glitch out preventing drone or binocular use. While maybe not controls directly, my character has in every session at some point given up on snapping to cover preventing peaking. Whole game has to be closed down and restarted to fix.

AI is overpowered, dumb or glitchy half the time, spotting you through walls or while directly behind them; enemys spawn in less than 300m from you, including attack helecopters which can then spot you. If 1 enemy spots you, even if you kill them the moment they do before they can react. EVERYONE EVERYWHERE knows your EXACT location. EVEN IF YOU ARENT DETECTED but the enemy is on alert, a silenced kill somehow makes everyone search the location you shot from even if no-one witnessed the shot or the kill.

The pop in is painful and often blocks shots you can't tell are being blocked by non-existent objects. I also feel like since the last patch the pop in got worse?

The alerts are stupid because its not like, oh they've called in support from another base; no just 3 fully loaded vehicles appear instantly at the front gate or quite possibly on the road that just so happens to be directly behind where you were sniping from which was 400m away from the base itself.

This list could go on. Missing out on various mission glitches, the rediculous rebel AI and such but this is enough for starters."

												This is the kind of military shooter I've been waiting for: large in scope similar to Arma, but with much easier access and controls. You are free to roam Bolivia and take down the Santa Blanca drug cartel by dismantling its operations in various regions. You will assault bases and outposts, and do side missions for extra resources. You have a good amount of weapons and accessories at your disposal, which need to be unlocked. However, the starting weapons are more than adequate for some good hunting. There's a good amount of clothing and tactical gear options and accessories for you to play around with, each item comes with different colors and/or camo patterns. Can change outfits on the fly any time by going into your inventory. Day/night cycle, and changing weather patterns. Graphics are really nice! Fun times either solo or co-op, but definitely much more fun in co-op, duh!"

												Ghost Recon Wildlands is a very entertaining open world game with lots of large beautiful environments to explore.

----- Great gameplay, the gun handling and shooting are very solid and feel real good. Your character seems to run, move, duck etc. all with no problem. There is no jump or cover system in this game however it doesn't seem to be an issue as the character model will hug the wall when crouched and leaning against it and the ""vault"" option allows you to jump over/climb objects in front of you.

The Driving isn't a big issue as many have claimed. It's certainly different than similar open world games, however once you learn how to drive/fly it’s very easy. I actually prefer Ghost Recon Wildlands vehicle mechanics over most other games.


----- The graphics of this game are defiantly above average however the environments are top notch and very beautiful. I was also impressed at the level of detail to the weapons and how the weather looked in this game. The rain pouring down and how your character looks soaked or while you’re out in the snow and the snow is accumulating on your characters hat. All of those minor details make a huge difference.

*** Bonus to graphics - I also really enjoyed the graphic settings option in this game. When changing a setting in graphics menu the game has a very cool image displayed on the right showing you exactly what the function you’re adjusting will change in game. Example: Switching texture quality from Low to Medium, High or Ultra really does show the graphical progression. The game will show you exactly on every setting what it does and how it will look after adjusted. I wish more games would do this as good as Ghost Recon Wildlands does.


----- The missions are all very unique and can pose a true challenge when played at higher difficulty. Everyone plays differently and this game successfully allows users to go in guns blazing or quietly take out the objective. Each zone is comprised of 5-6 missions and seem to have their own little story. This allows users to drop in and out of friend’s games and play together while not disrupting their own story progression. You can simply just start a new zone together and continue to progress together.
Some of the missions can be a little weak or easy no matter the difficulty. Example: some missions are simply just go and locate someone to talk to them. However, they do not repeat, the game really doesn’t have any repetitive mission format at all. I personally took notes of the very fun missions while playing in order to replay them later on.


----- Character progression was done well in this game. Without a “leveling up to become more powerful system”. Ghost Recon Wildlands allows users to simply just find items to unlock while playing and leveling. More weapons and levels do not make players of higher levels 'stronger' it just means they have found different weapons or unlocked gadgets and such like night vision. 

The plus side to all these new weapons and attachments is that they all seem to be pretty balanced. I'm able to run through every mission using the assault rifle you’re giving at the start of the game and it wasn't any additional challenge. I also really enjoyed how the game never was a grind of gear. A large portion of the gear can be discovered and collected while you play through the story. 

Character progression does stop at level 30 as right now it’s the level cap. I’m not sure why they capped the leveling but at 30 I did feel less incentivized to do as much as I was before since I was no longer getting XP. Even if they didn’t supply a skill point for leveling up or give you anything. Allowing players to keep leveling up would be a fine incentive to continually play and level.


----- The story line of Ghost Recon Wildlands isn’t anything too special or unique. I mean, you’re just another “Super Duper Ultra Top Secret Elite Task Force sent in to do whatever is needed by the U.S. Govt.” I’m pretty sure we’ve all played many games like this and it’s a core theme ripped from a plethora of movies. However, it does have its moments where it shines, the ending was done very well as it does set up the DLCs and explain some cool story line stuff. For those seeking a huge rich/deep story, there isn’t much that Ghost Recon Wildlands is going to supply but if you can watch an average cheap action movie and enjoy it than Ghost Recon Wildlands will be an entertaining storyline. It’s worth paying attention to, however missing a cut scene here or there isn’t the end of the world.


----- The endgame and replayability is very similar to any other campaign based game. You get to replay the story and try different techniques to complete the missions. At the moment there isn’t a horde mode or anything like that, however there seems to be a lot of open world type things to do after you’ve completed the game. Like any other open world game, you can run around and collect all the lootables, complete the never ending side missions, try to stop random convoys that are around the map, steal supplies and return them to the rebels or simply just run around doing, whatever you want.


----- Overall it deserves the $60 and worth playing. I’d most defiantly recommend the game as it’s proving to be a positive release for Ubisoft. The game has a lot to do with a huge open world that is incredibly drawn up. Each zone looks so amazing and I have found myself just exploring random caves, mountains, forests only to find some very amazing things. The story alone is around 40-50 hours of gameplay if done at an average speed. I’m sure it can be done quicker but I do enjoy the story of a good game so I ended up playing pretty slow, but took the time to play very efficient. 

-----Here are some quick tips that helped me through the game;
Since weapons/attachments/Kingslayer files/Intel are practically on the path of the story missions. I’d recommend simply just playing the story mode and not worrying about collecting everything. I played by selecting a zone and focusing on the story missions in order then going to the next zone and running those story missions over and over. This kept the game interesting as the story missions do not repeat. After you’ve completed the story go back if you want to pick up the collectables you’ve missed. Since doing the story will allow you to pick up most of the collectables, doing it the other way around would make you back track and run in circles. - After I had killed the final boss I had realized I picked up more than half the collectables on the map.[/]

Skill points and medals seem to be the biggest lootables that are not on the path of the story; those are worth going a little out of your way to collect

Do NOT rush the end boss. I don't care how fast you complete the game, however it's worth it to go after El Sueno only after you have 100% all the other story missions. You don't need to have all the lootables collected but make sure each zones story is completed. (I won’t ruin/spoil anything however, it’s much better when you kill El Sueno if you have 100% the zones than if you hadn’t)

Play on elite difficulty. The game can be pretty easy playing on lower difficulty, especially after you've been playing on elite for a while. At first it may be too hard on elite, force yourself to adapt and you will end up enjoying the game more.

Take notes on your favorite missions in order to remember which ones to replay after you complete the game."

												- Good mashup between The Division, Far Cry and Just cause.
- FPS mechanics like Far Cry 3 or 4
- 3rd Person mechanics similiar to The divison
- And a litte insanity like Just cause
- Driving is ok, from my POV there is lil room to improve
- Flying the chopper is a lil strange, but you get use to it fast and then it's somooth and easy.

Recommendation:
- Put difficulty to hardest or 2nd hardest stage and remove some of the HUD elements
- Play with friends in COOP"

												Ghost Recon has been a long time favorite of mine since the beginning.  The complexity and the care and attention was what made the game amazing.  This, not so much as the orginal, but new concept and still incredible.  It is a different gaming experience, but when the difficulty is cranked up, that old feeling of holy ♥♥♥♥♥ comes back quick.

I have not had the chance to delve days and days yet, but after running the first few objectives I can honestly say when the kids are in bed, the head phones go on, and I travel to Bolivia with friends, and we make a mess.

I have also read a lot about performance, i did have some issues at first in Ultra, so I knocked it done to Very High and went custom everything back up to full except Texture, and shut down Vert Sync and restarted the game and it really is nice.  Maybe some drivers in the next little while for those suffering, time will tell."

												Simply put, the potential is there, but the game is flawed, often making it unplayable. One of these flaws is the cover system, which allows the player to simply bump up against a wall or building and go into cover, which in theory could have been something good, something that added to the game; and yet it does little to that effect, often being unreliable and clunky, with the cover ofent doing little to protect against opponents. A second slightly minor flaw is the shoulder switching, allowing you to switch between right and left shoulders. This is often useful, actually adding to the gameplay, by allowing you to round corners with lime of sight and such, but when entering or exiting cover, the game has a tendency to pick a side at random, often leaving you aiming into walls or away from the target.
The third is the respawns, which are mildly odd at best and brain numbingly stupid at worst, and you may say 'if you where good, you wouldnt need to respawn', well im pretty ♥♥♥♥, so i need to respwan alot.
And lastly, the thing that makes me not want to recommend this game, is the AI, both enemy and friendly/ally. the enemy AI has one form of engagement, 2 if you count snipers and helicopters, to slowly or rapidly rush towards the player, often in groups  of 3-4, though sometimes more. the second is snipers and helicopters, oppting to try to snipe you from their nests. This leads to the player simply needing to herd the AI into a funnel and to then mow them down, like the brain dead beings they sometimes resemble. The ally AI is no better, with 'protect' missions being RNG ♥♥♥♥fests, as to whether the vip runs into enemy fire or takes cover, or simply getting one-shotted, failing the mission, and having to restart. 

Although I have been negative through out, if you have 3 friends, and dont mind the odd/erratic AI then i would recommend this to you. though i really think ubi need to up their game on missions types and optimization, i had fun for a while atleast."

												At fisrt i thought oh no another open world game from ubisoftt, but then I started playing a bit just to see how the gameplay feels like, and its actually farely decent, they still have much work to put in regarding vehicle controls, but otherwise everything is great, you get tons of tweaks for the graphic settings, the game even lets you run benchmark for your own custom graphic options, and speaking of customization, holy ♥♥♥♥ does this game have it, obviously you dont get crazy character customizations option like an elderscroll game, but the amount of clothes, gears, gun parts you can tweak to your liking is absolutely fantastic.

I recommend this game to people who likes open world and third person shooters, i dont recommend this game to people who wants a great story or FPS fans, it's really different from what you might expect, but overall i have a blast playing it."

												I wasnt really expecting much when i heard about this game, so my expecations for this game were very low. And so when i started to play this game i was suprised at what it offered. The optimzation for this game is alright. This game is really what i wanted, a chill game to pick up and shoot some mexicans. The game mechanics are eazy to get use to like the over sensitive veehicles or the awkard flying but after awhile u will get use to it. Thia game is clearly not for everyone its like if farcry has sex with the divison and gtav. All in all its a fun a entertaining game and i would recommend this to anyone that wants a casual/arcade type shooter to play with some friends. I would rate it a 7/10"

												Played the game three seperate times before release and i saw lots of progression with fixing bugs and optimization.
If i ever had any complaints about the gameplay, It's Unidad, They are just a faction that either offer a challenge or just chew through your team.

As far as the game runs, I witness microstutters but they don't last long.
Game locks up for half a second every now and then.
Game still needs some more love.

Also on a side note, Even though i made a promise to a friend to wait for him before doing the story,
I still feel overwhelmed by how massive the map is and how much of the map is alive at any given time"

												Oh you better be prepared for one of the most beautifully rendered games I've ever seen games i've ever played. I'm so gladi finally joined the PC Nation. There are a few issues but small ones like, while playing around in this spectacularly massive open world, while driving my 1st vehicle I noticed that you dont leave your own tracks in the mud. And it would really have been awesome if you could individually control your team. it's kind of annoying when you cant set each of your team around an objective so you can coordinate your attack better. I've had quite a few times where my guys aren't so bright and get seen while making their way to thei waypoint.  Also my 1st game in 4k and it was worth it, its like playing a movie...literally it looks that awesome! so much detail i was so...in AWE that i didn't even play for the 1st hour and change i walked and drove around checking out the beautiful views, And configuring my system to run ultra settings on 1 EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 SC at between 40 to 60 fps. This game takes alot to run. I heard from some ""professionals"" that it looks better to run a game on 1080p at ultra settings, than 4k on very high, or even high. Those men, are either BLIND! Or they...I don't actually know why else they would say it looks better at 1080p, it just doesn't...I just need to find a group of players that wants to play like i do...Tactically silent. And coordinate our shots so we are in and out and we leave only corpses behind. Apparently there's alot more players that wanna go in balls deep, than a coordinated attack. i highly recommend this game for sure. 120%. This will be my go to game for a while"

												I love this game.

This game is my favourite game right now because of the open world atmosphere, the map size and just ♥♥♥♥ing around with friends.

Now, the story in this game isn't very good. It doesn't have any emotional bond or hatered towards characters and you never get any backstory of any characters other than El Sueno in the first cutscene of the game.

But the bugs in this game and the missions you can do and the basic functions of the game make playing this the best game ever. There isn't any paid content that gives you a PvP (for when it's released) boost, like Ubisoft does, unless you count weapon and attachment packs which can all be unlocked in the game.

Anyways, I give this a thumbs up, good work Ubisoft."

												This game is great. Some troubles here and there but great to play as a casual gamer. The solo mode works very well for me. I did not receive any major crashes yet (two occurred within 23h of gameplay).
What I really need to get used to is the control of the planes and helicopters. At the moment, this is a pain for me.
Overall, I really recommend this game and look forward to further improvements / patches. E.g. also new mission types ;)

One big issue is the fact of missing features with the ATI graphics card. Screenshots are nice, but creating a high-resolution panorama view (with set graphic settings or even better) would be a great benefit because the created landscapes is really perfect. I read that this works on Nvidia graphics cards but to be honest this is not worth it to buy a new graphic card. So please include this for ATI as well!

Looks like I still have some hours to play until I'm through ;)"

												GO TO THE BOTTOM FOR TL;DR 


THE VERY GOOD

- This game starts off really fun for the first ten or so hours.

- Lots of beautiful, varied environments that are pretty fun to explore.

- Pretty big variety of weapons to choose from (Granted, some are a lot better than others)

- Beautiful looking game, provided your computer can handle the higher settings.


THE GOOD

- Gunplay is pretty sound. Only complaint is that shooting from 3rd person is a bit wonky.

- Most of the underboss/operation head missions are a lot of fun. 

- The map is probably one of the largest in any game, and the stuff to do in it is pretty well spaced out in my opinion.


THE MEH

- Optimization isn't terrible, but I wouldn't recommend this game for anyone that's running on a lower end rig or a laptop, because this game can be quite demanding even on the lower settings.

- The story missions for the buchons are either a hit or a miss, some can be pretty unique while others are just pretty basic tasks that are basically the same as some side missions.


THE BAD

-The physics in this game aren't terribly good, and can even be game-breaking if you're unlucky enough.

- The game does very little to attempt to immerse you in the world. The narrative is mainly told through optional videos and documents that you can pick up at your discretion.

- This might be expected on launch, but there are WAY too many bugs and glitches that negatively impact the experience. (Especially in multiplayer) Thankfully, the devs have been pretty good about hammering out the existing bugs and most of the more game-breaking ones should get patched pretty soon.

- A lot of the skills are pretty generic stat boosts, with the exception of those that give you new gear. 

- With the exception of the main antagonist, the voice acting is pretty terrible. Not necessarily a big part of the game, but still pretty bad nonetheless.

- As is to probably be expected, this game's AI is pretty bad, which is why I would recommend doing multiplayer as opposed to singleplayer. Some of the AI teammates will even shoot at objectives that you need to keep intact/alive.


THE VERY BAD

- The story of this game is pretty terrible. There are way too many untouched plot points and there are very few characters that do anything to drive the narrative of the story. The buchons and the protagonists are very generic and there's really nothing in the game that makes you want to explore the story any more.

- Some of the character animations are noticably weird. Some of the more egregious examples of this are during the opening cutscenes and the interrogation cutscenes.

- After the first 10 hours the game really starts to run out of steam. Doing the side missions gets really tedious and once you get to the late game there's nothing to incentivize you from doing them any more. With the exception of the more important ones, the story missions get increasingly more monotonous.

- (BIG STORY SPOILERS) Both of the game's endings are pretty bad. They just end up with you having to spare the main antagonist beause the idiots at the CIA say ""muh we need to catch terrorists xd"" and the only difference is which parts of the world are screwed over.

- Excluding an increased amount of rebels, there are very few things in the game that change one you start to dismantle the cartel. While at face value this isn't bad, it really discourages you from actually progressing in the game because your actions really don't have effects.

TL;DR

I wouldn't recommend this game unless you have a bunch of frends who have it and want to play it or if this thing goes on sale. I don't regret purchasing this game, but for a AAA title it has way too many shortcomings. Definitely not a terrible game by any stretch of the imagination, but certainly not worth the $60 pricetag. Moreover, I wouldn't ever recommend this game to people with low end PCs or those who enjoy more story driven games. There are some redeeming factors for this game but the negatives definitely outweigh the postitives."

												The game doesn't feel like it got the name ""Ghost Recon"" stamped on it for the sake of name recognition like they did with Siege. That makes me really happy. It plays like a sequel to all your favorite Ghost Recon games. A little from the original Ghost Recon, Ghost Recon2, Future Soldier and Advanced Warfighter all in an open world environment. The game comes packed with all the customizations a pc gamer wants. If you don't like something, see if you can't change it. Even things like enemy markers can be turned off. The gameplay gets as tactical as you want it to be. I really enjoy this game. Thanks so much devs!"

A couple shots from AI and youre dead and well placed shots on AI and they are dead.

												                                           [IF YOU DON'T HAVE FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH DONT BUY THIS GAME ]
Ghost reacon Wildlands is a beautiful tactical shooter at it's core but lacks some serious features of a AAA standard game.
After craeting a character (Which is lame by the way, its just some random cosmetics except the cool ones locked behind paywall ). Then i joined one of my buddy in co op and played for straight 3 to 4 hours, it was fun but ..... but that's it that is the whole backbone of the game.
For me it's.
                  Graphics : HUGE map with stunning visuals, character and gun models are top notch, day night cycle with weather fx is awesome.

                   Audio & Sound fx : OKish voice acting with sub-par sound fx but i feel like every weapon has same sound almost , with a silencer its PEW PEW without it phut phut.... It is not acceptable for a tactical shooter.

                   Gameplay : It's fun but very repetative but in a good way, scout the area be stealthy or just gunblaze. The AI though are either very stupid or the game feels easy on the hardest difficulty FTW ubisoft (Yes I'm looking at The Division). Again the vast map is beautiful but feels very empty just like Just cause 3. Objectives are same from the first 3 hour , go there kill him/her , go there capture and extract intel , ton of lame fetch quest , till you face the boss , some lame guy with random tatoos on em. No character devlopment no charisma nothing pure tasteless.

                     Overall : For me it is a wait for sale because if you get it now and you dont have friends to play with then you will get bored in 3 to 4 hours ."

												Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands has to be one of my most current now recommended Tom Clancy labeled games since Splinter Cell Blacklist. It has to be the most nailed down to a T of a game I've been looking for. I was looking for a game kind of like Arma, but with more of a open world with random encounters and has a story to it, as well as it being a co-op or lone wolf feel.

Pros:
Glorious banter with friends.
Being able to shoot long distances with good bullet physics.
Decent Ai that also has good convos with each other.
Pretty cool random events such as: Supply Transports, Random helicopters flying over and them attacking the player/s.

Cons:
The occasional game freeze to load up more of the map. (for me I don't mind it.)
The chat for typing between people is a bit dodgy, such as you could be typing and it won't send and it would glitch and would spam letters instead of moving.
The stupid civs just running you over because they cannot drive for ♥♥♥♥.

Conclusion:
Overall, I have enjoyed the game and there is so much more to do because there is multiple things you can do other than just completing the story missions, infact I still have few more to do as I am writing this at roughly 60ish hours in game.
As well as playing it again with a mate or two really inpacts more of enjoyment rather than solo and rushing everything."

												This is a game that I feel like people are either going to really love, or really hate. It all just depends on what you are looking for. 

I'm enjoying this game because I can tackle a main story mission and then a side quest or two WITHOUT feeling like I absolutely have to keep playing to know how the story unfolds. It doesn't suck you in to a deep, well thought out plot/storyline, so I have the freedom to just enjoy the gameplay in my spare time without being consumed by it. If you are looking for an epic storyline, this isn't it. I'm ok with that.

I find the gameplay really entertaining. For the most part I use suppressed weapons and try and take out enemies without getting into firefights. Being ""Ghost Recon"" I feel like being sneaky and stealthy is how the game was intended to be played, but it is doable to go in guns blazing if that's your thing. There are some missions that will certainly be ""easier"" to take on in sneak-mode, but you aren't limited to playing one way or another. I'd also add that in most situations, a little bit of recon and planning is always helpful, even if you intend to drive into a group of enemies on a 4x4 with a mini gun and mow down everything that moves. Put some thought into it and work up a plan and things will go better, regardless of if you choose a commando-in-the-shadows approach or rambo-blow-up-everything style.

As I've progressed and made it to more difficult regions in the game, I've found that the objectives can be a bit repetetive (Interrogate that guy, kill that guy, steal that thing, blow up that thing, etc...) However, difficulty increases nicely and there are new challenges that come up as you're out and about taking down the cartel. There are new things like alarm towers, surface-to-air missiles, heavier armored enemies, etc. I find that it keeps the game fresh. It's pretty rewarding to level up your abilities and get access to better equipment, and take down more complex defenses. 

The AI isn't great, for either teammates or enemies. But I don't think it is awful either. There have been times that I just tell my team to ""hold position"" so I can deal with something by myself. Normally they do alright. There are times when enemies are unrealistically hard or easy, but for the most part it's ok if you set the appropriate difficulty for you. 

The world is enormous and looks fantastic. I can't say much more than that. I am running fairly high spec build so I have no issues with frame rate and detail. With an i7-5820K and GTX1070 on ultra settings I get well above 60fps in the in game benchmark (for what it's worth). 

None of my friends have yet to buy the game, so I haven't played with other humans yet, but I can imagine that would take the game to a really awesome level. I don't have much interest in doing co-op with random people I don't know so I haven't tried the matchmaking. 

My gripes thus far with the game... 

-1) The vehicles kind of suck. They are just really hard to control right. I'd say my gaming abilites are average, but it's going to require some patience or someone with above average abilities to master vehicles in this game. 

-2) Less than stellar AI

-3) The shooting from cover system is flawed. I feel like Ubisoft did the cover system really well in the Division, but it sucks in Wildlands. You get your basic ""aim to lean/peek over the top"" functionality, but most of the time it just doesn't work right in fast paced combat and it's annoying.

Overall I give the game high marks. The pro's definitely outweigh the con's for me, and I'm sure I'll get my fair share of enjoyment for the $60 I spent on the game."

- Difficulty doesn't matter Easy or Hard require same skills
- A.I. is Dumb
- Microtransactions (Damn I love Golden Vehicles bought them)
- Your Personal Vehicles can't be ordered, you have to go and get them
and they'll probably be destroyed until you reach your destination...

Future:- There will be PVP, atleast 4v4 (I hope 8v8 will be a thing)
- I don't know about whole current story but one of the dlc's will include Inside missions so these are alot different than current ones, you'll act as one of their own.
- Seasonal Events, I'm not really sure what kind of Seasonal events these will be, and if they will bring content, but I hope there will be Seasonal Events like (Halloween, Xmas etc)."

												TL;DR: If you got time to kill, why not. Otherwise, wait for sale.

First and foremost, the game isn't broken. So it comes down to whether this game suits your taste or not.While I think the game is over-all well made, in its current state I see three main issues:

1. Controls: This is especially true for vehicles. Cars feel like they are driving on wet or icy road, even when driving on blacktar. Generally, from my limited experience, it seems all surfaces behave almost identical in regards to friction. Further the speed control with keyboard and mouse is as unimaginative as ever. Why not have a speed cap or gears so you can drive slowly while holding down ""W""? Just use the same buttons helicopters use for altitude. Speaking of the devil: Why reinvent the wheel? Helicopter controls have been done very well by games such as Battlefield. Just copy that and there you go. The current controls simply hamper your agility too much and hold you by the hand. 
But these issues aren't exclusive to vehicles. The other biggy for me is how the game handles cover: If the game detects a wall, the character will lean up against it, but as a player you have no direct control over it, as you would have in ""the Division"". So due to its 3rd person nature you lack the exact positioning of a FPS, but there isn't a traditional cover system to compensate, often leaving you exposed and taking quite the bullets. Also, don't try to shoot down form a tower at steep angles. Your guy will just aim into the cover instead of over it past a certain angle(~45°). The whole cover thing kind of leads into the next point...

2. A.I. The A.I. is quite limited to say the least. Mostly in their intellect. I had to interrogate a commander in an UNIDAD base with around 15 enemies, apparently all highly trained soldiers. The base had 3 snipers overlooking the surrounding area. So how do I get close to this base without getting detected?  Shoot the snipers from ~100 meters with an unsupressed M40A5 and have noone in the base giving a ♥♥♥♥. That on 2nd highest difficulty? Basically, if the A.I. doesn't have LoS on the bodies and aren't right next to you when you fire they don't seem to notice. Bullet impacts and soundwaves apparently don't exist. This kind of makes stealth quite easy. 
So how's rambo style? Well, due to the previously described cover system, or lack thereof, you either get shot because of overwhelming numbers, or you easily win the fight. Basically, your skill(besides aim) doesn't matter too much. You can't ""outplay"" the A.I. by using superior cover, fire and movment, suppression, etc. There's simply no depth to the combat. And the A.I. doesn't seem to get smarter. With higher difficulty they just do more damage and take more of it by what I can tell.

3. Lack of character. This goes for the main protagonists and antagonists, as well as the missions. ""the Witcher 3"" is one of my favorite games because the world feels so alive. And because even the side-missions were well crafted and it felt like you actually interacted with the world around you. While this game has an amazingly large and beautiful world, it still feels so empty. The missions are the same basic ""fetch this, capture this guy, hold this position, etc"". Hence I fear this game will quickly become very repetetive. 

And I think it's a great shame. The gunplay feels rewarding, the customization is if anything quite over the top, allowing you to change parts to your heart's content. And did I mention how beautiful the world is? It looks gorgeous. But I fear that none of that will keep me interested in the long run. And so here I am debating whether to keep going or to refund it. This game is certanily worth something. But 60$, plus having to deal with microtransactions? 

Honestly, you are probably best of waiting for a sale. But at least the servers seem do to well and the launch was good. So good on you, Ubisoft. Lets keep going from there and maybe they can fix my concerns with post-launch updates.

EDIT: To clarify: I'm certain this game can be great fun with friends. But at this prize? ""Sniper elite: Zombie army"" is great fun with friends, and is cheap as hell. But if a game is only fun with friends you will often find yourself with no friends playing it. Because you'll only play when they are online, so you have to arrange it. Leaving me with my previous conclusion: The game in its current state probably won't keep me interested on the SP alone, because of which I recommend waiting for a sale."

												After roughly 4 hours i can tell you that from what ive seen its a great game. Nice open world, different weapons, good looking terrain, etc. It reminds me a bit of Far Cry 4, mainly because of how you access missions, which you do by going to its location on the map. Only problem is that in the beginning when you were creating you character it took a long time to load everytime you tried looking at a new face (for me idk if anyone else had that problem). Great game so far"

												Great game to play! There are pros and cons when it comes to playing, however.

Pros:
Runs very smoothly
Graphics look great and are adjustable to your preference
The Multiplayer/Co-op option for this game works great, and it's fun to play with other people
What I also noticed about playing online is that the game pairs you up with players closer within your location/city. From personal experience of playing on the Open Beta as well as the official release, which I think is neat
The difficulty settings are set up nicely for people who want an easy gameplay experience or for those who really want to challenge themselves in extremely tactical battles and missions

Cons:
This game takes up a lot of disk space; about 40gb
It does not run well on everybody's computer based on the specifications you guys have, which is a big downfall because this game requires a very good system to run on, whether it is PC or laptop based, and that's not something that everybody can financially afford
The controls for the transportation for vehicles and aircraft (ie. helicopter) are only somewhat decent. I have played games with better movement controls than this
The cash shop is somewhat of a cheat because you can buy items there without going through the struggle of unlocking it through general gameplay (solo or multiplayer campaign), which kind of loses its purpose of making it a more challenging game

I have so far not experienced any sort of issues with the games yet in terms of bugs or other technical errors, but hopefully that is something that can be reportable and without difficulty to pass through to the service.

Overall rating is 8/10"

- good controlls

the bad things maybe come down to Vehicle controll and bugs they dont feel very good and are like rubber and glued to the ground.

the quest design could be repetetive but for me its not a big issue but it is an actuall issue!

All in all i would recommend it if you like Coop games!"

												Upon the first 30 minutes of gameplay, I witnessed multiple glitches involving disappearing characters and randomized stuttering. The game feels poorly optimized and unpolished at best. Games which look much better (such as Battlefield 1) will hit upwards of 100 FPS on the highest settings on my system, this game struggled to stay above 40. Overall, I cannot justify paying $80, $90 or $120 CDN for this title just yet, as there is quite a bit of patchwork needed before the game can truly be enjoyed. It's a great idea, and a great concept, but at this time, poorly optimzied and poorly executed. Hopefully in a couple months time, the situation will have improved. Until then, I'll say this: Buyer beware. If you expect to run this on Ultra without a multi-thousand dollar system, you're sorely mistaken. Even with a high-spec system, expect stuttering, glitching, frame rate drops and even sporadic crashes."

												I'm 23 hours into this game, 95% of which has been single player, and here's my review

FAR CRY 4 LITE or FAR CRY 4 For Dummies!

And Im not saying this as a negative.  Far Cry 4 was my favorite open world ""conquer the map"" type single player game.

So calling Ghost Recon Wildlands Far Cry 4 Lite or Far Cry 4 For Dummies isn't an insult.

The gun play feels much more simplified / arcade type than Far Cry 4's shooting mechanics.  Obviouisly I was not expecting ARMA shooting out of this game, but I think the devs went a bit too far toward the ""simple"" side.  Example, your AI teammates (again, ive been playing 95% single player) can mark and kill targets that they have no line of sight to.  You mark up to 3 x targets  using your binoculars, and wait about 15 seconds while the AI says its ""getting into position"" (which they really aren't, since they dont need a line of site to kill them), and then hold down Q and the 3 targets are instantly killed, 100% of the time.  Doing this I have seen many times where my AI squadmate shot the target through a solid concrete building :/  

You don't need any of the stealth play either.  While it was fun in the beginning, now Im just trying to finish the game quickly.  You can speed into nearly any enemy outpost, bail out of the car with your un-silenced M249 SAW and clear the place out.  

Tl, dr:
+Fun conquer the map type single player campaign
+large selection of guns for gun nuts
+great graphics

-shooting feels too arcade like / simple
-after a while, it feels like you are doing the same thing over and over again"

												Updates
I'll just mention a few things that bug me, I still recommend the game
-The sounds the motorcycles make when the shocks get used at all sound absolutely ridiculous
-The ai teammates are pretty dumb
-The physics are a bit odd in certain situations
-The civilians really don't care about cartel murdering everyone
-I've been ran over twice while scoping out bases from the road (civilians don't always stop)
-The radio is pretty dull
None of this is game breaking, its still really good, these are just a few issues that bug me while I play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just wanted to post a review for the people who were on the fence about buying this after playing the beta, it is worth it in my opinion. 

I played the beta, and honestly didn't think I was going to buy it. It looked like a game I've played a hundred times before, but I read a couple of other reviews after the beta and decided to take the risk and I honestly think it will be worth it. 7 hours in and I haven't gotten 100% completion of the first area.

A complaint I saw about the story (I believe from IGN) said that is was lacking, boring, and skippable... I disagree. This story isn't bad, its not game of thrones quality, but it is pretty good. 
My complaints are the helicopter controls are goofy, I don't think it is finished when it comes to optimization, and there are a few bugs... but its a new game, it can be patched. 

Aside from that, the game is everything you would expect it to be. If you like ghost recon and open world stuff, you'll enjoy this. GTA is a very similar feel, and I feel like GTA is a better game if you do not already have that.

Bottom line, if you were somewhat interested in the game, go ahead and pick it up."

												Really enjoying this game, It runs really well on my mediocure machine (GTX 960 Ti). The gun play is fun, and the story is actually good if you read and watch all the intel clips you can pick up. Don't mind the weinies saying this game is frustrating, they just haven't figured out how to be tactical and use the game's mechanics to their advantage. I have not had any issures with connectivity either so it may be some folks just don't have their NAT type set properly. The views in this game are pretty breath taking with the fidelity and amount of detail that has been put into the world map.

OVERALL: 8/10 
GRAPHICS: 9/10
FUN (with friends 10/10) (without friends 7/10)

If you like open world games and military style shooters this one is a must in my book."

												I really wanted to enjoy this game. Open world, stealth, shooter... Everything I personally like in a game. During the open beta, the game ran flawlessly on mostly high settings minus one which I had to keep low due to vram usage. However the game is now completely unplayable and freezes anytime I'm near enemies or driving. Now I know other people with higher end cards have not had issues, however my gtx 770 is now unable to run it.

Various fixes didn't work. Turning off the controller, disabling vsync, locking the fps to 60... I tried restarting the game, restarting my computer, validating the files. 

Now, in terms of gameplay during the open beta, the game was amazing. Single player and coop were both immensely fun to run around and stealth my way through all of the different camps. The gunplay was good, and the AI, while a bit stupid at times, generally provided an entertaining challenge. For many people, however, the game will become very repetitive. It's a lot of go to point A so you can go to point B. Clear the enemies so you can clear more enemies. 

My final opinion is that the game is worth playing, however it is currently unplayable. At least in my case that holds true."

												Had a blast playing last night, from launch all the way up until 7 AM (CST) this morning!  I participated in both the Closed Beta and the Open Beta and on both occassions I had good experiences. 
 
During the Betas, I only had two issues: 
1. I had my cpu overclocked to 4.6 Ghz (i7 6700K) and somehow this cause the game to crash in the Open Beta but not in the Closed Beta). 
 
2. How long the game takes to read from the HDD - my HDD for the Betas was a Toshiba at 7,200 rpms (my Non-Steam Games HDD) and this is not an issue for other new games, even though HDDs are always slower than SSDs.  So if you are able, I recommend installing this game on an SSD - if possible. 
 
At full release, the game is running on a Seagate at 7,200 rpms (my Steam HDD) still utilizes the HDD heavily, 99% to 100% on loading every time any loading takes place and this is why I recommend installing this game on an SSD is possible. 
 
So, with those two very minor issues out of the way, I must say that I love this game. 
 
Co-op Gameplay - Thus far, I have not played in co-op yet and I can imagine the fun shennanigans that are to be had in that mode.  I am primarily a story driven gamer who does also enjoy a bit of co-op at times and with the right people.  So, if you would like to play in co-op with me then just ask. 
 
The A.I. Teammates - I think they are great to have with me, although I do see where having actuall human teammates will be far more beneficial than the A.I. ones and I am grateful to have the A.I. team with me.  Their stories and banter are funny and they let you know when there are enemies, intel and lootable items present in the area.  When you fall, they will heal you once to give you a second chance to triumph over the enemies. 
 
Do I recommend this game - yes I certainly do.  I have never played any of the previous Ghost Recon titles yet, so I will not compare this one to any of them for obvious reasons.  I do think that there are elements from some other Ubisoft titles that I own and play, such as Far Cry 3 and 4 and perhaps a bit of The Division where we shoot through enemies to get the main boss in an area, but thankfully the enemy NPCs are not bullet sponges with crazy advantages like they are in The Division. 
 
I am playing on Windows 10 with an i7 6700K @ 4.6 Ghz with an EVGA GTX 1070 FTW and 16 GB of G.Skill TridentZ RAM in 1080p on Nvidia GeForce Experience settings with everything turned on - except VSync and Frame Limiting, Long Range Shadows and Nvidia Multi-Frame Sampled Anti-Aliasing.  My fps ranges from 49 to 85 fps in game and everything is very smooth, no screen tearing, no stuttering nor choppiness."

												Nice enough game with a lot of lovely content..
Can be stunning in places.... Real pleased I was able to buy it.

Varied gameplay; tons of options... Bots to Live MultiPalyer Ops at the flick of a switch.

Runs great on my 3-year old rig with a newish GPU (GTX1070).
Has a few things a few percent of people with strange expectations are ungrateful about..

1) The Game is designed to look even better on future hardware (such as the very recently released GTX1080Ti).
2) A GOOD rig is required to run this game. A top i5 or an i7 is going to be the way to go. No potatoes.
3) It did run nicely on Medium settings on my 3y/o Haswell i5 R9 280 Crossfire rig... No complaints there.
4) You NEED a Good Internet connection. We have Fiber-Optic and have no connection issues in the Far East.
5) A GTX1070 Will run it nicely on Pretty High settings; assuming you have a good Motherboard & upated Drivers.
6) Make sure you install the game on a good Gaming-Hard-Drive/SSD, and not on some rusty old File Drive.
7) Enjoy.... 
    ...it might take a while to get your head around all the details of the game and what to do, but that`s good. 
 
Oh, and yes there are a couple of bugs.. 
Those of us who re-map cannot steer the motorcycles.
There is no Mapping for the 6-Home/End Keys.... for some unknown reason.
There may be others I have not found yet."

												This game has hundreds of hours of content. That is amazing, I love the gun play however the vehicle control is weird but you get used to it. Over all the game is amazing and im happy with it.

WHAT I AM NOT HAPPY WITH is the fact that on day one ubisoft has two dlc's planned out and they are selling the weapons and attachments in the store for real money. Ubisoft you need to calm down and stop being greedy. I feel like Ubisoft has dlc on day one becauce they kept that stuff out of the game to sell it later. DLC is not supposed to be there on day one! That just tells people you have been planning and probably making the DLC for a good while now and you didnt just put it in the base game.

Otherwise this game is amazing and you should buy for sure."

												After, about 40 hours of gameplay.  I have to say. i am not totally hooked. but i did enjoy it. minor some annoyances.

This game had the potential to be, the best game ever made. but then it fell short. 

here are the pros:

Incredibly amazing graphics that  Runs smootly, spanning over a huge map.
The combat and AI are Above what you would consider Average. 
The Story line and acting is somewhat captivating. 
Performance wise, this game is gold. with just a few bugs i encountered. (Called for SUV, landed on my head and killed me). but this only happened once. 

some of the silly things

Game has a little bit of the MAD max sandbox syndrome. A little, not entirely that much. 
See i enjoyed MAdMAx, but having or feeling like you have to do all those side repetetive grind tasks on the side can be dreary. and until now i still havent finished the game. In Ghost i feel like it might end up the same way.
As i said, the story line it self is brilliant. but since the game needs you to do all the side tasks to improve your self. well.

prepare to do 24 times each of the following.
Steal helicopter, steal plane, steal truck, Attack sattelite relay, press E on two Towers 1km apart in 1min time.
Tag a supply drop, and deffend a radio relay, and i think scare soem guy to death by shouting crpa in his ears.....etc? maybe i missed one or two.

See after doing this maybe 7 times now, i really dont wanna do it again, and yet i have to. anyways. I just wish Sandbox games would do less with this repetetive nonesense. I dont mind that i have seen some bases more than once. (copy and paste) I dont mind as there are lots of variety still. and you do feel like you are really in an entire country. I trully enjoyed flying or boating down river. its trully a visual experience on a 34 in screen at least.

in a nutsehll, i really feel like they missed out on an opportunity to make something truly epic. with all the rooms they had to play with. they could have shown GTA V how you can do it better. but then again. GTA spent 300m$.

MUTIPLAYER CO-OP.

Unless its your friends on MIC COMS. just dont bother. 3  AI are more fun, have better things to say. and can be assinged to SYNC shoot. so you can kill 4 ore more in one hit. really. dont bother palying with randoms. just takes longer and it spoils the sequencin of your campign map. 

anyways, i hope you enjoy the game."

												Downvotes for Ubisoft games are usually very common, mainly because the company itself is pure cancer and treats their customers like ♥♥♥♥. With Ghost Recon Wildlands they offer about everything I hate about modern video gaming: Pre-order DLC, ""Deluxe Edition"" with additional cosmetic items, Season-Pass and Microtransactions that would even be too much in a f2p title. So I'm missing out on tons of stuff by ""just"" spending 60€ (and not preordering).
So if you ask me, Ubisoft deserves all the disrespect there is and even more.

BUT: Would I still recommend Ghost Recon Wildlands? Yes, definitely! All the hate for Ubisoft and their shady business practises can't change that this is a very enjoyable game, set in a beautiful world with an intense atmosphere. The story is interesting so far and the storytelling through a lot of different types of sources makes it even more enjoyable (Videotapes, Phonecalls, Audiotapes, interrogations and other cutscenes etc.).

Just don't buy the crap they offer. Don't get cosmetics, additional weapons, XP Boosts, don't pre-order and let the season pass go ♥♥♥♥ himself! This is the only way things will ever change back to the good, where we receive 100% of the product for 100% of an AAA titles price."

												Very good game. It takes lots to run though. I got a Gtx 980m and it runs around 50fps on medium preset.  There's always something to do, it's more fun in co op"

												I held a bad guy hostage so my friend could snipe him from 600m away. Also I can kick cartel in the nuts so hard they die.

This game is great fun with weird but hilarious bugs."

												The patches fixed bugs the game had. The game is more stable than before. Even Watch_Dogs 2 is optimized, this game is more optimized than WD2. I truly recommend this game at this time. It's worth its price tag."

												I played the Beta and now this. 
Let me tell you, I am impressed. Ubisoft raises from it's ashes with a great game.

PROS:
- AMAZING Graphics, downgrade from E3 is barely noticable.
- Gameplay transition between Singleplayer/coop is seemless and well made.
- Character customization is good, not the best but good enough for this type of game.
- Map is huge and very fun to discover.
- Playing with friends is very fun.
- Arcade-ish combat system which I very like, not too realistic not too unrealistic: just perfect.

CONS:
- Optimization is... lacking. But is not the worst. My 1080 was able to handle Ultra rounding near 60 fps at all times.
- Gameplay tad repetitive in singleplayer.

I recommend this game to anyone!"

												For a Ubisort game on pc at release I'm suprised to say it's pretty good. Seems to be optimized really well and even the random matchmaking was running flawlessly no lag issues/glitches.
♥♥♥♥ is fun"

												Don't try to run it on a toaster and you're good.

Good game, more fun with friends. Vehicle physics could be better. Plane rudder control should have been separated from the roll control.  
Don't listen to the 12 years old who don't appreciate sh*. Developers have put in a lot of efforts into this and it is visible when you play it."

												Performance has been improved a lot since beta. Now I am able to run at Ultra on my GTX 1070 (Laptop). Vehicle control still needs to be improved. However, I really enjoy the game."

												the game is.....fun.... but i cant reccomend it if your planning on playing alone its is definetly a friends needed game, the AI isent bad or anything....as a matter of fact they are so good it makes it kinda easy....but with friends you have to time shots and use strategy to get through missions.....not to mention all the insuing chaos.

games beatiful i run it at around 50-80 fps on ultra setting long shadows and enchanced god rays and nvida turf and hbao on loading screens are kinda long but i end up with a smooth running game and now missing textures. weapon custimization is pretty cool and im glad you cant just use everything right off the bat and have to work for it but.....it is anyoing at times since i need to go through a whole military base just to get a scope for my assualt rifle but its all part of the kit. overall rating 8.5/10"
