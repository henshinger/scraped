												This program is amazing.
Although it's considered ""basic"" for some users at the moment, it will get you started on a game almost immediately. I recommend buying it since the RPG Maker community is very nice and you get free resources every Wednesday.
EDIT: I have now run into the error where custom content doesn't seem ""allowed"" at the moment"

												If you are looking to jump into making anime style RPGs without too much hassle then this is a great program for you to use.  If you have some past coding experience with java then you can do wonders with this program in regards to making highly customized games that are unique to you.  RPG MAKER MV comes with lots of tile sets, character styles, and music that allow you to start making games right away.  

I am using this program to make personalized games for the grandkids Christmas 2016.

If you are looking to make platformer or top down shooters, or other types of games, then check out Construct 2."

												RPG MAKER MV open new world of possibilities to make the RPG of your dreams!

Also with enthusiastic RPG Maker fans who keep asks and also answers, and some known RPG Maker plugin makers that keep trying to customize even further with their (newly) JavaScript plugins I believe the future of RPG Maker will be more shines than before.

INFO: You should aware that this software doesn’t directly create an .apk file for android. We need third party software’s for it, but this method is widely used and known. Nothing wrong with it."

												I probably followed the same path as most people. I didn't know how to make a video game and one day I thought ""Hell, why not?"". Enter the RPG Maker franchise. Its main attraction is that it can let you make a video game even though you don't know how to use codes and all. This software is a real game-making noob magnet. As you're reading this, I bet you're feeling exactly like I did.

When I first opened the program, I guess I felt like most RPG Maker neophytes. I thought ""What in the world am I going to do now?"". The software will barely guide you. You'll feel helpless for a few minutes, to say the least. There are no tutorials, just limited information here and there. There's an underwhelming amount of tools and icons which will make you wonder whether or not you have to unlock a ""pro"" mode somewhere that'll hopefully uncover additional stuff. Well, that's ""pro mode"" for you. What you see is what you get. The sprites, scenery ""tiles"" and other assets are also extremely limited. 21st century instinct will kick in and you'll eventually do like everyone else: you rely on your good ol' internet and search for the missing knowledge. ""How do I make RPG Maker work?""

After a couple of hours or so, you'll figure out that the RPG Maker franchise is somehow continuously lacking in content and that it heavily relies on its online community to actually make things happen. And thank God this community exists. There are countless plugins, animations, tilesets, etc. at your disposal. And, so far, although I haven't interacted with a lot of people, I have to say that this community is highly positive, always interested in improving all the RPG Maker softwares and their games, whether it be their game or someone else's. They are always willing to help the newcomers - which is something I truly admire in today's world where most people will frown upon those who always ask the same questions and come up with the same issues as they learn and progress.

With a bunch of plugins in hand, you will eventually discover that RPG Maker MV has tons of additional potential. It's still limited, of course. Obviously, you can't make a 3D FPS, for example, but there are possibilities of making something else which might not be a RPG in the true nature of the genre. There are good examples out there on the net.

Now here's the hard part. Think of RPG Maker as a car. Now imagine everyone has the exact same car. You'll need to make your own parts in order to make your car unique. It's the same with RPG Maker. If your desire is to make a game to remember, you need to make your own sprites, your own backgrounds, your own music, etc. There's no way to make a good game only with what RPG Maker offers.

This leads me to believe that the people involved with this program are somewhat lazy and greedy. Lazy because they could make an editor which would allow you to create stuff within RPG Maker. Greedy because the price is quite high for what the program delivers and also because they appear to have stopped updating the software, instead delivering pricey DLCs so they can milk the cow a little more, using - or abusing - those who don't have the skills to make their own sprites, backgrounds, etc... Considering that they've made a good amount of money with this popular software, you'd think that they would offer more free content and that they wouldn't just let other folks do the hard, dirty work by creating useful plugins.

But, yeah, the software neverthelessly delivers. Thanks to the community. Will you make a game? Can't say for sure. I believe many people will either make a very crappy game and let it go for free or will simply abandon the software after realizing it requires a bunch of hours viewing fan-generated tutorial videos and reading fan-generated tips and hints. This leaves us with a minority of creators that will produce decent games and an extremely tiny minority that will make great, if not amazing games to remember. If you want to make such a game with RPG Maker, you really have to prepare yourself because you'll have to spend hundreds of hours on this project of yours. There's also a lot of trial-and-error in the way. It demands a lot of dedication, that's for sure. But that's not related to RPG Maker. It's the same scenario for anyone who wishes to make a video game, no matter the softwares being used.

I can't say I'm disappointed even though I do feel like I paid a little too much for this. But that's just me. It works. It truly does. But you'll have to work more than it does. Are you ready for it?"

												An easy to use game maker engine that builds off the foundation set by its predecessors. I say 'game maker' rather than RPG maker because it has the potential to create other genres such as action, adventure and visual novel games, just like  the previous engines.

Its simple and familiar look makes it easily accessible to people who have already used any of the previous engines, and is approachable to people new to it as well. It contains more features than any of the previous engines. JavaScript looks formidable compared to Ruby, but everything can be learned in time. The character generator has much better parts than the Ace one, and even provides a base and parts for their sideview battles.

Despite the familiar appearance, it has been remade completely, so bugs are expected from something so new. I've only encountered graphical bugs so far, but none of the lag mentioned (using a 4 year old i5 laptop with a generic graphics card that has update-to-date drivers). Just need to point out that practically every single program and game out there has bugs on release. The important thing is that the reported issues are being fixed, the developers just need time.

Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, and glad to have it despite the bugs. Kudos to the Degica team who worked so hard to see this program released this early, and who are still dealing with the issues related to the program together with Kadokawa."

												I would not recommend this or any ""cookie-cutter"" game maker software to someone who wants to produce a finished commercial product.  When it comes to RPGs these days, you need more than a tremendous story/characters/dialogue or else your product will never get noticed.  When you use ""cookie-cutter"" game makers, that story aspect is the only originality you can provide.

But within certain contexts, RPG Maker MV is simply amazing.  I want to spend a year designing maps, story, characters and dialogue for my RPG.  Most of the original aspects to my proposed product revolve around audio and combat, which aren't possible with RPG Maker MV.  Hard to tell if your proposed story/character mechanics will work until you play them, and it's hard to motivate to spend a year coding software (for me, AGK2) so I can BEGIN playtesting the story.

No chicken n' egg problem if you have something like RPG Maker MV.  You can develop both simultaneously, because it's so simple to work with RPG Maker MV.  

So if you're approaching RPG making like I am, I can't recommend this enough.  I'm only a half hour in and I've already got most of the basics down (to emphasize, I have a coding background which aids with immediately understanding certain structures that RPG Maker MV is essentially a shell for, even though it's not involving direct coding at all).  If you're looking for something that will be the final product, and sell it for money, I'd have to roll my eyes, yes, yes."

												For someone who has been experimenting with just about every RPG Maker from 2003~VX Ace.
I have to say this is one of THE best RM's to this date.

I really love the simple built in Side View battle system which is easy to use and no
complicated scripting is needed.


This will be the FIRST RPG Maker that I will actually use for a commercial project.
It's that good.

I knew when seeing the trailer before the release was announced that I was going to
enjoy this, and I Pre-Ordered this as soon as I could without second thoughts.

I recommand this to anyone who loves making RPGs.
It's litterally the BEST that has been released so far.


However, I'd suggest you listen to the System Specs.
I had to get a new PC to use the program at ease compared to the previous makers.
(I was getting a gaming PC anyways, so it wasn't a big deal.)"

												Oh boy, where do I even start on this? Honestly, I really want to like this. I really do. There are some good things to it - an options menu, the plugins, etc... But there's so much missing that it does not feel right. At all. I didn't need the ""sound test"" this includes - VX Ace had something similar to that. However, I do need an assets menu to make importing custom features easier. I do need an easy way to access scripts. I do need some way to import a VX Ace project to MV so I don't have to restart everything. I do need the ability to disable the RTP to make the download size smaller. At least include the characters from the cover art in the actual software instead of DLC, you know?! It's very new, but there are far too many problems for me to just accept it. Simply put, it feels nowhere near complete, ditches some of the most useful parts of VX Ace, and doesn't really bother making up for the things it scrapped."

												I rather enjoy it. I got it on sale. I wouldn't quite recommend it at full price, unless you really want this engine that badly. Still, it's a fairly excellent engine. As I'm writing this review, there are a ridiculous amount of free plugins, and some even came with the engine. The plugins are a fun and easy method to customize your game when compared to the scripting methods of previous engines. I actually like the basic tilesets and music, even though I want more and more variety. Luckily, there are plenty of free resources to find on the Internet if you look hard enough. There is also a bunch of DLC on Steam if you're willing to fork over some cash. The Steam Workshop also has a few things. As time goes on, the RPG Maker community will no doubt provide you with more to work with. Now, if you don't know anything about how to use an RPG Maker engine, especially not this MV version, then go to YouTube. There are quite a few fun tutorials to watch. Some are broad and some are very specific. This engine itself runs beautifully with my crappy toaster of a computer. So, there's that. My favorite thing to do with this engine is mapping. Just ... mapping. It pleases my brain."

												This software has been getting an undeserved amount of flak in these reviews; in my honest opinion having played around with VX Ace and XP (not all on steam however), this is probably the most powerful RPG Maker yet.

Pros:-Javascript. I know a lot of people are upset about it having very little compatibility with Ruby like the last RPG Makers, but these new Javascript plugins are insanely powerful. Earlier today I met someone who was able to get their project sending data back and forth to an online server, something no RPG maker game has *ever* been able to do in the past. It may be far too taxing to develop an actual online RPG Maker game, but online features to some extent are a definite possibility now, and that's great. Moreover, Javascript is a much more commonly-used language than Ruby ever was, and there are no more hidden classes limiting the scope of scripts, and far fewer hard-coded limitations.

-Plugin manager to easily import and control your plugins. Keep in mind that script order does still matter, but the only way to move plugins up or down is to cut and paste them elsewhere in the list. ""Move Plugin Up or Down"" buttons are not included.

-All of the same features of VX Ace, plus larger tile size and screen resolution and a smarter map-editor. Or, if you don't want the larger sizes, you can go back to 32x tiles and the smaller res of VX Ace with some of the preorder javascript plugins, all of which you can find online for free with the same terms of use if you did not preorder.



Cons:-Clarity. This is the biggest reason for the number of negative reviews. The developers of the software have not been as clear in communicating their product's features as they could have. For instance, they advertised android/iOS porting, and people assumed they would be getting an automated tool that did everything for them. However, this is not the case, and falls on both the end user's expectations and the company failing to clarify that only a simple step-by-step guide would be provided for this purpose, rather than an automated too.

-[Pending an update] Day One problems. There aren't lots of pre-made database entries out of the box. As I understand it, the game was released in English before everything was fully localized, so the starting database has very little pre-made content to use. However, all of the resources to make content are there. And the pre-order DLC is in the install folder, giving even more content. The developers intend to update this and fully complete the localization in the future. Moreover, some are getting weird performance errors the developers didn't expect. Again, they intend to fix as many of these issues as they can.

-No resource manager. This might be a turn off for some, because it was such a nice feature of VX Ace, but I feel this isn't a major issue.



Overall:This is overall the best RPG Maker iteration yet, mostly because of the more open feel to scripting, and the great amount of documentation for the features of the engine and the javascript methods to use, all by pressing F1 in the editor to open the expansive help page. Moreover, the preorder plugins made by yanfly and so many others all have documentation of their own, with Yanfly having made tens of videos going in-depth on tips and tricks to do with their plugins and how to best use everything that's there."

												This program isn't able to create an .apk file for android.
You just get the files, you have to create an .apk with additional software (python + java + android SDK + several different steps to do) by YOURSELFE.
This iformation is shown in the help (F1) at the point: ""Documentation -> Converting to an Android App"".

For a 70€ program that says in the advertisement that you can build an RPG easy for android and so on (for children), it isn't!

Because I get more and more answers to my review which say: ""you didn't expect to have to download the Android SDK and required tools for compiling to the Android platform?""
No I didn't, because the publisher of this product present his software like: supporting and create games for android / iOS, easy for a child. It isn't said that you need additional software. IT's shown as you have to click on a button to compiling to an android / iOS app."

												I've been watching RPG Maker grow up since RM2K and it's definitely come a long way.  Let me tell you what RPG Maker is. It is an exceedingly awesome tool for making 2D JRPG style games. If you want to make your own Skyrim, this isn't the engine you're looking for...but people have created all kinds of amazing things with RPG Maker, diablo/baldur-like games, puzzle games, hidden object/visual novel, shoot-em-ups, arcade games, platformers and more.  For people who can think outside the box and don't limit themselves to the default artwork the possibilities are nearly endless. RPG Maker games with artwork reminiscent of MS Paint have achieved massive popularity and even commercial success. Lisa is just one example of many.

With MV moving from Ruby based scripting to Javascript, it opens up a whole new realm of possibilities. That said, ""Simple enough for a child"" may be a tad bit of hype. Your 3 year old? No. But a bright inquisitive 8 year old with a little help and encouragement? Definitely.

The RPGMakerWeb forums have a massive wealth of knowledge and if you're new to RPG Maker check out Kelsper's Beginner's Guide to RPG Maker VX Ace. There have been some changes but most of it still applies. This guide will answer most newcomers' questions and give you a solid base to work from.
http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?/topic/1249-beginnergeneral-beginners-guide-to-rpg-maker-vx-ace/

One of the biggest selling points is the added export capabilities to mobile platforms as well as PC and Mac with no additional cost like many game engines have. MV still has some bugs to iron out of course and if you don't need those additional options and already have a previous version of RPG Maker, then maybe stick with that and wait for a sale, but I wouldn't expect one until the later half or end of 2016.

Do people make bad RPG Maker games? God, yes. On an industrial scale. More than you could play in a lifetime. It's not RPG Maker's fault. But, people also make a lot of really awesome games. And some games that you can't even tell were made with RPG Maker. And some of those ""bad games"" are actually some of the most popular!

What is RPG Maker? ""A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there...is a choice I leave to you."" -Neo (that guy from Point Break that couldn't shoot Patrick Swayze)"

												I wholeheartedly recommend RPG Maker MV as a starter software for anyone who is interested in making a game.
I see a lot of people who recommend Unity, or Unreal Engine as ""easy"" tools for beginners, but both of those require a decent coding knowledge of some description (well, Unreal Engine 4 not so much) and on top of that you will need to make your own assets for the game to be high-quality, unless you want to purchase an asset pack off someone else.

RPG Maker requires zero coding experience, just patience and understanding. The eventing system, while it takes a bit of time to fully figure out (Self switches and ""delete event"" commands reset after you change map - I learned that the hard way and had to change a large amount of my story triggers), is very simple to use, but allows for (functionally) limitless possibilities. 

Improvements over VX Ace, the previous iteration of the software, include (for those interested):
- Changing the nightmare-inducing front portrait character generator to a side portrait one, allowing you to create much                                more aesthetically pleasing character portraits. 
- Native Sideview Battle mode, no longer requiring custom scripting.
-Significantly improved OST, with much improved themes for everything.
-Javascript instead of Ruby (kind of a big deal, plugins are now able to do a lot more)
-Export to pretty much anything (Browser, Android, IOS, Windows etc.) whereas VX Ace only supported Windows (I think)
-Modern Tilesets/assets provided with the base game - no more reliance on custom content for a modern-themed RPG.
-Various QoL improvements (showing you where the dialog window cuts off when editing, so you don't accidentally have your text not showing properly ingame because you forgot to hit enter)
-Native Touch/Mouse control support.

If you can't afford it at base price (it is pretty expensive, to be fair) you can wait for a sale, and I'm told that key reseller websites sell it for a much lower price (about 50% cheaper), but use those at your own risk.

Either way, this is a brilliant tool for anyone interested in game design, beginner or otherwise. (I might go as far as to say it is the tool to start with for those who are interested in game development but have little/no coding knowledge.

Definitely Recommend."

												I want to say that this really is an amazing game maker it actually has a lot of versatility, and I am very impressed. 

A couple things I want to say for people reading this: 

If you are the kind of person who starts something and doesn't finish it you probably won't like it.

If you are the kind of person who needs instant gratification, and need there to be action right then you probably won't like it either

For those of you who have no experience in game making like me, you can still make a pretty good game with just a little practice, and there are plenty of guides out there so don't let that stop you. For those of you who have experience game making that helps too.

I also want to say that if you want to make your own graphics for your game though and not use other people's you need to be able to use photoshop well, but I am content to use other people's (There are a lot of people who make graphics for it online)

Overall I highly recommend it."

												So I checked out this Game on the Free Weekend... 

I have used like almost all the RPG Makers out there... 

Here is what i've noticed... 

RPG Maker 2k3 seems the best in Features, but programming is pretty good, 
but not great... It has a lot of features implemented already... 

RPG Maker XP is an Improvement, but the Graphix are more old school, 
& not a good... 

RPG Maker VX however drops some features, but it includes a more advanced 
Programming system this time around, & Graphix has improved... 

RPG Maker VX Ace drops even more features, but improves Programming 
even more... 

RPG Maker MV drops alot of features, but adds Java Script & Multi OS 
Support... 




All in all, i'd probably stick to RPG Maker 2k3, or XP, or RPG Maker VX, but if you want to 
Program for other OS, then MV is for you... 

I personally like 2k3 the best, but also use VX, sometimes... =D"

												I've just started playing with this engine and so far I'm pretty happy with it.

Some major pros:
-The graphic style looks to be designed for mobile platforms
-The engine is easy to navigate and use
-Multi platform export options (obviously)

Major cons:
-The anime style and chibi characters might turn some people away
-Default resources are kinda scarce

Overall:
With a bit of creativity you can make tons of games unique using the default graphics,I have been a fan of the Rpg maker series for years and I own several. Mv is definitely my new favourite since VxAce, I like the few changes in art style and resolution.
This engine has a lot of potential, it's up to the users to discover it and use it.
That said the engine does lag a little and takes a bit of time to load things properly, I believe this is due to a tiny memory leak because it uses Javascript as Javascript is known to cause such issues.
I don't mind that because I like the engine and I will use it until the next engine in the series comes out even if it takes 100 years!"

												A massive list of major improvements make it worth your while!	
I LOVE RPG Maker MV. I've started a brand new project with it, and there's just so many moments where I'm like ""Wow..."" or ""Cool!"" or ""No Way!"" It's just designed so much better so your life while using it is that much less of a headache. It's extremely powerful and much more functional then any previous version of RM, even Ace. There's so many things about it that make you feel like, ""If only Ace had had this, it would have made my life, and my game, so much better."" And that's why it's so good. 

 PROS 
    A brilliant new GUI
    A fabulous new Character Editor - includes side view battler, the ability to save your character and come back to it
    Interwoven with Javascript - a major improvement over Ruby. The plugin system is a lifesaver. It just presents all of your options and parameters for you  
    Absolutely gorgeous built-in assets, so you can get straight into making your game and it looks GOOD
    Side-view battle!
    Event searcher! This will undoubtedly save my life
    Craploads of little additions like allowing enemies to appear mid-way through a battle, and other things that would require annoying scripting otherwise
    Tons of performance improvements for both the engine and the game itself
    Mac Support! Yay Mac users!
    iOS and Android export may take some effort, but BUILT-IN TOUCH SUPPORT AND EMULATION IS SO COOL
 CONS 

    It's crashed on me a couple times already. That is frightening.
    It's kind of annoying that I had to install the DLC and full database myself. Was worth it though.
    Little extra features like auto-aligining troops for side-view, more built-in battle customization and a NORMAL LOOKING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BROWN EYE COLOUR WOULD BE NICE

In all seriousness, though, it's amazing. Sure you gotta do some of the work yourself, but this is GAME DEVELOPMENT SOFTWARE people! If you didn't come with the intentions of getting your hands dirty, you're in the wrong place!

I'm SUPER excited for how this software will develop in the coming months both from the development side and the community side, and I'm really looking forward to making incredible games with this baby!

Do you want to make games? Yes: Buy this.
Do you like previous versions of RPG Maker, but want more? Yes: Buy this.
Do you want to stop reading this long-♥♥♥ review and just buy it already? YES!!!!!!! BUY IT!"

It has more options for the character generator that actually match the default characters, the screen is bigger, and there are more options for tilesets and music.

												I started with RPG Maker VX Ace, but later upgraded to MV when it went on sale. Even at full price, I highly recommend any user of RPG Maker to get MV (though I don't blame you if you wait until it is on sale). Either way, it's worth every penny. MV contains the functionality and flexibility of VX Ace (the previous release) with all kinds of new features that make it stand out. Such features include an improved character creator, more tilesets, editing during live play, and of course, more export and deployment options. My current game-in-progress is now an application on my phone, which I soon to hope to release on Google Play. This simply can't be done with VX Ace (or any previous release). Don't get me wrong - VX Ace was fantastic, but MV is just extraordinary. Enterbrain doesn't deceive - if I can learn to use RPG Maker, anyone can. In addition, I'm not a programmer by any stretch. And they're right - you don't have to be one. 

There are a few downsides I would like to point out. For example, while again, you don't have to be a programmer, I would be lying if I said it didn't help if you know what you're doing. Plugins quickly became very confusing to me. Once I got the hang of them, though, I learned how awesome they can be and how well they can enhance your games. I also was a little disappointed with the character creator, because you can make children actors/NPCs with it as well, but you only have girls, and only one choice of anything. Apparently you need to buy a season pass or something to unlock more choices, which I personally thought was kind of lame of them to do. 

The only other issue I have is how complicated deployment can be - I honestly had to use videos from YouTube to help me get the right software and do the right things. It's not rocket science by any means, but it is more challenging than I anticipated to put a game out there on mobile. Nevertheless, don't let my confusion discourage you. RPG Maker MV is by far the best version."

												Bought this as a side project, now after the month line I've logged my 130th hour and counting.
When my first game launches I'm sure that it'll just be stratching the surface of the new tool I've stumbled across. Hooked already indefinitly and big plans for a set of games.
Easy to use, in the sense that anything you want to add to your game is dependant on your skill and effort, and most importantly on your ability to learn. I came into this with no coding knowledge and found myself at a disadvantage, until I learned and adapted myself. Anything is possible when you set your mind to it.
9/10

												Alright, here's the thing about this program. It's amazing. As an artist, I understand how much effort has to go into each tileset and character and musical score. It makes sense that it costs money to get things for it, and the amount it gives you with the base software is fantastic for what it is. Game development is hard. A lot of people will never finish their games when they buy this, or will make a little base-pack romp and wonder why it gets bad reviews, but that's not this software's fault. The resources are there to make something amazing with this. But it's a tool. It's like buying a workshop, which includes a simple birdhouse kit, and then cursing the tools for the fact that all you can build is the birdhouse. You gotta work for it. You have to buy more wood. You have to practice your sawcuts, you need to buy better paints and brushes so the colors can be cleaner and more vibrant. With that workshop, you can build anything, but if all you can see is that one birdhouse, it'll never be what you want it to be."

2. Start a project.
3. Make half your database.
4. Decide it's too hard, and give up.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 an indefinite number of times.
6. Decide to actually finish a game.
7. Spend a year making it.
8. Try to play it.
9. Bang your head in frustration when it doesn't work.
10. After three months and an extensive amount of JS knowledge, fix it.
11. Feel satisfied.
12. Repeat steps 8-11 until you're sick of fixing bugs.

												A lot of the negative comments about RMMV are from people who haven't taken the time to work out how to use the new engine. The character generator is excellent, much improved over VXAce, and allows you to quickly and easily make a variety of faces, field sprites and animated battlers with a few clicks. Furthemore, these graphics do not clash with the default resources (most of which are in a separate folder in DLC, to keep the file size of new projects down). the Database now starts off with only a handful of default weapons, skills and enemies, although all th animations are still there, and there are still a variety of reources included, they're just in ""BaseResource"" your DLC folder by default, something which a user can easily remedy by moving them to the ""NewData"" Folder, essentially allowing one to create a custom RTP with all the files one normally would import into any new project. 

Instead of RGSS Scripts, a new Java based plugin system is used. As someone with no programming knowledge, I much prefer this, as you can customise these much more easily. The included bonus plugins for the english release add a wealth of new features and optional tweaks, and are likewise incredibly customisable, using easy to understand menus rather than having to search through walls of code to find out how to change the size of a window or make a character move around the screen in battle animations for example. There are more than 40 plugins included in your DLC folder FOR FREE with every copy of RMMV, and the amount of things you can do with them is mesmerising. Now you can easily have skills cost HP, alter the menu and save screens, upgrade weapons, limit items, increase the default maximums, have text boxes that word wrap (FINALLY!), make the battle camera pan and zoom, have enemies chase you round the map, and just SOOOOO much more. My one criticism is that not inluding all these resources in each new project folder does mean that some people can get the impression that they don't exist. This is the best and most flexible version of RPG maker yet, and I've been using it since XP came out."

												There is a lot of good things I could say and this has lots of potential, but the reason I wouldn't recommend this is because from what I've seen and been able to do so far with it, it's not a huge improvement over their vx ace version which is cheaper so for now that's what I'd recommend, ""RPG Maker"" is a fairly good system and from what I see vx ace still has a lot of the same stuff mx does and the improvements mx has aren't all that useable without information that I can't seem to get my hands on. One of the things they advertise in mx, and was the thing that made me want to upgrade, is how you can make scripts in JavaScript, but while the support is there as you can see that there are some included examples that are in JavaScript, there is basically no information on the api between the two. so you either have to completely reverse engineer all the scripts you have access in order to figure out how to make your Javascript work in the game, or stuck using just the basic script editor which while it is easy to use it's not very versatile.  As without knowing the api there's no way for your advanced scripts to access any of the game data, or cause anything meaningful to happen in the game.  There is a help file that at the end does list some things you can use in the JavaScript code but it's really poorly organized and difficult to find stuff in and I think either it's missing some rather important bits or it's to poorly organized for me to find them. I even went looking for tutorials on their scripting system.  I found stuff on how to do it on vx ace, and plenty of material on how to program in JavaScript, but nothing on how the scripts tie into mx games which makes simply knowing how to program in JavaScript useless to making games.

So while RPG MAKER an awesome system that is a great starting point for anyone who wants to get into game development.  The MX version is not versatile enough to really go much beyond just starting out. So You'd be better off getting the VX Ace version at least until people have had a chance to get the how to use it better put together. 

I think if your good enough to reverse engineer their scripts and figure out how to use the JS scripts on your own, you'd probably also be able to figure out how to use a more advanced systems like unity or unreal. So while I'd recomend  the VX Ace to some one just getting started I'm not so sure if any of them are flexable enough for more advanced style games."

												I've been making RPG Maker Projects for years on 2000, 2003, and VX/VX Ace, and this is by far the most user friendly RPG Maker out there. The built in tool tips have allowed me to learn so much more about how everything works without having to resort to google. The Essentials DLC also gives you a skillfully remastered version of the absolutely stellar soundtrack of RPG Maker 2003 to use in your games (the soundtrack was the reason I stuck with 2003 for years), which is a major bonus. You can CHOOSE whether or not to have your game in side view or front view which is amazing and allows you to easily swap at the flick of a switch. Java Script plugins make adding in new scripts and mechanics into your game a lot easier, and is a lot easier programmers and scripters to write new stuff for. But in my opinion, far and away the best new feature that this iteration of RPG Maker has is the character generator. The ability to make my own resources and characters with this program has really opened up my imagination and made the ecreative process a lot more fun (it also creates a battle sprite for side view battles for whatever characters you make, which is fantastic compared to how VX Ace did not as it only featured front view by default.). This one feature has caused me to create characters that have literally quadrupled the scope of my main project, spurring me to create entirely new stories and plot lines just by having the ability to create something new from the vision in my head without having to be an expert spriter or artistically talented. That feature alone warrants my recommendation if you're interested in picking up another RPG Maker, but that combined with all the other pros further solidifies this as currently being the definitive RPG Maker software.

My only complaints concern how difficult it is to add new parts and resources into the character generator, and how it is sparse when it comes to creating non human characters. Thankfully there are a lot of resources out there to help with that, but still, the process to add that stuff in is really annoying and finnicky. MV would be ridiculously amazing if it had Steam Workshop support like VX Ace, and it would help with the aforementioned issues as well.

Overall, it's an amazing piece of software, and I'd recommend buying it. It's currently pretty pricey at $80, but as time goes on the sales on it will just get bigger and it'll be more affordable to most people. If you have the creative itch though and can't wait, I'd still recommend it at full price, it's really freaking great."

												I've spent extensive hours in this program and I absolutely love it.  Out of the box it is very simple to create fan games with little experience.  If you want to make a polished game it will take a bit more work, but the program offers you tools to accomplish that.  With the inclusion of Javascript over Ruby, it is far easier to both create your own plugins, or use other people's created plugins.

The program has the potential to put out quality games in the JRPG and action adventure genre, and with Javascript you could potentially spread this to other Genres as well.  

overall, this is a worthwhile purchase if you have an interest in making games but are intimidated by bigger engines like Cryengine or Unreal engine, or you just want to make a fan JRPG / professional JRPG."

												In it's current state, maybe 7/10. But, I got it for 55% off, so it was worth it.

The good:

* It does what it says it does. Helps you make an RPG fast.
* Lots of assets, effects, and animations, etc.
* It runs on my Mac.

The bad:

* The scripting interface is OK. But, It reminds me of FileMaker. Easy things are easy, and hard things are just that much more difficult. 
* Plugins are all all over the place. Why does RPG Maker not include a browser for published plugins with the ability to install them? This is possible with the Steam workshop, but plugin authors don't seem to have any incentive to publish them there. 
* JavaScript, the language of the Internet, is used for scripting. But, there isn't any built in command to load remote resources. Why not?"

												Great game engine. I don't say that this engine is the best among the other, but this engine comes with packed J-RPG-style drag and drop GUI. It's true that it's easy and simple enough for kids, but powerful enough for developer. Moreover since this engine comes with Javascript based plugins and can be exported into static HTML site which means we can deploy it almost everywhere, from PC, Mac, Android, iOS, even on the black and white Linux server :D 

I recommend this for everyone who want to learn creating game especially RPG and have lack of programming experience. BUT if you are a developer or programmer who looking after casual JS game engine or not focused on J-RPG games, I think the other engine is much better and easier to use."

It would have been nice if they already had made a plugin for Questing, since that is the only thing it need. In my opinion.
If you have played around with Rpgmaker vx ace i recommand this to you.

Can't really say much else about it.

What I will say is one naggitive that seems not to work 
Encrypting your game. 
does not work for me, no matter how hard I try.

Does not mean this is a bad engine to make your game.
So if you like spending lots of time making your own game.
I would say buy it. If you rather play games and not make them.
don't buy it. simply see what others who did buy this made for you to play.

												Like JRPGS? Want to make one? Cant afford to buy a fancy engine, to pay artists, programmers, and marketing guys? SICK WE HAVE THIS COOL PRODUCT!
Pros: 
Plugin system is super easy and comes with a bunch for controller support stc.
Easy to use, well documented tools for creating your own stories!
EXPORT TO MOBILE DEVICES! :D
Comes with free art you can use comercially! 
Easy set up for Side by side, or front view battles!
Comes with a basic outline of items/weapons/monsters so you can figure out how things work!

Cons:
Exporting to mobile devices takes a LOT of reading.
All of th eprevious art for RPG Maker games are useless because of their lower resolution (Kinda  a good thing?)
$80 (Keep in mind I have never actually paid full price for an RPG Maker title (mostly through sales) so I have no idea if it is a typical release price)

TL;DR
I like it more than I like the past entries and I have spent almost 12 hours so far just playing with all of the new stuff so I could write this review!

												It's rpg maker, but you really can do some cool things with it. You can add plugins to improve the functionality of the systems that you would usually use. You can even make your own plugins if you'd like. The map editor is pretty solid in my opinion. It even takes care of the layering for you. The Character creator is okay to get started but there are other programs available to help create cool RPG maker MV styled characters if you feel there aren't enough options. Basically you get a bunch of assets to get you started so you can focus on getting other parts of your game made. That said I still recommend trying your hand at drawing your own tiles :) Overall, I highly recommend this program for people who want to make a solid RPG game."

												I am so disappointed in this. A little backstory; I love RPG Maker VX Ace, and when I saw MV was on sale for $40 I simply couldn't pass it up. I purchased it aswell as a few DLC's becuase of how cheap they were, and I was so utterly depressed with what I got. So like normal, the DLC's were very confusing to even try to integrate into a project. That's expected and not why I wouldn't recommend this. The reason is from, I suppose the easiest way to say it, the interface and database shallowness. It seems with the default screen where you see all of the various buttons and such, that it feels so cartoony and not as serious as VX Ace. VX Ace seemed confusing but you realize you don't use half of the buttons anyways, but the interface itself seemed way too simplified and didn't feel like I was using an actual piece of software. At the same time, the database, now I'm not sure if this is a single issue for just me and if it is I apoligize, was the nail in the coffin. In every various tab it had maybe at max 5 items/characters/etc. each. That was it. VX Ace had so many things to offer from the beginning that most of the time you don't have to create your own stuff. 


Overall, I can see how this may appear to be bias so go ahead and click that unhelpful button. The software's artstyle for faces got me excited but left me a bit uninterested afterwards, and the interface feels like you're using KidPix (look it up). I know I'm complaining about how it isn't RPG Maker VX Ace, but it's the internet. What are you gonna do."

												I started with RPG Maker VX Ace, but later upgraded to MV when it went on sale. Even at full price, I highly recommend any user of RPG Maker to get MV (though I don't blame you if you wait until it is on sale). Either way, it's worth every penny. MV contains the functionality and flexibility of VX Ace (the previous release) with all kinds of new features that make it stand out. Such features include an improved character creator, more tilesets, editing during live play, and of course, more export and deployment options. My current game-in-progress is now an application on my phone, which I soon to hope to release on Google Play. This simply can't be done with VX Ace (or any previous release). Don't get me wrong - VX Ace was fantastic, but MV is just extraordinary. Enterbrain doesn't deceive - if I can learn to use RPG Maker, anyone can. In addition, I'm not a programmer by any stretch. And they're right - you don't have to be one. 

There are a few downsides I would like to point out. For example, while again, you don't have to be a programmer, I would be lying if I said it didn't help if you know what you're doing. Plugins quickly became very confusing to me. Once I got the hang of them, though, I learned how awesome they can be and how well they can enhance your games. I also was a little disappointed with the character creator, because you can make children actors/NPCs with it as well, but you only have girls, and only one choice of anything. Apparently you need to buy a season pass or something to unlock more choices, which I personally thought was kind of lame of them to do. 

The only other issue I have is how complicated deployment can be - I honestly had to use videos from YouTube to help me get the right software and do the right things. It's not rocket science by any means, but it is more challenging than I anticipated to put a game out there on mobile. Nevertheless, don't let my confusion discourage you. RPG Maker MV is by far the best version."

												This has to be the best 2d engine I've ever used for creating rpg games, its easy to use and also really powerful for making more complex games. The visual interface is really easy to use for creating items and maps and placing npc's all around the map, but it also comes with a really great event system that lets you create more complicated things like cutscenes and dungeon puzzles without having to do any coding.

Its been a while since rpg maker was this good (last one I liked was rpg maker xp) but rpg maker mv finally brings back the side view option for battles and it now supports more platforms like mac, browser and mobile for releasing your game on the app stores.

Plugin support is already pretty good with lots of custom menu and battle tweaks, although theres no action battle system plugins yet like there was for past rpg makers so you can't make a zelda like game just yet, but the rpg maker community is already putting out tons of content and tutorials to make working with this engine really easy.

This is the first time since rpg maker xp I can highly recommend this engine, rpg maker mv is better then ever before."

												I wholeheartedly recommend RPG Maker MV as a starter software for anyone who is interested in making a game.
I see a lot of people recommend Unity or Unreal Engine as ""easy"" tools for beginners, but both of those require a decent coding knowledge of some sort (well, Unreal Engine 4 not so much). On top of that, you will need to make your own assets for the game to be high-quality, unless you want to purchase an asset pack off someone else.

RPG Maker requires zero coding experience, only patience and understanding. The eventing system, while it takes a bit of time to fully figure out (e.g. self switches and ""delete event"" commands reset after you change map), is very simple to use, yet allows for (functionally) limitless possibilities.

Improvements over VX Ace, the previous iteration of the software, include:
-Changing the nightmare-inducing front portrait character generator to a side portrait one, allowing you to create much more aesthetically pleasing character portraits. 
-Native sideview battle mode, no longer requiring custom scripting.
-Significantly improved OST, with much improved themes for everything.
-Javascript instead of Ruby (kind of a big deal, as plugins are now able to do a lot more).
-Export to pretty much anything (Browser, Android, iOS, Windows, etc.) whereas VX Ace only supported Windows (I think).
-Modern tilesets/assets provided with the base game - no more reliance on custom content for a modern-themed RPG.
-Various QoL improvements (showing you where the dialog window cuts off when editing, so you don't accidentally have your text not showing properly in-game because you forgot to hit enter).
-Native touch/mouse control support.

If you can't afford it at base price, as it is pretty expensive, you can wait for a sale.

This is a brilliant tool for anyone interested in game design, beginner or otherwise. I might go as far as to say it is the tool to start with for those who are interested in game development but have little to zero coding knowledge.

Definitely recommended."

												RPG Maker MV is a great and flexible engine to bring your game ideas to life. 

Being interested in game development, but failing to start because of massive setbacks such as designing characters, creating a setting, and having no direction. However, with the pre-made assets you are able to prototype, prototype, and prototype. I stress this because understanding what you're doing will make you better and faster at making a game. You don't particularly need a story, a whole bunch of characters, or designed assets - the whole point is to understand game dev, and is most definitely worth the price. If you can, get it on sale!

I'm actually interested in the battle mechanics and events. I assure you that you can make a great game if the battle system is fun! Note that I only have about 100+ hours right now, but I still want to keep making and perfecting my game even if all I am working on is battle mechanics and events. It will never be released, but nothing won't stop you if you keep learning about the mechnics of the engine. Javascript makes it extremely flexible. 

And as others have said, plug-ins make the process of creation so easy, and there are many free resources online! If you're a beginner and need to experience making an RPG by all means go for this. The continued support for Javascript plug-ins doesn't hurt either."

												Overall its a good framework to make a 2d rpg or even a VN. Most of the limitations can be overcome with javascript. You can do a total graphical overhaul so it looks nothing like an rpg maker game. The problem with programming a game from scratch is organizing all the game data (weapons, items, enemies) and figuring out all the damage formulas which is a tedious boring task that rpg maker covers for you.

the event creator is kind of limiting though. There are some commands that let you choose an actor or an item with a variable while other commands only let you pick from a static list when it should let you use a variable as well. You can still circumvent it by writing javascript but its a little inconvinient. i hope the devs could change this."

												RPG Maker MV is definitely the best title in the series yet. With more options than ever before, more intuitive interface, better character generator, and new and returning features such as the side-view battle mode, Plugin Manager (replacing Script Editor from VX Ace), and exporting to mobile devices, RPG Maker MV is the most robust out of the pack. 

It has a few faults, namely a steeper learning curve than the advertisements tell you (circumvented easily just by testing things out and using tutorials) and that the exporting function is not built-in on the program itself and necessitates outside software to do so, as well as the Plugin Manager no longer allowing manual editting of the default code like the Script Editor did. For newbies this won't be a problem, but for people with a basic knowledge of code but not enough to make their own plugins/scripts, this can be a bit of a turnoff. Thankfully plugins can easily get around any of these things like scripts could in the past. Also, make sure to look through your folders when you download the software: for ease of mobile exporting, not all the resources are immediately added to the default project loading, though they are included in separate folders.

Thankfully these faults are few and the pros are many. More great resources, an easy-to-use database, and a much better character generator make for an inviting software. All of the functions of event scripting and database tinkering for the most part copy off of VX Ace as well with some changes so for veterans returning from the last installment, you'll adapt quickly and easily. Being able to have HD resolution and mobile export is also obviously a plus.

Overall verdict: if you love old-school RPGs and always wanted to make your own, look into this software. It's intuitive, robust, and surprisingly easy to use once you get down the basics. $80 might be a steep price tag, and so if that turns you away, wait for a sale or try out RPG Maker 2003 or XP, more invitingly priced at $20-25, but don't forget to come back here to MV to make a real powerhouse of a retro RPG. This software gives you all the tools to make it happen."

												DON'T BUY IT YET - DOESN'T FUNCTION AS ADVERTISED

Reasons:

 Lacks explicit HTML5-exporter. The advertising says that you can export to HTML5, but there's no explicit option to do so.
 Windows builds use node-webkit as a wrapper, but don't package/archive the resources like other HTML5 game design toolkits do. Instead it just leaves the assets out in the open. 
 Android-exporter just exports a HTML-file (with resources) - it doesn't actually package an APK. Other HTML5 toolkits take care of this for you, but RPG Maker MV doesn't.
 iOS-exporter just exports a HTML-file (with resources) - it doesn't actually package an IPA. Other HTML5 toolkits take care of this for you, but RPG Maker MV doesn't.
 No fullscreen - just maximizes window. Previous versions allowed you to boot the game in fullscreen by default, but this one doesn't. You have let the user know that they need to press F4.
 Windowed mode has letterbox. In other words, there are two black bars in windowed mode, instead of the window snapping to the game's viewport.
 Title screen has no quit option on Windows- and Mac builds. Users need to ALT+F4 in order to quit.
 Most of the assets are RMVX-defaults or based on RMVX-defaults.
Wait until they fix these issues.

EDIT: Clarified some of the points."

												Though I'm giving this a recommendation, I want to say first that this is not for every RPG Make user. It's quite likely your better off using Ace for now.

If things like a more accessible programing language, mobile and browser support, a more diverse set of stock graphics (it's not called RTP anymore), and a fancier character generator are things that interest you, then by all means go ahead.

If what's listed above don't catch your fancy, then I'm afraid to tell you the MV is not for you. At this point, there simply is not enough Pluggins to outdue the thousands of scripts Ace currently has.

The reason why I'm recommending this is the potential MV ultimately has, in the next year or so, I envision MV getting the proper updates it needs from the developers while getting the pluggins it needs from the community to create the ultimate RMing experince. It's just not like that now. And that's why it needs all the support it can get."

												I want to write an actual constructive review , but some people have already exposed the good and bad points in the review section . So , to make short :

Cons : 
_No RTP anymore , every new project will take the whole 400Mb to make , even for a little test thing
_Including outside content now requires to be done manually , while it could be done with a simple button inside the program in previous versions
_Same goes for script editing , the tool isn't here and you have to includes external scripts
_[NOTICED AND BEING FIXED BY DEVS] Changing the variable of status alterations makes the program crash . Devs are aware and fixing it .
(_I've also heard that converting games for android and all wasn't as easy as it was sadi

Now for the pros :
_Graphically fine , new Science-Fiction tilesets , graph and all are also a nice new elements , allowing to make decent utopian worlds 
_a GOOD character/face editor , with decent features unlike the horrible things that were predominant in VX Ace's one , also allowing you to put several characters in a simple sheet and to save samples
_Included 2d combat system (you could do that with scripts in VX for exemple , but I remember it used to crash sometimes , in here it's stable)
_Keeps all the usual features from other RPG makers , minus the ones described in the cons .
_Bigger default resolution for games , more detailed default sprites !
_That's a personal thinking , but the default musics included are better than before . (VX ones were good but VX Ace's were honestly ... idk , not as good ?)



It all depends what you're looking for . Saying it is easier than ever to make games sounds a bit like a lie considering how some of the options were removed , but all in all you still can do them by yourself , the base ressources are good , the char generator is very good and the side battle brings a refreshing change . Personally , I'm satisfied with my order !"

												Their loud & boisterous advertisement that tells you it's now possible to easily make a game that can easily be played on mobile is what reeled me in, hook, line, & sinker.  I've spent well over 100 hours using this now, creating the beginnings of my big game, only to find out, their export to mobile is not exporting to mobile.

The process required to convert a package that RMMV ""exported"" to ""mobile"" is still about another hours worth of work and 3 other programs away - and even then - you still run into performance issues from RMMV.

I wish I was eligible for a refund - I would request it immediately - but as I stated, I've poured  100+ hours into the use already - I should have tested the mobile capabilities up front.

There are much better engines out there - many of which are actually free - you just pay for the improved assets.  From now on, I'll save my $70 to spend on the assets of the more powerful, more affordable, much more capable game engines that actually do what they claim they can do."

		YouTube™ Video: [Review] RPG Maker MV vs VX Ace 
		
			Views: 4,311		
		
			Today we talk about the differences between RPG Maker MV and RPG Maker VX Ace. Basically, it's a review of MV and a comparison between the two most recent engines in the line of RPG Makers.		
	


MV's Pros
Because MV has Javascript behind it, the engine already has as many if not more plugins than VX Ace did. Now I have never used the engines that came before VX Ace- Ace was my first RPG Maker- but I can already tell you the differences are astounding.

Javascript gives you access to HTML and Canvas elements, which basically allows you to edit absolutely anything you can see. My partner managed to create something in the engine that took an entire scene, calculated what areas has the abilityto step on, and then spawned enemies in random spots any time the player entered the screen. This took him only a few hours.

If that doesn't impress you- and the sheer ease of making a plugin should, because it means you're not being held back from making something OTHER than a JRPG- then the beauty of the engine should. 

VX Ace was pretty. It allowed for some very nice looking sprites, lovely areas, and a fine amount of detail. MV spits on that and calls Ace ugly. 

MV's tiles and sprites have a good deal more room for detail and looks. I don't recall the exact size difference between the sprite sizes, but I can tell you the sheets are way bigger in resolution than Ace's. But the best part is you can still use VX Ace sprites in MV- in fact, there are ways and places on the internet that explain very simply how you can take your sprites from Ace and turn them into MV compatible sprites. Or you can just use Ace sprites. It works beautifully either way, so your old DLC isn't useless anymore.

AND there are now side battlers for your characters that MV generates in the character creator. Should you use them, that means your tiny 2D characters will be fully animated with correct weapon types based on equipment and attack the enemy. It's beautiful.

MV's Cons
One of the best parts of Ace was how beginner friendly it was. When you got the engine, it already had 92 billion spells set up for you, like 500 enemies and troops ready for deployment, and basic classes already filled out and calculated for gameplay. You could seriously just populate a scene and start a game right then and there.

MV doesn't have this.

The four classes it gives you are nearly all identical; you get four-five starter spells for exmple, and a really poor example. You have much nicer sprites for items and spells and weapons... But less. You have less options for customizing characters in the character creator (though the character faces look WAAAAAAAAY better). 

And my LEAST FAVORITE part:

Things that I felt should have been a part of the base engine were DLC.

When I got my DLC, I though perhaps I'd actually gotten an Update. It was very difficult to even sus out what the DLC even was, because it felt like it should have been in the engine to begin with. I got five extra face structures, a few new hair styles, and a couple different eyes and clothes, as well as a little music and (atcually quite a few) plugins.

The character creator stuff really should not have been DLC. It really shouldn't have been. Music, new sprite sheets for areas, plugins- those can count as DLC. But for a basic piece of the engine with so little that was given, the DLC felt a bit... Depressing.

Would I still buy MV if I didn't have it? Yes. Do I plan to return to Ace? Not on your life. I have it installed so I have easy access to its DLC."

												I'm really enjoying my time with MV, and find it the best maker yet. I've come from XP, to VX, to ACE and love all the improvements implemented in MV compared to them; especially now that MV is using Javascript, and includes the option for a sideview battle via a click of a button. Overall, there's so much to do, and the included resources give you enough to make your very own game, which you can then port to Android, iOS or even play it in your web browser via HTML5!

For the price, this really is the best bang for buck in RPG game development and whether you're young or old, it's always good to learn new skills and try a new hobby, this will teach you graphics and creativity, storytelling, javascript, mapping, puzzle building, problem solving and much more.

Give it a go! Happy RPGmaking!"

												I'm tried RPGmaker since RPGmaker XP age and i'm exited cause i can create my imagination into a game story. But the problem is the programing is difficult for me, and it's only support PC with low resolution so i stop it. But now in RPG maker MV we create higher resolution game and support multi platform device. It's make me very very exited.

Pro: 
Multi platform(desktop,web base,mobile)
Plugins easy to find or create it
The resource easy to create it
The community is good

Cons:
The game resource can easily be extraxted(plagiat)
The API or scripting is have not official tutorial or documentaion
Need many updates(because the interface n system are not too much different than older version)"

												I do recommend that you purchase this rpg maker over the last one RPG Maker Ace due to the updated graphics and there appears to be andriod and ios exports. The main reason I recommend this one is the resolution having the larger resolution makes the game look better.

Pros
Larger resolution
Icons for weapons
Icons for skills
Side view battles
Better Character Generator
Effects look better


Cons
More Expensive 
Less prebuilt Monsters (I believe RPG Maker Ace had alot more but I haven't confirmed)

*there are probably more but I can't think of any at this time.

Honestly if your looking to make an rpg of this style I would get this version over Ace just becuase it looks better and has the extra exports. If your looking to create a game for your phone or for steam, this is a good way to start. (Granted it may take awhile before you finish a game)"

												RPG Maker MV is the next implement of the RPG Maker franchise, a series of tools that allows you to create a classic RPG game. How that game is going to be made will be entirely up to you, enabling you to create the game you always dreamed of making. Starting off RPG Maker MV is an expensive tool set starting off at $79.99 and certain packs/DLC that follow suit are anywhere from $5.00-$20.00, which is a pretty expensive hobby overall. Once these have been purchased you are given a decent amount of starting resources to make a game. The tool itself is relatively easy to start using, but getting into scripts and how certain events work demands more advanced and seasoned users. While creating the game, you are given so many options from adding actors (the characters of your game), creating equipment, adding bosses and monsters, to states that will affect the combat, everything is up to your creative insight. The character creation tool makes its return again, but this time it feels like a much smoother system, characters created not only look better, but the sprites they produce also look pretty good. The system of creating events and maps remained more or less the same with a few new features, but overall the tool feels great. While some RPG Maker veterans will cling to the old, some will move onto the new and utilize this software to create awesome new titles that will either be sold on STEAM or remain only playable by the author.

PROS:
Loads of new resources and features
Pretty good starting music
Character creator enhanced
Allows you to create your own game
Easy to start off

CONS:
EXPENSIVE
Some features require more advanced users
Requires some of your older resources to be enlarged or changed to match the new standards."

												Overall it's a nice upgrade from VX Ace.

I've read lots of opinions and most (not all) of the negative ones are just based on complete ignorance and people expecting the program to actually make their games without moving a finger. The rest are people people having just different personal tastes or who bought the program without even knowing what it was about, what it could do, etc.

There are many pros and new additions, starting with the increase of resolution and being multiplatform.
It's very easy to use with lots of similarities with the older programs but the additions are cool. The character generator is a huge improvement from VX Ace.
Also there are already many plugins that fix some limitations, enhance them or add new possibilities to your games, which I think it's a PLUS and no reason to complain about (as many do).

There are some problems with the program itself but are mostly related with the rushed translations and will eventually be fixed.
The program may be expensive for some people, and it depends on the amount of time you'll spend with the program but I can surely say I recommend it."

												I've got basically everything I'm going to write below in a video format as follows:


	
	
		YouTube™ Video: [Review] RPG Maker MV vs VX Ace 
		
			Views: 4,311		
		
			Today we talk about the differences between RPG Maker MV and RPG Maker VX Ace. Basically, it's a review of MV and a comparison between the two most recent engines in the line of RPG Makers.		
	


MV's Pros
Because MV has Javascript behind it, the engine already has as many if not more plugins than VX Ace did. Now I have never used the engines that came before VX Ace- Ace was my first RPG Maker- but I can already tell you the differences are astounding.

Javascript gives you access to HTML and Canvas elements, which basically allows you to edit absolutely anything you can see. My partner managed to create something in the engine that took an entire scene, calculated what areas has the abilityto step on, and then spawned enemies in random spots any time the player entered the screen. This took him only a few hours.

If that doesn't impress you- and the sheer ease of making a plugin should, because it means you're not being held back from making something OTHER than a JRPG- then the beauty of the engine should. 

VX Ace was pretty. It allowed for some very nice looking sprites, lovely areas, and a fine amount of detail. MV spits on that and calls Ace ugly. 

MV's tiles and sprites have a good deal more room for detail and looks. I don't recall the exact size difference between the sprite sizes, but I can tell you the sheets are way bigger in resolution than Ace's. But the best part is you can still use VX Ace sprites in MV- in fact, there are ways and places on the internet that explain very simply how you can take your sprites from Ace and turn them into MV compatible sprites. Or you can just use Ace sprites. It works beautifully either way, so your old DLC isn't useless anymore.

AND there are now side battlers for your characters that MV generates in the character creator. Should you use them, that means your tiny 2D characters will be fully animated with correct weapon types based on equipment and attack the enemy. It's beautiful.

MV's Cons
One of the best parts of Ace was how beginner friendly it was. When you got the engine, it already had 92 billion spells set up for you, like 500 enemies and troops ready for deployment, and basic classes already filled out and calculated for gameplay. You could seriously just populate a scene and start a game right then and there.

MV doesn't have this.

The four classes it gives you are nearly all identical; you get four-five starter spells for exmple, and a really poor example. You have much nicer sprites for items and spells and weapons... But less. You have less options for customizing characters in the character creator (though the character faces look WAAAAAAAAY better). 

And my LEAST FAVORITE part:

Things that I felt should have been a part of the base engine were DLC.

When I got my DLC, I though perhaps I'd actually gotten an Update. It was very difficult to even sus out what the DLC even was, because it felt like it should have been in the engine to begin with. I got five extra face structures, a few new hair styles, and a couple different eyes and clothes, as well as a little music and (atcually quite a few) plugins.

The character creator stuff really should not have been DLC. It really shouldn't have been. Music, new sprite sheets for areas, plugins- those can count as DLC. But for a basic piece of the engine with so little that was given, the DLC felt a bit... Depressing.

Would I still buy MV if I didn't have it? Yes. Do I plan to return to Ace? Not on your life. I have it installed so I have easy access to its DLC."

												Should've been label early access.

The switch to javascript has given more power to creators but at the cost of performance.  Animated tiles flat out cause framerate drops in game.  Editor also exhibits this lagging behaviour when pasting tiles.  Output to any format is completely open for end users, so it isn't really compiled as such and instead opens up for complete/partial copies of any better games as soon as they are released.


On the plus side maps can be any size (with a script), resolution can be increased (with a script), in fact everything can be changed with javascript.

While it could be good it clearly isn't at the moment and should be treated as the early beta it really is."

												I first used RPG Maker Vx Ace a year or two ago and I love to use the software. Every graphical aspect of the games you make can be your own, and the features this version includes make it well worth the price. It's awesome to learn how RPGs work (I can explain how most RPGs work to my friends) by using this software. Even if you don't make money from the games you make, it's still a fun time to explore your creativity with RPG Maker MV. It's great to have Mac support, too."

												I'm in love with this. Absolutely. 100%.
I came to this one from RPGMaker XP because it was on sale, and I had wanted it for awhile. It was a HUGE step up, and I would have easily paid full-price for it and started using it months ago if I had known it was going to be this fun. After transitioning from XP, I figured I had a lot to learn, but learning the new UI it just became second-nature. I'm not sure about people comparing MV and Ace, as I have never used Ace, but it is easy enough to work around and I am still learning new things all the time. I'm only 39 hours into this RPGMaker, but the entire time has been spent on a single game that I was working on from XP. The tilesets leave much to be desired, as coming from XP there was a huge assortment, but there's enough there to work with without feeling like DLC is a must. Also, Workshop integration is nice. I haven't downloaded anything yet, but I think that with a little more time it might start filling up.

TL;DR- If you wanted to make RPG games, I'd say this would be a great first step, but you may think about picking up one of the cheaper titles to get a feel for how it all goes together. If this much was thrown at me at once going in blind like I did with XP, I probably would have given up."

												95% + of the complaints are peoples lack of ability and or information... 

This software does what it claims it does outside of the box as well as opens far more oppertunies and options then its predecessors. 

Note: The program plans to become better optimized when it upgrades its graphics engine from pixiv2 - pixi v4, so look out for that!

Update: PIXI.v4 is out, and increases preformance by a lot."

												Though I'm giving this a recommendation, I want to say first that this is not for every RPG Make user. It's quite likely your better off using Ace for now.

If things like a more accessible programing language, mobile and browser support, a more diverse set of stock graphics (it's not called RTP anymore), and a fancier character generator are things that interest you, then by all means go ahead.

If what's listed above don't catch your fancy, then I'm afraid to tell you the MV is not for you. At this point, there simply is not enough Pluggins to outdue the thousands of scripts Ace currently has.

The reason why I'm recommending this is the potential MV ultimately has, in the next year or so, I envision MV getting the proper updates it needs from the developers while getting the pluggins it needs from the community to create the ultimate RMing experince. It's just not like that now. And that's why it needs all the support it can get."

												I shall clarify I am a person who's spent over 2,000 hours in VX Ace, I have a VX Ace game on Steam (Close Your Eyes), and for my projects, most, if not all, of the assets are created by myself and a partner, so some of the issues people have with RTP stuff not coming until a later date don't bother me. What RPG Maker MV has done though is make a number of changes to the RPG Maker program that I'm loving.

I've spent 40+ hours in MV at the time of writing and have been making a little community Halloween game on a stream. Some of the changes to MV are very appreciated both from a developer and a player viewpoint. At first it seems quite similar to VX Ace, and indeed those who've spent a lot of time with Ace will probably immediately feel right at home, but the layout has been made overall easier, with new shortcuts around the window to access things easily and quicker, and the documentation included with MV is easy to find and more helpful and detailed than previous entries, in my opinion.

The first thing about anyone using the program compared to previous versions may notice, or anyone who's played RPG Maker games in general may notice, is that the default tiles and window resolution are much larger than previous entries (for a VX Ace comparison, VX Ace used 32x32 tiles, and the default window was 544x416, with the maximum resolution it could obtain being 640x480. Meanwhile, MV by default has 48x48 tiles and the tile sizes can be changed through scripting to any size you want really, and with a default resolution of 816x624, but can easily make HD resolutions and even reach 4k resolutions with some plug-ins if you really wanted to, though you'd need to design maps with that in mind ). And something I deeply appreciate on the user-side is now RPG Maker MV games can be resized manually; clicking the sides of the screen of an MV game will allow you to re-size the window, scaling the game to the window while also not ruining aspect ratio. Helpful for those in the past who hated the unchangably small window of past RPG Makers with only fullscreen as a usual alternative; now windows can be made any size manually.

Mapping is the next big thing people may notice a difference in compared to VX Ace. While Ace eliminated some of VX's mapping restrictions, MV basically abolishes VX Ace's restrictions in turn. You can now easily tile things from the B/C/D/E/etc tilesets over each other while mapping, and can via plug-ins make infinite layers and far higher sheets per tileset if you desire. And also as a result of the tiles being bigger, mapping also has gained an edge in ease, in my opinion.

To get this point out of the way: Plug-Ins. They're replacement to scripts in MV which use Javascript as opposed to Ruby (which the past iteration used), while MV needs time in the oven to have more publicly available plug-ins for the masses, how they are implemented are a lot better than scripting was, in my opinion. The restrictions on the engine being removed does aid this for more versatility, and the overall easier and more common language of Javascript is already doing wonders of accessible plug-ins and coding. There's definite promise this element will only grow with time and with people sharing their output. Being able to call, turn on and off, and easily modify Plug-Ins, as well as implement them into MV easier than scripts were to VX Ace, all help ease of use.

Speaking of ease of use, the ability to edit your game while play-testing is a huge time saver and helps the play-testing process immensely, as does being able to trigger and change variables, switches, and nodes easily while play-testing through the press of a button (press F8 while play-testing to access the developer console, F9 to access a menu to turn switches on/off).

Some misc notes on MV: The mouse/touch controls for MV are well-implemented and I've found myself using them while play-testing. Some small things, like events finally being able to easily walk over other events, are very much appreciated details. The audio system the game uses sounds a lot crisper to me than previous iterations, and the fade-out/pitch/other audio effects sound different compared to how VX Ace handled them, but I think they're an improvement. Also for some reason, the included RTP music in MV is really good, like leagues above previous iterations. There's a lot more music than usual, and they have much better production quality, and a lot of it is pretty catchy, actually. The plug-in to let users configure mouse/gamepad controls with full implementation is a godsend. On the RTP, it's also nice to no longer need to include it in exported files and raise game file sizes by a few hundred MBs.

And a huge draw for me behind the engine as well is it being easy to make a version for Mac computers, having friends and people asking for my previous games on Mac, this is appreciated. There's also HTML5 and Mobile support, but as of the time of writing they currently need a bit more work to get going, but not advanced knowledge to accomplish and the documentation on how is done well.

The multiple platforms, Javascript coding/Plug-Ins, and the resolution thing are probably the three biggest things for the engine, but a lot of the small touches to mapping/events/layering/audio and ease of use improvements have made this a very positive experience for myself thus far.

I've heard some have been having slow-down issues, if they can sort that out for people with the problem then we'll be perfect, and those who use the RTP will be happy when the full RTP collection is eventually released later, but I have to say this has been an improvement in a number of ways over VX Ace for me, and I plan to switch full on to this from Ace."

												This is the first Rpg maker software I've gotten. I went into this blind and spent the first hour or so not knowing what the hell I was doing. So I went to youtube and watched some videos on how everything worked. Once you understand how everything works its a nice piece of software. So If you are new to this like I was i recomend heading to youtube to learn all the intricies. I watched SumRndmDde's videos he has, at this point, 30 videos running through everything from map making to animations and switchs/varibles. I'd recomend him as a starting off point. For plugins, which are extensions that you can add to manipulate the base software in different ways,  I reccomend looking up YanFly, tons of free plugins to make your game different from a base rpg maker mv game.  If It's on sale I'd say go for it, full price may be a bit much however, I'd say wait until it's on sale"

												Disclaimer: I would rather have a neutral option for this, I don't think RPG Maker MV is bad.


Well, this is a tough one. RPG Maker definitely improved in many aspects and the fact that they changed to JS rather than Ruby is huge for multiplatform support. Also the Plugin system makes it far easier to add scripts and makes many things easier.

That's kind of the thing. It makes things easier, but MV has only few things that it can do that previous installments couldn't. There are many sophisticated scripts for VXAce and while this program is still in a state where it will eventually catch up. This isn't a huge deal but it should be considered.

Now here is a few things that RPG maker MV did absolutely wrong:
-Sideview Battlers and Frontview Battlers are identical, meaning that you can't use the sideview sprites for generated characters as opponents in sideview battle even though just flipping the sprites would do the trick. You will have to actually change the sprites and code in the animations yourself.
-Adding a lot of entries (100+) to the database eventually makes it ridiculously slow. No other installment had ever problems with load times.
-The terrain brush also experiences lag, making it harder to accurately paint with it.
-The character generator is split in male and female and with many parts (like smiling mouths or headbands) that absolutely makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense. Trying to merge the parts or just modify the generator will cause it to malfunction spectacularly.
-Many of the promised features and assets are actually parts of DLC/user content and not actually part of the main game.


Essentially, I would suggest people to wait until the most glaring mistakes have been ironed out and the scripters and asset creators have created enough content to warrant switching over from the old RPG Makers. If you don't yet own an RPG maker, I would wait for a sale or maybe opt for VX Ace before paying the rather steep price for this program."

												This is a huge disappointment in the otherwise good RPG Maker series. The character editor is a joke compaired to VX Ace, and a lot of very handy things from VX Ace were just dropped, and should not have been. For instance, they eliminated the ""insert"" command. This makes you have to do the whole event over if you forgot to put something in.....very bad and time consuming. Also, the included items, actors, statuses, etc were only a fraction of what was included in VX Ace. Yes, the side battle  system and a couple of other features are good, but the whole experience feels chunky and out of place. This game had the hype of The Witcher 3 and Fallout 4.....with the deliverance of ""Hello Kitty"". If this steam version were not free because I purchased ahead of time at the home site....I would have been twice as upset. I just cannot reccommend this game over VX Ace, no matter how much better the graphics are."

												Back to the days I wrote my first game in RPG Maker 2000, the system was the best game maker. Without any programming knowledge, developers were able to build a great rpg games. 

I remembered I abandoned development on RM after RPG Maker XP start working with RGSS. It was flexible, but somehow I felt the scripting language was not modern and will be removed someday.

Now RPG Maker MV fully replaced RGSS with Javascript and it also support plugins, which greatly extend engine features.
After 10+ years of time, I purchased MV just for supporting the developers. Thanks Enterbrain.
I don't think I will create a game via RPG Maker MV. but I am willing to check out any new games made with MV."

												First, I'm just excited this has finally come to Mac.  It's great to have as somebody that hasn't played around with other RPG Makers, besides the ones on PSX and PS2.  So I can't speak to what's improved or worsened from VX, etc.:  I'm just excited I have something rather than nothing, so I give it a 10/10 on that front alone, in addition to being able to port to Android and iOS.

Second, I really enjoy this software.  The base assets are great for someone who doesn't want to map, draw, or make their own sounds/music.  Sideview is very cool.  The whole thing looks great, sounds great, plays great.  I really have no idea where the lag complaints are coming from:  I have no lag or loading times between things, but maybe that's because I'm not intentionally trying to create 99999x99999 tile boards like some people are trying.

Things are generally easy to ""code"" and put together in that it is very WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get.)  I use this software at my afterschool program to teach STEM concepts so I can say that even Middle Schoolers can get a grasp of things fairly soon if you give them some direction.  Plugins seem to really give you the ability to unlock the full potential of everything, but I am no expert and have only tried to the ""plug this in to change this"" simple plugins.  I have not created anything complex.

TL;DR:  Buy this if you're on a Mac.  Buy this if you want to create something that looks very high-end with not much effort.  Buy this is you're teaching coding to kids."

												I have been away from RPG Maker for a long time and not used to seriously since XP, I did however like the look of MV so much that I bought it and I can safely say I am not disappointed. This is without a doubt the best version of the engine to date, the increased tile size, resolution and ability to make battles side view by default really make the software shine. 

Will this convert people who don't like RPG maker? No, but if you had even a passing interest in the previous iterations this is without a doubt worth a purchase as making your own old school style jrpg has never been so much fun.

On the subject of the dlc, I never bought the pre order version so I paid for them separately and although I was petty happy with both packs I thought the cover art one to be much better value. The characters included are very unique and have that Final Fantasy magic meets sci-if vibe to them. The music included is also excellent."

												Like JRPGS? Want to make one? Cant afford to buy a fancy engine, to pay artists, programmers, and marketing guys? SICK WE HAVE THIS COOL PRODUCT!
Pros: 
Plugin system is super easy and comes with a bunch for controller support stc.
Easy to use, well documented tools for creating your own stories!
EXPORT TO MOBILE DEVICES! :D
Comes with free art you can use comercially! 
Easy set up for Side by side, or front view battles!
Comes with a basic outline of items/weapons/monsters so you can figure out how things work!

Cons:
Exporting to mobile devices takes a LOT of reading.
All of th eprevious art for RPG Maker games are useless because of their lower resolution (Kinda  a good thing?)
$80 (Keep in mind I have never actually paid full price for an RPG Maker title (mostly through sales) so I have no idea if it is a typical release price)

TL;DR
I like it more than I like the past entries and I have spent almost 12 hours so far just playing with all of the new stuff so I could write this review!

Edit: DLC's are LIT"

												A little disapointed but recommend if you can get it on sale.

The engine seems good but some basic things should have been done better. 

Cons:

*There should have been more monsters included without having to buy DLC. 
A matter of fact this engine is a DLC ♥♥♥♥♥. Seriously look at the amount of DLC there is and how much the total cost of all of it is. Insane!!!!
*Adding the DLC is a tedious process. You have to drag and drop all of the files into each folder manually....for EACH project.
*The tilesets arent bad but should have been expanded more. However the building tiles are improving.
*needs a sortable search feature for plugins.

Pros:

*Got it on sale
*The tilesets that are included are nice
*quick events
*javascripting/plugins
*resolution
*ability to deploy to android or ios (youtube how, it isnt hard)
*quick and easy to use and learn
*Lots of community help from other users"

												Given my time that is continuously invested in RPG Maker MV, I felt that it would be fitting to weigh in my opinions on the software.

One could essentially say that RPG Maker MV is an enchanced overhaul on what was VX Ace. While that would be over-simplifying things, I would agree for the most part. Granted, not everything makes a perfect transition and there are a few oddities here and there with MV. On the whole, though? This was worth *every* penny to me, just as VX Ace was. Note that while I love MV, I am not at all saying that VX and VX Ace are ""obsolete"". People are still making games with them, after all. 

One of the first things you might notice (particularly if you are another ol' VX Ace user like me) is that games are graphically improved upon and a bit more defined. But this is only the surface of what MV has to offer. In many ways, customization has never been easier. There are many nifty convenient shortcuts added in to help with those ""repetitive database moments"" when making large games in past versions. Then there is also the option of having a Side View Battle system (along with the standard Front View that most of us know all too well). While there are a few ""little things"" that I wish I could tweak with ease, these are nitpicks. If you can think of a feature you dream up for a game, it's highly probable that you can see it manifest with MV (or find/create plugins that assist in that regard). 

You don't really *need* programming knowledge (although it definitely doesn't hurt to have it). What users ""need"" is a general idea or theory of how games work ""behind the scenes"", so-to-speak. Even if you don't really have that, learning it is relatively simple with time and experimentation put into projects and experiments. I can't tell you how many times I've been on a given idea for a feature only to dream up other ideas and play around with the software's tools just to see if it could work. So even with virtually little to no programming experience and with just ""RPG Maker experience"" (like myself), users can really do quite a bit with this. Also, as others here say, plugins can definitely be a way of taking your creations to the next level.

My only (constructive) criticism of MV? I know it's something that they are working on even now, but I feel that game deployment & data usage could use a bit more improvement in some areas. However... while there is the occasional derp, it is worth mentioning that deploying is not the buggy nightmare it once was. So, that's a huge improvement in my book. Given that I've been playing with this since its release (and given how far its come along), I must say I'm fairly optimistic about its growth through recent and future updates. If you've got the imagination, plenty of hours to kill and that itch to make a game under your own vision... I would honestly recommend RPG Maker MV. 

Edit: I've been asked a few times on my thoughts on MV's Season Pass and other resources for purchase on Steam. I do not have Season Pass, but I would recommend RPG Maker MV by itself first (to see if you like it) before deciding on purchasing a bunch of additional resources."

												This software has been getting an undeserved amount of flak in these reviews; in my honest opinion having played around with VX Ace and XP (not all on steam however), this is probably the most powerful RPG Maker yet.

Pros:-Javascript. I know a lot of people are upset about it having very little compatibility with Ruby like the last RPG Makers, but these new Javascript plugins are insanely powerful. Earlier today I met someone who was able to get their project sending data back and forth to an online server, something no RPG maker game has *ever* been able to do in the past. It may be far too taxing to develop an actual online RPG Maker game, but online features to some extent are a definite possibility now, and that's great. Moreover, Javascript is a much more commonly-used language than Ruby ever was, and there are no more hidden classes limiting the scope of scripts, and far fewer hard-coded limitations.

-Plugin manager to easily import and control your plugins. Keep in mind that script order does still matter, but the only way to move plugins up or down is to cut and paste them elsewhere in the list. ""Move Plugin Up or Down"" buttons are not included.

-All of the same features of VX Ace, plus larger tile size and screen resolution and a smarter map-editor. Or, if you don't want the larger sizes, you can go back to 32x tiles and the smaller res of VX Ace with some of the preorder javascript plugins, all of which you can find online for free with the same terms of use if you did not preorder.



Cons:-Clarity. This is the biggest reason for the number of negative reviews. The developers of the software have not been as clear in communicating their product's features as they could have. For instance, they advertised android/iOS porting, and people assumed they would be getting an automated tool that did everything for them. However, this is not the case, and falls on both the end user's expectations and the company failing to clarify that only a simple step-by-step guide would be provided for this purpose, rather than an automated too.

-[Pending an update] Day One problems. There aren't lots of pre-made database entries out of the box. As I understand it, the game was released in English before everything was fully localized, so the starting database has very little pre-made content to use. However, all of the resources to make content are there. And the pre-order DLC is in the install folder, giving even more content. The developers intend to update this and fully complete the localization in the future. Moreover, some are getting weird performance errors the developers didn't expect. Again, they intend to fix as many of these issues as they can.

-No resource manager. This might be a turn off for some, because it was such a nice feature of VX Ace, but I feel this isn't a major issue.



Overall:This is overall the best RPG Maker iteration yet, mostly because of the more open feel to scripting, and the great amount of documentation for the features of the engine and the javascript methods to use, all by pressing F1 in the editor to open the expansive help page. Moreover, the preorder plugins made by yanfly and so many others all have documentation of their own, with Yanfly having made tens of videos going in-depth on tips and tricks to do with their plugins and how to best use everything that's there."

												Disclosure: I spent 700+ hours in RPG Maker VX Ace, and I pre-ordered via the official website.

So, I've been developing a game in VX Ace; and now I decided to move on to MV after pre-ordering it (forgive me), and I gotta say; this is actually a great program. Awesome to see sideview battlers integrated within the game, although I wish enemies had their own sideview animations so it's more like Final Fantasy VI.

Pros:
-Great first program.
-Awesome, more improved generator.
-Pre-order DLC is glorious.
-A higher resolution.
-Move to Javascript, which means no more using an unfamiliar language or having to learn a whole new language. This will certainly welcome in some new developers who are also learning Javascript.
-Plugins. You can still edit them with Notepad/Notepad++ but I find the plugin system nice, as you can now edit things without worrying about editing this one line of code ♥♥♥♥ing up your game or making it do a CTD.
-Same interface RM users are very familiar with, which means RMMV is welcoming for newcomers and veterans alike.
-More things to spice up.
-Great base/DLC soundtrack and graphics. Some songs even give the Hotline Miami/Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon vibe.
-Addition of an options menu, even featuring the ability to turn down music and sound. Yanfly also made plugins for customizing controls, thank god; as WASD > Arrow Keys.

Cons:
-Smaller database than VX Ace. This should be a non-issue if you like building things yourself. (UPDATE: You can download the full database here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17078211/RMMV_data.rar )
-Character generator gradients kinda suck. You can edit the gradients with Paint.NET/PhotoShop/GIMP; which I've done later on. Non-issue if you plan to use custom graphics.
-Lack of native true Linux support. Granted, Android is based off of Linux and Crosswalk exists but still.
-Older computers should stay away for now.
-VX Ace to MV converter is kinda not worth it, I just converted some of my databases over and started from scratch.
-Removal of formula generators when setting damage.
-No exiting to desktop integrated, but http://steamcommunity.com/app/363890/discussions/3/483368526580177984/ - Fixes this issue.
-Some plugins need to be installed to fix some flaws.
-Lack of FLAC and MP3. MP3 is no longer supported but you can convert to OGG easily with Audacity.

Score: 9.0/10. MV is, despite its flaws improved over VX Ace.  I do hope more is added but I'm pretty satisfied with it; and I hope to see it improve as it develops."

												I took a punt on this as I haven't played any of the previous games. Scratches that creative itch. If you can think of something you'd like to do it's generally possible to find a way. Wish it came with more assets, but it's not hard to source more yourself - or create them."

But the problem is the programing is difficult for me, and it's only support PC with low resolution so i stop it. But now in RPG maker MV we create higher resolution game and support multi platform device. It's make me very very exited.

Pro: 
Multi platform(desktop,web base,mobile)
Plugins easy to find or create it
The resource easy to create it
The community is good

Cons:
The game resource can easily be extraxted(plagiat)
The API or scripting is have not official tutorial or documentaion
Need many updates(because the interface n system are not too much different than older version)"

												I've recieved this product as a gift- and I have to say, it's the one of the best things I've ever got.

This is a very early review considering I haven't fully delved into the application 100%. It will take a lot of time and patience. Not just one or two or ten hours. This will take houndrets of hours. But with enough practice and experience you'll get while using this engine- Anyone can make a great game from this if they meet a set criteria. 

It may be really frustrating from the beginning when you have no idea and you'e literally just browsing through menus and trying to find out what to do and what's going on. It'll take you some hours to figure out how does some things works. once you'll watch couple tutorials, it'll become much easier than on the beginnig. I haven't played loads of it but from the around 10 hours I have spent currently on one project I have learnt many new things that I would've never learnt in a video or in the manual. Its simple and familiar look makes it easily accessible to people who have already used any of the previous engines, but is really approachable to people new to it as well. It contains a lot of features, things you can edit, things you can create on your own. It isn't only map creator and character generator. I've been focusing on character creation, creating classes, skills, items, weapons, all of the above. Like the tagline says: Simple enough for a child, powerful enough for a developer. That tagline 100% applies to the software. If you want to make your game better and create something amazing, you must go through a lot of struggle, manuals and tutorials, but that applies to all of the game engines.
Over $90 for the base game isn't worth it if you are just going to mess around for a short amount of time so if you're really interested in game engines, creating RPG's, just go for it. 
This is not a game you play from time to time, it's not something you'd turn on and play for two hours and then get bored with it. This takes a lot of trial and error to get it to make the magic more experienced users can do.

I'll probably add more things to this review as the time pass, but all I can say for now is-
RPG Maker MV is great, simply amazing engine full of opportunities."

												When they say you can do anything you want in this maker, all it it takes is a little experience and practice. But you don't even need to do any fancy stuff! You can create a story driven game easily from the tools they provide; but if you want extra stuff, like a new battle system, like Final Fantasy X or VII, it's as easy as finding the resource, clicking save as and uploaing it...most are just plug in an play. Their are variety of resources on the web for free to modify your game. This is by far the bet community I've seen...they just always offer free stuff on the forums! 

Not only that, this program is amazing. It's fast, simple, and easy to use...and while it has a learning curve for more advanced options, you don't need coding to do it! Just read..and try and practice. You can do almost anythign with this program and I don't feel like its on the expensive side at all."

Only negative so far is the price. Very steep for something like this."

												WARNING. LONG REVIEW TL;DR AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION

So. You want to create a RPG and maybe even sell it? You're in the right place. 
First thing you want to know. It's not going to be easy. I mean, it's ""easy"" to learn and even easier if you have programming related knowledge but you still need creativity + to spend tons of hours investigating about the Maker and playing around with the Maker. So be prepared to take some basic programming courses (Or at least search what it's a flowchart and how they work).

Let's assume that by this point you know the basics of the Maker and you've might or not finished your first ""game"".
You've may noticed that the resources of this Maker (as awesome as they are) are... somewhat limited. Maybe you want to make your game more awesome or maybe you want more control of what you can do inside the Maker . Fear not young enthusiast, the Internet is here to save you.

With enough Google-fu you'll find resources (Generator Parts, Sprites, Tilesets, Music, Pictures, Plugins) that will make your game look and function better (Hail ol' mighty forums!) .

If your intention is to create a game for the fun of it or just to show it to your friends you'll find yourself looking at the ""Free for non commercial use"" or ""Free for non commercial use with credits"" lines in the resources. What does that mean? It means you can use those resources without the need of giving money or asking for them.
Now, the thing is...if you go for a Commercial Release (A.K.A Wanting to make $ with your game) you'll find youself searching for the ""Free for commercial use"" line if you don't want to spend a cent in resources or buying them if you really feel like your game would need those resources if that message is not there.

Alternatively, if you have the skills (And Will) to create your own and unique game (Using your own resources) you can do it + learning JavaScript will help you to code your own plugins if you don't like the current ones or it just happened that there's no plugin that does what you want to do.

TL;DR: LEARN, EXPERIMENT AND DO IT

Now, onto the final part of the review. Why you should buy this Maker? 

Pros:
+ JavaScript 
+ Export to Android, MAcOS, iOS and Web (HTML5)
+ Actual Character Generator that doesn't make Lovecraftian beings like VX Ace
+ Your game can now be in HD
+ Mouse support (You can move with clicks and stuff)
+ A better map editor (Now with 3 layers!)
+ Side-view Battle (Now you can see your character fight!)
+ Tons of plugins being made as you read this
+ Super friendly community (As long as you ACTUALLY took the time to read the basics, don't be THAT guy/girl)

Cons:
- Export to Android, MAcOS, iOS 
While the game provides you the instructions to do this it's not precisely click and export like that. It it kinda tedious to do all that, just a warning. 
*HTML5 isn't like that, you just literally drop your game in a host and you'll be able to play it.
- JavaScript?  (Wait, what? Didn't you just said that this was a good thing?)
It is a good thing. If you know JavaScript or this is your first Maker. But for others that've been using Ruby from previous Makers it isn't. There might be people that think this change was for good, there might be others that do not believe so. (I believe  this change was for good)
Note: This doesn't mean that you can't make an awesome game in previous Makers. Just that some scripts from previous Makers might not be available if the autor did not transform them into JavaScript
- Not enough Character Generator parts
*This might've been a problem when the Maker came out, but since that, tons of resources have been made in order to satisfy the mayority. Netherless the problem was there once.

Welp. That's it. It's up to you to decide if this Maker is the ideal for you. Have fun making games!"

												Overall it's a nice upgrade from VX Ace.

I've read lots of opinions and most (not all) of the negative ones are just based on complete ignorance and people expecting the program to actually make their games without moving a finger. The rest are people people having just different personal tastes or who bought the program without even knowing what it was about, what it could do, etc.

There are many pros and new additions, starting with the increase of resolution and being multiplatform.
It's very easy to use with lots of similarities with the older programs but the additions are cool. The character generator is a huge improvement from VX Ace.
Also there are already many plugins that fix some limitations, enhance them or add new possibilities to your games, which I think it's a PLUS and no reason to complain about (as many do).

There are some problems with the program itself but are mostly related with the rushed translations and will eventually be fixed.
The program may be expensive for some people, and it depends on the amount of time you'll spend with the program but I can surely say I recommend it."

												Are you serious ? This just went on sale the day after I bought it. Can I get a refund? wait.. oh no I've already spent 9 hours. SERIOUSLY? HAHA YOU THINK IT'S A JOKE RIGHT?,NO! You will never understand my feeling until you are on the same situation with me. D:

Reviews(my anger may affect the reviews):

Pros:
-Things are easier with JavaScript.
-You can encrypt your game's file (datas like pictures)
-Easily port to other platform(with built-in manual).
-Resolutions are better than the last version. You can freely change the size of the window.
-Built-In Character generator (for newbies)

Cons:
-It's like the XP,VX ACE Combined and Remastered
-No changes in the events' menu at all
-Everything is pretty much the same without community-made Plugins(for example : Yanfly Stuffs changes the way RPGMAKER Games look like)
-THE PRICE?! NO Why? 50% off the day right after I bought for the FULL PRICE. Are you kidding me? heh

Conclusion:
Everyone can use this engine easily. You can make everything ,with the plugin. The changes of the script is really big. Few people knows Ruby but now It's JavaScript which is easier and wider. Easy Interface.
PreMade Maps,Tilesets are good.
,So
.
.

 I DON'T Recommend this product UNLESS It's on SALE(Just Kidding) 
The Product: 8/10(As I said above,It's like the XP,VX ACE Combined and Remastered) 
Worth It?: 6/10(Too expensive for kiddos)(If I take my anger on this It would be -10/10)

												It is nice, but I would feel better about the purchase if it had come with more tilesets and generator assets. It would also be nice if it was easier to add new resources. At the moment you have to re-number/name them by hand and make sure they go into the correct places yourself. It's not overly difficult, it just gets irritating when you are adding multiple resources. The program itself is easy to use and understand. My only real complaint is as stated above. I would like more RTP resources included and an easier/faster way to add your own resources. Overall it's decent, but their is certainly room for improvement. The only reason I'm giving this a thumbs up is because the community they have built on the rpgmaker forums is super helpful and supportive. It really makes this program shine over it's competitors."

												Positives:

1- It's resolution is unlocked (Altought you need plugins like Yanfly's Core plugin to anable them for example).

2- Plugin system makes it easier to avoid errors for people who don't know how to code but  want to use someone else's code.

3- It brings features back from RPG Maker 2003 like the sideview battles and event chasing, making this engine like a fusion between RPG Maker VX Ace and RPG Maker 2003.

4- Using Javascript may bring in more coders since it's a more known language than Rubyscript.

5- Assets resolution got increased along with the characters etc. Included sprites are 48x48 for example.

Negatives:

1- This is not a $80 USD egine since outside of the returning features from 2003 and the higther resolution, it's mainly just  a improved version of RPG Maker VX Ace. Most of the value comes from what the community's coders had done and not Enterbrain (Yanfly's Core Engines for example) yet each new engine costs $10 USD more than the previous.  Get this on a steam sale like I did.

2- The Automatic layering is a improvement over VX Ace but I want full control of the layers like I had on RPG Maker XP. This is the only thing that I miss the most of XP. I don't know why they removed this feature.

3- There's not options to make a full scrolling over world map. Many go around this by placing a bunch of teleporters around the map but it shoud not be this way, it should scroll giving the world the form of a donut like RPGs had been in the past. I don't even think it's possible for coders to add this functionality by making a Map Core script.

Conclusion:

This is the strongest of all the PC RPG Maker egines ever released and the only one who can support HD resolutions. (A core plugin is requiered.) Since it's new it will take a while before it is as supported as VX ACE but it is slowly reaching there. Also to get assets you may want to subscribe to their principal page. There's also some resources here on Steam as well, so just browse around.

If I where to rate this game, I would give it 8/10  or 3.5/5"

												This program isn't able to create an .apk file for android.
You just get the files, you have to create an .apk with additional software (python + java + android SDK + several different steps to do) by YOURSELFE.
This iformation is shown in the help (F1) at the point: ""Documentation -> Converting to an Android App"".

For a 70€ program that says in the advertisement that you can build an RPG easy for android and so on (for children), it isn't!

Because I get more and more answers to my review which say: ""you didn't expect to have to download the Android SDK and required tools for compiling to the Android platform?""
No I didn't, because the publisher of this product present his software like: supporting and create games for android / iOS, easy for a child. It isn't said that you need additional software. IT's shown as you have to click on a button to compiling to an android / iOS app."

												Firstly, let me say I put in a total of two hours into this. I've been focusing on character creation, creating classes, skills, items, weapons, all of the above! This software starts you bare bone, so you'll have alot of time being invested in your hands. The good part about it? It's as simple and basic as Ace.

Not sure where these bad reviews are coming from, but I'm assuming by those who want the gold platter place in front of them and expect no work or effort being done what so ever. Truth is, in game development, even something basic such as this, you'll never have that gold platter. You're either an artistic person or creating a video game isn't your style. Simple as that.

I can see myself involving this project i'm currently developing for nearly two years, depending how quick the DLC rolls in and how quick Yanfly operates those scripts. Good part is that this is run off Javascript, so that language won't be hard to translate due to knowing C#. Hopefully, I'm able to adjust a few things here and there.

There is one con though, and that's the lack of art introduced to the software. The detail on the monsters are really ugly, and it's a good thing I was able to transport all the art from ACE into this, and surprisingly, the art isn't oversize nor out of place. At first, the SV on my battlers side look extremely small, but I look back at games like FF4 that had the same problem. It's something easy to overcome. But I just hope MV will have better looking monsters than it does now, otherwise might as well stick with ACE art style for the mean time.

It's good software, and I hope it'll last for quite a while. Yes, it has some bugs and lag, but this software just came out. Nothing is 100% perfect off the bat. Play any game todays age. Just be grateful they can be updated over time, comparison to games back then that couldn't be updated. :)"

												Hot-Fix:

For those experiencing crashing or freezing when trying to change the parameters in the traits-window; there's a bug related to the software not being able to distinguish between the "","" and the ""."" properly which causes some sort of havok. 

You'll need to alter your computers ""idea"" of what the decimal symbol is like, and make it correspond with ""."" in RPG Maker MV since it thinks the decimal = ""."" and not the "","".

To do this, flip up your control panel and click ""Formats, Location, Keyboards and Languages"" or ""Administrative"". Choose ""Region and Language"" and ""Additional settings"". Then change the ""Decimal"" from "","" to ""."". 

After this gets fixed, you can revert back to normal to avoid any further problems with software designed for European computers/input methods."

												RPG Maker MV Reviewby KTMboyz

""Simple enough for a child, powerful enough for a developper""

I dumped a good couple hundred hours into RPGMaker VX Ace and don't regret it all!  I showed myself how it worked, made tons of mistakes and learned from each and every one.  When I heard the next one was coming out; I preordered it right away!  When I finally got my hands on it, I wasn't dispointed.  RPG Maker MV really does make it easier to create an RPG without programming. The biggest thing that I enjoyed was the side-view battle screens, in VX Ace, you would have to script that...  MV does alot more that couldn't do in previous installments (or would have to script).  The Plugin system is cool, the new screen resolution is great and being able to script with Java are all great examples of how MV has evolved over VX Ace.  People are complaining about the crappy default graphics, but I make my own so I don't care :)  I do think it is a bit overpriced but try it out, it's a lot of fun!"

												When they say you can do anything you want in this maker, all it it takes is a little experience and practice. But you don't even need to do any fancy stuff! You can create a story driven game easily from the tools they provide; but if you want extra stuff, like a new battle system, like Final Fantasy X or VII, it's as easy as finding the resource, clicking save as and uploaing it...most are just plug in an play. Their are variety of resources on the web for free to modify your game. This is by far the bet community I've seen...they just always offer free stuff on the forums! 

Not only that, this program is amazing. It's fast, simple, and easy to use...and while it has a learning curve for more advanced options, you don't need coding to do it! Just read..and try and practice. You can do almost anythign with this program and I don't feel like its on the expensive side at all."

Pros:1. Perfect mouse input
2. You can set the side-view battle easily
3. A better character generator
4. Larger tiles (48x48px)
5. OS X support
6. Intuitive plugin setup
7. OMG Javascripptttt

Cons:1. OMG Javascripptttt
2. DAT IN-GAME LAG (expecially for multiple parallel events).
3. DAT TRANSLATIONS. Now I'm using it in English (it's better than the other languages where you can't understand)
4. Exporting your game for other platform is... not simple enough. But It's still a new feature.
4. If you exaggerate with the window resolution, there will be some problem with the one-click pathfinding."

												I've spent extensive hours in this program and I absolutely love it.  Out of the box it is very simple to create fan games with little experience.  If you want to make a polished game it will take a bit more work, but the program offers you tools to accomplish that.  With the inclusion of Javascript over Ruby, it is far easier to both create your own plugins, or use other people's created plugins.

The program has the potential to put out quality games in the JRPG and action adventure genre, and with Javascript you could potentially spread this to other Genres as well.  

overall, this is a worthwhile purchase if you have an interest in making games but are intimidated by bigger engines like Cryengine or Unreal engine, or you just want to make a fan JRPG / professional JRPG."

												Their loud & boisterous advertisement that tells you it's now possible to easily make a game that can easily be played on mobile is what reeled me in, hook, line, & sinker.  I've spent well over 100 hours using this now, creating the beginnings of my big game, only to find out, their export to mobile is not exporting to mobile.

The process required to convert a package that RMMV ""exported"" to ""mobile"" is still about another hours worth of work and 3 other programs away - and even then - you still run into performance issues from RMMV.

I wish I was eligible for a refund - I would request it immediately - but as I stated, I've poured  100+ hours into the use already - I should have tested the mobile capabilities up front.

There are much better engines out there - many of which are actually free - you just pay for the improved assets.  From now on, I'll save my $70 to spend on the assets of the more powerful, more affordable, much more capable game engines that actually do what they claim they can do."

												This is a huge disappointment in the otherwise good RPG Maker series. The character editor is a joke compaired to VX Ace, and a lot of very handy things from VX Ace were just dropped, and should not have been. For instance, they eliminated the ""insert"" command. This makes you have to do the whole event over if you forgot to put something in.....very bad and time consuming. Also, the included items, actors, statuses, etc were only a fraction of what was included in VX Ace. Yes, the side battle  system and a couple of other features are good, but the whole experience feels chunky and out of place. This game had the hype of The Witcher 3 and Fallout 4.....with the deliverance of ""Hello Kitty"". If this steam version were not free because I purchased ahead of time at the home site....I would have been twice as upset. I just cannot reccommend this game over VX Ace, no matter how much better the graphics are."

												This has to be the best 2d engine I've ever used for creating rpg games, its easy to use and also really powerful for making more complex games. The visual interface is really easy to use for creating items and maps and placing npc's all around the map, but it also comes with a really great event system that lets you create more complicated things like cutscenes and dungeon puzzles without having to do any coding.

Its been a while since rpg maker was this good (last one I liked was rpg maker xp) but rpg maker mv finally brings back the side view option for battles and it now supports more platforms like mac, browser and mobile for releasing your game on the app stores.

Plugin support is already pretty good with lots of custom menu and battle tweaks, although theres no action battle system plugins yet like there was for past rpg makers so you can't make a zelda like game just yet, but the rpg maker community is already putting out tons of content and tutorials to make working with this engine really easy.

This is the first time since rpg maker xp I can highly recommend this engine, rpg maker mv is better then ever before."

												Summarily, my YES recommendation is ONLY if you're going to actually make a game - great. If you're just looking to get involved with programming and see this as a simple entry point at low cost - this isn't what you're actually looking for.  Many people purchase this and realize that it's not strictly drag and drop despite the WYSIWYG editor and that 85% of the time, you'll need to spend more money and or get at least a small team of people to complete a game (depending on the sieze and scope).  Though RPG Maker has what you need to make a game, it lacks enough of anything to make a substantive game and you'll either spend as much time or money making or buying assets as you would using a more diverse engine like Constructor 2 or Unity. 

*****************************************************************************************************

YOU WILL DO WELL TO BE AWARE much of the included content is not enough to make a game many people would play / buy. In fact, many of the included resources nad DLC suffer from a visual and quality inconsistency that they're not worth using beyond learning materials. So far, most of the season pass content is piecemeal and doesn't actually add to the core content either - it's so far been different art style avatars, a few music loops, and some sprites that inevitably become unused or overused by the userbase. 

*****************************************************************************************************

That said, if you're familiar with RPG Maker, MV comes with bittersweet changes. JavaScript replaces Ruby and the pixel diemnsions of sprites and tiles increased which means old assets cant be used without manual conversion.

I just can't figure out why the choice was to go with JS given RPG Maker touts itself as something for people to learn and build games quickly. IMO, Python would be a much better option under those pretenses.

There is a supportive community, but it's split. Some have been afraid to jump over to MV because it means they'll need to recreate all their assets but several communities exist exclusively for MV and have very friendly and helpful people. 

Pros (some of them a double-edged sword)

JavaScript is a popular frontend code used by many for mobile developent and is relatively approachable for new or non scripters. Still worse and less approachable than Python, by far.

Fairly easy to get started and produce something to play around in (not play, but get a good idea on how to be part of a team to work on something worthy).  

Several communities exist full of helpful people willing to impart wisdom regarding use and development. 

Resolution supportrs larger screens.



Cons:

Despite JavaScript being a positive, it's also a negative. It's complex in syntax and probably a bit jarring to those coming from Ruby. Personal opinion is that Python would've been a better direction as it's the least difficult, still widely used and well understood language, highly approachable, and many other external software programs could export assets to Python. 

The resources included have begun to fall behind - they're visually inconsistent between tilesets and themes while also lacking a full set of anything substantive. It's best to look at the included assts as placeholders and if you want to have anything worth making then plan on paying for additional assets in bits or create them entirely yourself. 

$80 isn't much for an ""engine"" and many engines cost more, but unlike other engines RMMV is geared toward a single genre and is severely underpowered compared to several other products on approach. It does it well, but with some of the other bugs and feature cconstraints it can make some customers wonder if the tag is high, all things considered. 

Publishing to mobile platforms uses older methods that aren't very efficient and sometimes ineffective. 

Fewer users have MV and use it than VX/VXA, This makes the available resources and support rather sparse at the moment.

Larger format means assets from previous iterations will have to be converted for use or can't be used at all, and then of course there's certain members of the community are overly protective of the product.... like dealing with Apple fanatics on Facebook."

												Disclaimer: I received a beta key for free from the publisher. However, I swear that this hasn't affected my opinion on the product.  
 
RPG Maker MV is the next program in the long-running RPG Maker series. If you're familiar with the previous versions of the program, you will feel pretty much right at home with MV. On the surface, it functions much like VX Ace, and those who have used it should have no trouble at all getting around the functions of MV. But under the hood, there's a lot more going on, and I think for the most part, it's for the better. 
 
The biggest differences are the program's main selling points - the addition of side-view battles, the ability to export to a number of different platforms, including PC, Mac and phones, as well as the use of Javascript as the primary coding language of the software. This will no doubt make it easier than ever for people to not only make games with RPG Maker, but play them as well. 

There's a handful of other new features as well. Most things are just expansions on what VX Ace already did, like having more Region Tags and more options in the Show Choices Event, but then you have the totally new stuff, like the Event Searcher, the ability to change the amount of equipment slots that your characters have or change default system messages, without the need for additional scripts. 

But at the same time, I think that is one of the program's flaws. It feels too much like VX Ace. It DOES feel like a ""step up"", but it DOESN'T feel like an ""evolution"" of VX Ace, and I think that's what it really needed. You could say that we shouldn't fix what isn't broke, but I think that, despite all the new and exciting features it DOES provide, there are a number of things that I think would have made it all the more exciting and, especially due to the vocal public interest in such features, I'm surprised that they were not included. Sure, you can add a lot of things to the game via Plugins, but you could do the same thing in Ace. It really feels like there's just not enough ""new"" content in MV.
 
One thing I'm definitely happy with are the new default graphical and audio assets. VX Ace had a major problem where just about every project looked the same because the default graphics were so incredibly generic and the character generator was very poor. In some ways, the graphics still are generic, but I think they're much more vibrant looking, and more importantly, there's A LOT more variety, as far as the packed-in assets are concerned. This, I think, will make RPG Maker projects, even those made with only default assets, a lot less monotonous to play. 
 
As far as the character generator is concerned, it's a HUGE improvement. VX Ace's was, quite frankly, terrible, and this one is considerably better. The graphics look exactly like the default pre-generated assets, including the face graphic generator. This allows you to make characters that are consistent with the default assets, and hey, they actually don't look terrible this time. 
 
But there are other problems with MV. The maximum map size has been almost halved. Why? Apparently we can blame phones for that. They've also made it harder and more annoying to add Plugins and new resources to your project. There are no longer buttons in the editor to quickly bring up a resource manager or the page to add in Scripts. Instead, you must navigate to the game's folder on your computer and add everything manually. 

But the absolute biggest problem with MV, in my opinion, is that there is no longer a Run Time Package. The RTP was useful in previous RPG Maker games, because it allowed you to make games with a very small file size by not bundling the RTP with your project, so that other players would need to download the RTP themselves. This made it easy to upload projects to have friends test them, or to seek quick tech support on the forums, with the experts being able to see exactly what you were doing with your project, without them needing to download a large file. 

Well, that's gone. Now, every project you make will be around 400MB. Want to make a quick blank project to test something? That's 400MB more on your hard drive. Want to share your game with someone? You'll have to upload 400MB every time you make a new version of it. Oh sure, you can manually delete all of the assets that you're not using, but this can be a very time consuming process. I can only hope that this problem is addressed in the near future. 

But the big question is... should you buy RPG Maker MV? 
 
Well, I suppose that depends on a few factors. 
 
Do you have the money to burn? If so, definitely get it, because it's the next logical step up above VX Ace. It's an almost all-around improvement and I think that if you can afford it, and you're serious about designing something with the program, then it's definitelty worth your money. 
 
But if you can't really spare the cash, it's probably better to go with VX Ace for now. Ace is much cheaper and has a massive amount of user scripts available. Right now, MV has pretty much none, since it's brand new, but in the coming months, MV will most likely have a number of talented scripters working hard on creating new plugins for the software, and I think with the switch over to Javascript, there will be a lot more interesting and more complex scripts than ever before. This is all just speculation on my part, though. 
 
I think that the next several months will be important for MV, to see what sort of content is created through user scripts and perhaps official DLC. If it can drum up a lot of support, then it will succeed and will be without question the go-to program for making RPGs in an easy-to-use way. But if they can't iron out some of these problems and get more people making Plugins and Resources for the program, I could certainly see it failing. We'll just have to see what happens, won't we?

Overall, I would recommend RPG Maker MV. There's still some issues, but I have faith that they'll iron them out. If you want to wait a while to purchase, I wouldn't blame you, but if they can fix these problems then I will without a doubt recommend this program."

												 Please read my ENTIRE review before setting this review as positive or negative.

This is a very early review considering I haven't fully delved into the application 100%. However, from what I seen of this software and it's capabilities thus far.... Anyone can make a great game from this if they meet a set criteria. But it will take a lot of time and patience. Not just one or two or ten hours. This will take HOUNDREDS of hours. 500+ hours for anything even remotely decent and that still wouldn't even conclude as a finished product.  

The only draw back I have with it, the developers seem to be money grubbers. Too expensive. A lot of DLCs I seen should have came with the base installation of the application or been made free. The application is already very expensive. But that can be overlooked considering what it is capable of. There isn't much content that comes with the application. None the less, you should make your own sprites anyway.  

But.... It would have been a HUGE plus to have more content with the purchase.  However, what it lacks with content it makes up for with a HUGE amount of public/private users that give their creations free to the public as open source. Also, if you DO make a decent game. You could end up making back the money you spent on it originally plus more. There is also a huge amount of support out there among the other users of this product. 

I DO recommend purchasing this application ONLY if you have the time and skills it takes to design a decent game. Since it lacks base content, if you can't actually create your own texture atlases/sprite sheets, your game may well look the same as any other. So, I do NOT recommend it to someone who can't make their own sprites unless you have a friend or team willing to work with you that can make the sprites you need... 

Or, if you think you can use what it comes with and still keep it original. I also recommend this as a learning edge/curve tool for those who would like to learn more about game design and pixel art. If you are an amateur or new to it all together. This tool can be a HUGE incentive to learn.

My review is an opinion. The following are also opinions. I will start with the negatives and then go to the positives.

Negatives :
1. The developers seem to be extremely greedy. Many of the DLCs should have been free to begin with or already come with this application since it already lacks content. I don't agree with the pricing of this application.

2. Lacks basic content. This can be overlooked. You should be making your own content anyway.

3. No start up tutorials. This also can be overlooked since there are many tutorials all over the web.

4. Time consumption. <=== There is no dodging this one. No matter what, it will take time. This application actually cuts the time it would take you to make a game from scratch by 5/25th. Might not seem like a lot, but I made games in the past and it took me a WHOLE YEAR to make one game run on MS-DOS bug free and be available for public purchase..... Trust me, this application DOES cut your time frame greatly. Even though I put this as a negative. It really isn't.

Positives.
1. Starting from scratch vs Using this application. <===== As with the last negative. Using this application will shed much time off of your very very very very time consuming new hobby with making a game. As I stated before, I have made games in the past. From complete scratch to using Unity. This software WILL make EVERYTHING easier for you to make an epic RPG game with.

2. 2.5D <==== Not sure why no one mentioned this. While, RPG MV mainly uses sprites. You CAN actually use your own 3D models now because they allow higher resolution. How? You animate your models in an application like blender, and rip out each frame and turn it into a sprite. That easy. You can optimize all your visuals. I used to do this with Mugen. Just get blender which is free. Design your 3D model, rig it, texture it, etc. And then make the animations you want for use in RPG Maker MV. Now, you will have to resize your sprites. Since RPG Maker MV allows higher resolution, you can keep a great amount of detail in your images. Also, on a side note. Rip only one frame per three frames of your animation unless you need those extra animations. If you have photoshop, there is a free plugin you can use to put all your images into a texture atlas-sprite sheet and that plug in is free. You can do the same with Gimp and that also, is free.

3. Higher resolution. <=== Of all the previous RPG Makers I used, this one is technically worth that huge junk of change. I think 80 USD is a bit nuts. 50 USD I believe is an accurate price range. But I digress. Since now, you can use higher resolution sprites, you can make your games be able to compete with current gen of mobile app games and the like.

4. Cross Platform. <==== Do I really need to say more?!?!?! You can create your game for MANY different platforms now! INCLUDING MAC! For the longest time, RPG Maker was not compatible with mac. NOW IT IS! :)  This, in my opinion. Is a HUGE HUGE HUGE bonus.

5. User Base. <==== This is another huge bonus. Never have I seen a more open and kind user base for any application in my life. If you don't believe me, google Yanfly. That guy has been CONSTANTLY making more and more plugins FREE for all to use! Seriously! His site has MANY MANY videos including his youtube account. Tutorials and more. And he is just one individual. I spent a WHOLE DAY just going through his site. The vast amount of plugins he made for RPG Maker MV alone, turns it into a super super RPG Maker. There are MANY MANY other content creators for RPG Maker MV that give their work out as open source. Just look around.  =)

6. Teaching tool. <===== This application will help teach you java script and much more without directly doing so. Only because, they are need to know assets for this application. You can be completely new/ignorant to Java script. But by using this application and obtaining new assets for it from other RPG Maker MV users and going through the many tutorials. In no time you will begin to learn Java script. (""Java script is not java""). But that is just one example. There are many pixel artists out there as well who have tutorials. When reading their tutorials and then trying the same for yourself, you will notice over time you will gain more and more knowledge. And before you know it, you will be a pro.

7. More freedom. <=== previous RPG makers had their many many limits. But thanks to individuals like yanfly and the rest of the RPG Maker MV community, this application now is almost limitless in what you can accomplish for your game. Main limits will be (""Size"") of the sprites. Other than that though, very few limits. The community is constantly making new plug-ins to remove what previous limits it had.

8. The love. <==== For some reason, this application makes some people very kind and lovey dubby. (""Possible side affect/effect"") Just watch the youtube tutorial videos and you will see. Why did I mark this as a positive? Well, the nicer the people, the more willing they are to help you when you have a question or an issue.

And with that, ending my review. If you took your time to read this entire review, I thank you. ^^"

												I have been playing with this program for a bit now. I have fun just creating areas in it. Scripting is fun in it as well. Its a lot more fun to work with than I had originally thought. I might even finish this project and put it on steam. I am no expert at it but I am having a blast playing around with it. This is the perfect software for people who like to write stories. It gives the reader the chance to act the story out and watch it come to life. Compared to the other game making programs I use, this one is probably the easiest to make an actual game with. There are a great many 3rd party plug ins for this software but remember, every time you add one it makes your creation a bit more laggy, even on a high end system. This software is not about making the best looking game, graphics wise, but it is very good at making a highly interactive game that is heavily story based. There are many ways to add your own custom content into your creations but as usual it requires effort and time. Over all, I give it a thumbs up."

												Things I liked:

Character Generator, along with a Side-View Generator
Music is decent
Scripting Galore
Plenty of Tutorials
Liked the addition of a dark/gray HUD
Basically everything is upgraded from previous RPG Makers

Things I didn't like:
There isn't a side-view battler for every character they give. So no Fairy party members (if side-view battling).
The DLC leaves a LOT to be desired. As in, you can totally just buy the software and not lose much, if anything.


Don't take TOO much stock in my review, since all I did so far was make a Prologue to my game. Which still isn't finished. Should I find anything else interesting, I might just change my review. However, chances are pretty high that I'll forget I made a review in the first place.

Overall: If you have the money, and like making games, I definitely recommend this software."

												Ok, looking my hours on this...

I think I've been a little bit crazy without finishing a single game.


Is this good.

YES.

RPGMaker always has some good resources.

Tileset? Checked.

Overwold characters? Checked.

Music? Sound effect? Commonly used assets?

All checked.

Besides those good things above, MV massivly improved its script system

And OH MY GOD it's cross platform.

The problem for me is the image assets feel too ""blocky.""

2000 and 2003 don't have this problem. They're like wine - old and neat.

But this is just a minor complain.


If you're concern about its price, you could try some free game engine.

Or maybe play some games made by this.

Don't like it, don't buy it.

If you like it, put some time into it.

I believe you would love it."

												I do recommend that you purchase this rpg maker over the last one RPG Maker Ace due to the updated graphics and there appears to be andriod and ios exports. The main reason I recommend this one is the resolution having the larger resolution makes the game look better.

Pros
Larger resolution
Icons for weapons
Icons for skills
Side view battles
Better Character Generator
Effects look better


Cons
More Expensive 
Less prebuilt Monsters (I believe RPG Maker Ace had alot more but I haven't confirmed)

*there are probably more but I can't think of any at this time.

Honestly if your looking to make an rpg of this style I would get this version over Ace just becuase it looks better and has the extra exports. If your looking to create a game for your phone or for steam, this is a good way to start. (Granted it may take awhile before you finish a game)"

												If you've used RPG Maker in the past, this will be very straightforward for you. I'm sure there is a learning curve, but I've been using the RM series since RM95 so I'm probably not someone who can comment on the newbie aspect.

This is pretty much the step forward I have been waiting for. The Javascript is far more functional than ruby ever was. The game now supports just about any resolution you want, wide screen, mobile/html5 porting, mouse/keyboard/gamepad custom controls; functionality wise there isn't much more that I could want.

The asset pack leaves room to be desired, but it is what it is. If you're a serious designer, you likely won't be using those assets anyhow. You can definitely make a game without needing more stuff, I'd just prefer a larger variety of character maker customizations. 

I'm going to keep chipping away at my game; if I run into any strange problems I'll be sure to update this review."

												I find it way better then Rpg maker VX Ace. It got better system on how things work, yet it s very similar to rpgmaker vx ace, I really like the feature of a full making character, it is so great! 

It would have been nice if they already had made a plugin for Questing, since that is the only thing it need. In my opinion.
If you have played around with Rpgmaker vx ace i recommand this to you.

But be aware there are bugs! Or there is for me, when i try change some ex-parameters the software freezes, or just dont awnser."

												I own all the rpgmakers and was excited for MV. I am so disappointed.

1) The biggest issue is the random crashes when working in the editor. In the middle of clicking through menus, editing events? "".exe has stopped working.""

2) The editor lags when bringing up menus. Instead of cycling through events and tabs like normal, there is a 3-5 second delay each time. It gets old fast and woe unto you if it decides to crash without saving.

3) My biggest issue is MV was advertised as easy ios export and put your game on tablets,etc. It is a lie, after you export you need to go through their (47 page or so) help file and get all these 3rd party programs to wrap it. It is not only lengthy, but difficult for someone unfamiliar with it. 

4) The dlc was nothing special, nor what I expected. 

TL:DR: I am a rpgmaker fan, MV is terrible. Not worth the price."

												This is the most powerful RPG Maker yet and it is filled to the bring with options for customizing everything and creating your game exactly how you want it. Contrary to the title, you definitely don't have to make RPG games with this, you can make basically anything you can dream of (provided it's 2D). Now with the simple encryption methods like the previous makers had and the resource manager, I would recommend this to EVERYONE looking to create their very first game and any amount of games after that. I will always stick by the RPG Maker name as long as they keep putting out amazing products such as this one. Top notch!"

												The HTML5/web export opens up amazing possibilities. The game is basically playable on everything that runs a sufficiently modern web browser, including Linux. If you liked the previous RPG Maker installments, this one is definitely worth getting for that alone. (This also allows playing the game streamed in the web browser as part of some web page without being required to bother with a full download)

Please beware though that the program is a bit on the expensive side: RPG Maker is best for making a specific type of RPG, and if you don't make sure this matches your expectations you're probably gonna be disappointed that you have put all the money into it, so make sure to try the trial first before you buy!

												RPG Maker MV is definitely the best title in the series yet. With more options than ever before, more intuitive interface, better character generator, and new and returning features such as the side-view battle mode, Plugin Manager (replacing Script Editor from VX Ace), and exporting to mobile devices, RPG Maker MV is the most robust out of the pack. 

It has a few faults, namely a steeper learning curve than the advertisements tell you (circumvented easily just by testing things out and using tutorials) and that the exporting function is not built-in on the program itself and necessitates outside software to do so, as well as the Plugin Manager no longer allowing manual editting of the default code like the Script Editor did. For newbies this won't be a problem, but for people with a basic knowledge of code but not enough to make their own plugins/scripts, this can be a bit of a turnoff. Thankfully plugins can easily get around any of these things like scripts could in the past. Also, make sure to look through your folders when you download the software: for ease of mobile exporting, not all the resources are immediately added to the default project loading, though they are included in separate folders.

Thankfully these faults are few and the pros are many. More great resources, an easy-to-use database, and a much better character generator make for an inviting software. All of the functions of event scripting and database tinkering for the most part copy off of VX Ace as well with some changes so for veterans returning from the last installment, you'll adapt quickly and easily. Being able to have HD resolution and mobile export is also obviously a plus.

Overall verdict: if you love old-school RPGs and always wanted to make your own, look into this software. It's intuitive, robust, and surprisingly easy to use once you get down the basics. $80 might be a steep price tag, and so if that turns you away, wait for a sale or try out RPG Maker 2003 or XP, more invitingly priced at $20-25, but don't forget to come back here to MV to make a real powerhouse of a retro RPG. This software gives you all the tools to make it happen."

												RPG Maker MV Reviewby KTMboyz

""Simple enough for a child, powerful enough for a developper""

I dumped a good couple hundred hours into RPGMaker VX Ace and don't regret it all!  I showed myself how it worked, made tons of mistakes and learned from each and every one.  When I heard the next one was coming out; I preordered it right away!  When I finally got my hands on it, I wasn't dispointed.  RPG Maker MV really does make it easier to create an RPG without programming. The biggest thing that I enjoyed was the side-view battle screens, in VX Ace, you would have to script that...  MV does alot more that couldn't do in previous installments (or would have to script).  The Plugin system is cool, the new screen resolution is great and being able to script with Java are all great examples of how MV has evolved over VX Ace.  People are complaining about the crappy default graphics, but I make my own so I don't care :)  I do think it is a bit overpriced but try it out, it's a lot of fun!"

												I want to write an actual constructive review , but some people have already exposed the good and bad points in the review section . So , to make short :

Cons : 
_No RTP anymore , every new project will take the whole 400Mb to make , even for a little test thing
_Including outside content now requires to be done manually , while it could be done with a simple button inside the program in previous versions
_Same goes for script editing , the tool isn't here and you have to includes external scripts
_[NOTICED AND BEING FIXED BY DEVS] Changing the variable of status alterations makes the program crash . Devs are aware and fixing it .
(_I've also heard that converting games for android and all wasn't as easy as it was sadi

Now for the pros :
_Graphically fine , new Science-Fiction tilesets , graph and all are also a nice new elements , allowing to make decent utopian worlds 
_a GOOD character/face editor , with decent features unlike the horrible things that were predominant in VX Ace's one , also allowing you to put several characters in a simple sheet and to save samples
_Included 2d combat system (you could do that with scripts in VX for exemple , but I remember it used to crash sometimes , in here it's stable)
_Keeps all the usual features from other RPG makers , minus the ones described in the cons .
_Bigger default resolution for games , more detailed default sprites !
_That's a personal thinking , but the default musics included are better than before . (VX ones were good but VX Ace's were honestly ... idk , not as good ?)



It all depends what you're looking for . Saying it is easier than ever to make games sounds a bit like a lie considering how some of the options were removed , but all in all you still can do them by yourself , the base ressources are good , the char generator is very good and the side battle brings a refreshing change . Personally , I'm satisfied with my order !"

												1. Get this.
2. Start a project.
3. Make half your database.
4. Decide it's too hard, and give up.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 an indefinite number of times.
6. Decide to actually finish a game.
7. Spend a year making it.
8. Try to play it.
9. Bang your head in frustration when it doesn't work.
10. After three months and an extensive amount of JS knowledge, fix it.
11. Feel satisfied.
12. Repeat steps 8-11 until you're sick of fixing bugs.
13. Release your game.
14. Repeat steps 2-13 for all of eternity, because making games is so fun.

												Stick with VXAce.Trust me. It's really not worth it. Sure, the face generator, side-view system, and resolution are better, but it doesn't make up for the fact that it doesn't do as advertised. There is no easy way of porting to Android/iOS. The HTML5 didn't work for me. And honestly, I think that VXAce looks better than MV. If they fix these problems in the future, I'll buy it again. But for now, I think it's time to try out Steam's refund service"

												I'm still very new to this and I didn't use VX Ace much. But, I think this is a pretty awesome tool. The character editor is much improved from VX Ace, and you can draw regions using rectangular tools which saves a lot of time. The scripting is now in Javascript, which I am accustomed to. You can press F8 during a playtest to open a full featured Chrome debugger and dig into variables and code with ease.

So far, I'm having a lot of fun with this!"

Análisis en ingles y español.

Review in english and spanish.

English.

So far, not work the money. I mean, its almost the same as VX ACE, with a little change in image and adding some things here and there. Worst is that it feels more slow than VX.

Pros so far:
- The character editor has more variety and more easy to use.
- Tileset that let you do more modern maps (barely).
- New artworks like new charas, monsters and stuff.
- Preinstalled scripts for a variety of well know people.
- You can make games for moviles devices and seems like you can do a local semi multiplayer if I understand right the guide page.
- It seems that you can copy-paste resources to the game files, without problems like transparency in images.

Cons:
- Slow interfaz
- Is the same as VX but more fancy. Feels more like a 'update' than a new system.
- Dont know in english, I speak spanish, but the translation feels like was did with google translate or something.
- Has less sounds than ACE.
- Iconset is just a bunch or mini signs instead of images of the items. I feel like they just got lazy.

So far this software make me disappointed, I was expecting something with more new stuff but intead got the same thing that before but with a little more things here and a little less there.

Recommended only if is your first time purcahrsing and RPG Maker Software and only in discount.

6/10 still too little ""New"".

Español.

Hasta el momento, no vale la pena el gasto. Es decir, es casi lo mismo que VX ACE, con un pequeño cambio de imagen ademas de agregar algunas cosas aqui y allá. Peor, se siente mas lento que VX.

Cosas a favor hasta el momento:

- El editor de personajes tiene mas variedad y es mas facil de utilizar.
- Los Tileset ahora te permiten crear (vagamente) mapas mas actuales.
- Nuevo arte para los personajes, monstruos y otras cosas.
- Scripts pre instalados de varias personas conocidas en el medio.
- Puedes crear juegos para dispositivos moviles y, sin entiendo correctamente, una especie de multijugador local segun la guia de la paguina.
- Al parecer puedes copiar-pegar archivos a las carpetas de datos del juego, sin resultar en problemas como la transparencia de imagenes.

Contras:

- La interfaz es lenta.
- Es el mismo VX Ace pero mas refinado. Se siente como una actualización más que un sistema nuevo.
- No se como sea en ingles, pero la traducción al español es bastante mala. Se siente hecha con el traductor de google.
- Tiene menos sonidos que VX Ace.
- El iconset no es mas que un monton de pequeños carteles en lugar de imagenes en miniatura de los objetos. Da la impreción de que les entro flojera en ese aspecto.

Hasta ahora, este programa me tiene decepcionado. Estaba esperando algo con mas novedades pero en su lugar me dieron lo que ya tenia a la par que le agregaban pequeñas cosas y le quitaban otras.

Recomendado solamente si es tu primera vez comprando un RPG Maker, y en oferta unicamente.

6/10 Todavia muy pocas novedades."

												It's a great engine, and also very user-friendly! I didn't ever use any other RPG Maker engines(Yeah, that's my first one), so i couldn't really tell if this engine is better, but i do like it. The generator is also pretty good, and parts can be easily added."

												I don't understand why people don't like this rpg maker and compare it to VX Ace.
I know there is more on VX Ace but in this you can make it for IOS/ANDROID and it is a very good thing.
I don't like the new sprites but I am using custom sprites so it is not a problem.
The language is now javascript and with this everything is so easy.
Some people say that it is don't convert to real APK when you make it for ANDROID or IOS(.ipa),
If you know how to do mobile games then you know program wouldn't just 1.2GB if you could make real APK or IPA files.
But it is a very good and different from others."

												 Is not my favorite, actually is just superior to the XP in my opinion (The XP is pretty bad in some aspects) I got it in a free trial mode when it appeared, and even being free, didn't spend much time on it because... is just the XP with a few things new

 Pros:
 - Improved character making
 - New commands in the ""Command window""
 - Can make games for mobile
 - Tileset overlay save a lot of time, instead of make a event with a tilest piece
 
 Cons:
 - The new commands already existed as scripts for VX ace
 - The tilesets are pretty bad, following the type of XP
 - There is not many things there to do different of VX ace
 - The focus on mobile take all the flexibility of the tool

 ---===@@@@@@===---
 I tried reverse engineering in all this programs 2000, 2003, VX, VX ace, XP and now I'll try MV and so far, I stick with the VX ace, yet, is only my opinion, if you have the patience and the skils to make it work, go ahead, try for yourself, I honestly will not spend my money on this one... 
 But I'm not going to negativate this one, after all, I never know what it can do in the future, I hope I can see awesome games made in this tool"

												Still early, lots of new plug-ins etc will be on the way. Those that have placed bad reviews are probably too impatient to create a game. This sucks away your soul in a pretty good way. Looking forward to good stuff with this version. Yes, there are issues, but the good outweighs the bad. If you decide to hold off, that's fine. It's only going to get better from here. Please try not to pay too much attention to bad reviews. Once you get a grasp on the software, it's tons of fun. I caught on quick and haven't designed a game since RPG Maker 2003, so don't get too worried if you haven't played previous installments. Most of the engine has stayed true to its older versions with the layout and event setups. Best of luck on your projects!"

												Love, love, LOVE it.

RPG Maker has always been the go-to game maker for those who want to get started in expressing their creativity without learning complex programming languages, and over the course of the last few installments it's grown considerably in flexibility thanks to the introduction of scripting and plugins.

RPG Maker MV's use of JavaScript-based plugins is by far the most elegant solution the developer has come up with to extending the engine's functionality yet. No more accidentally putting scripts in the wrong place -- though in some cases, the order in which you load the plugins matters -- and no more configuration by delving into scary-looking script, thanks to dedicated plugin parameter windows.

Even if you don't want to delve into the more complex aspects of customisation with plugins, RPG Maker MV remains the same easy to use package that it's always been. The mapping and eventing systems will be immediately familiar to series veterans -- though some will miss the ""layers"" approach to mapping -- and the included resources are of high quality. A particular shout out to the included music, which is particularly good; Shoji Meguro would be proud of the wailing electric guitars on display in some of the battle themes.

Combine all that with the fact that you can now export your games to Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and HTML5 and you have a formidable package for getting started in game development. Even if you never bring your grand designs to the commercial market, if nothing else RPG Maker is a great means of learning the basic logic of programming and how to tell your computer to do things. For some, it will be enough to realise their dreams; for others, it will be a stepping stone to more complex tools and techniques.

Either way, if you have the slightest interest in making games, pick this up. And be sure to check out the community content, too; there's already a ton of great resources and plugins available, many of which are completely free to use in both commercial and non-commercial products."

												I am so disappointed in this. A little backstory; I love RPG Maker VX Ace, and when I saw MV was on sale for $40 I simply couldn't pass it up. I purchased it aswell as a few DLC's becuase of how cheap they were, and I was so utterly depressed with what I got. So like normal, the DLC's were very confusing to even try to integrate into a project. That's expected and not why I wouldn't recommend this. The reason is from, I suppose the easiest way to say it, the interface and database shallowness. It seems with the default screen where you see all of the various buttons and such, that it feels so cartoony and not as serious as VX Ace. VX Ace seemed confusing but you realize you don't use half of the buttons anyways, but the interface itself seemed way too simplified and didn't feel like I was using an actual piece of software. At the same time, the database, now I'm not sure if this is a single issue for just me and if it is I apoligize, was the nail in the coffin. In every various tab it had maybe at max 5 items/characters/etc. each. That was it. VX Ace had so many things to offer from the beginning that most of the time you don't have to create your own stuff. 


Overall, I can see how this may appear to be bias so go ahead and click that unhelpful button. The software's artstyle for faces got me excited but left me a bit uninterested afterwards, and the interface feels like you're using KidPix (look it up). I know I'm complaining about how it isn't RPG Maker VX Ace, but it's the internet. What are you gonna do."

												I own all the rpgmakers and was excited for MV. I am so disappointed.

1) The biggest issue is the random crashes when working in the editor. In the middle of clicking through menus, editing events? "".exe has stopped working.""

2) The editor lags when bringing up menus. Instead of cycling through events and tabs like normal, there is a 3-5 second delay each time. It gets old fast and woe unto you if it decides to crash without saving.

3) My biggest issue is MV was advertised as easy ios export and put your game on tablets,etc. It is a lie, after you export you need to go through their (47 page or so) help file and get all these 3rd party programs to wrap it. It is not only lengthy, but difficult for someone unfamiliar with it. 

4) The dlc was nothing special, nor what I expected. 

TL:DR: I am a rpgmaker fan, MV is terrible. Not worth the price."

												So far I've only done the basics.
Created about 50+ characters with the character maker, created a few maps (inside and outside) with many events.
Have not tried the battle system, items, enemy creation, party formations, skills, weapons...
still so much to do but it's fun and a great way to spend your time making little games with inside jokes for your friends and family. I don't think I'll ever be able to make a game that will go to market but that wasnt my intention when buying the game.
well worth the money for me thus far."

												Once again, the folks behind the RPG Makers have gone above and beyond with their work. I absolutely adored this as soon as I started it up! But I have a few minor complaints:
1: Not as much content as VX Ace. This might not be as big of a problem for you guys as it is for me, but it kinda bugged me that I had less to work with while I build my game. Which kind of means I had to turn to the Workshop for a bit of remidiation. And that brings us to...
2: Not much Workshop content to work with(This essentially means I have to ""borrow"" some stuff from the VX Ace Workshop.  *insert nervous sweat drop here*). Well, I imagine most of the best at RPG Maker are still transitioning over from VX Ace, so I can't really complain too much about this.

All in all, MV is still fantastic! And even though there's not as much content, what's there is new and just plain cool! Getting to use the side view Battler is something I've never been able to do before(well, embarrassingly because the only other RPG Maker that I have is VX Ace. *sweat drop*)! And just building up the game itself is an adventure in and of itself because unlike other RPG Makers, this is a game you're building from the ground up; a very simple set of weapons, a very simple set of classes, armor, cast members, about everything is simplified in MV.

Well, except for the maps...

Would I recommend this? YES! Primarily because a friend of mine already had(hence the reason I recieved this product for free). And even with these downs, there are always more ups to counter and trump them. 

Have fun, and see you on the Workshop!

(I hope! *last sweat drop*)"

												This is the first Rpg maker software I've gotten. I went into this blind and spent the first hour or so not knowing what the hell I was doing. So I went to youtube and watched some videos on how everything worked. Once you understand how everything works its a nice piece of software. So If you are new to this like I was i recomend heading to youtube to learn all the intricies. I watched SumRndmDde's videos he has, at this point, 30 videos running through everything from map making to animations and switchs/varibles. I'd recomend him as a starting off point. For plugins, which are extensions that you can add to manipulate the base software in different ways,  I reccomend looking up YanFly, tons of free plugins to make your game different from a base rpg maker mv game.  If It's on sale I'd say go for it, full price may be a bit much however, I'd say wait until it's on sale"

												I've just started playing with this engine and so far I'm pretty happy with it.

Some major pros:
-The graphic style looks to be designed for mobile platforms
-The engine is easy to navigate and use
-Multi platform export options (obviously)

Major cons:
-The anime style and chibi characters might turn some people away
-Default resources are kinda scarce

Overall:
With a bit of creativity you can make tons of games unique using the default graphics,I have been a fan of the Rpg maker series for years and I own several. Mv is definitely my new favourite since VxAce, I like the few changes in art style and resolution.
This engine has a lot of potential, it's up to the users to discover it and use it.
That said the engine does lag a little and takes a bit of time to load things properly, I believe this is due to a tiny memory leak because it uses Javascript as Javascript is known to cause such issues.
I don't mind that because I like the engine and I will use it until the next engine in the series comes out even if it takes 100 years!"

												I'm still very new to this and I didn't use VX Ace much. But, I think this is a pretty awesome tool. The character editor is much improved from VX Ace, and you can draw regions using rectangular tools which saves a lot of time. The scripting is now in Javascript, which I am accustomed to. You can press F8 during a playtest to open a full featured Chrome debugger and dig into variables and code with ease.

So far, I'm having a lot of fun with this!"

												I do like this new version although it does have it's pitfalls. I'll just list some pros and cons and my opinion on changes and also why it is still worth buying.

Pros:
-Very nice interface, cleaner than VXA, more default customizability
-The plugin manager is awesome! (see cons too!)
-Uses javascript!
-The character generator is awesome! generates side battlers and just feels more customizable than VXA.
-Export to mobiles, HTML5, and PC/Mac
-Higher resolution!
-Side battle view is awesome!

Cons:
-I'm not a fan of the chibi like characters
-The plugin manager sometimes doesnt show all the changable variables
(ex: Yanfly Battle engine core forces stars above attacked things, uneditable in the manager)
-Very few Assets unlike in VXA, Item icons wise you get practically nothing
-Some of the enemy pics are rediculously HUGE and very cartoony
-I HATE the plus minus zoom buttons, SLIDER (with mouse scroll controls) PLEASE!!!

To summerize it is still an amazing piece of software and the cons can be worked around just by creating your own assets.

What I want to see:
-official templates for an item sheet/other assets. This would make it easier for everyone to make thier own assets especially since making your own items is a near necessity.
-A Slider for the zoom
-A dark theme! I hate brightness in my software :)"

												I wholeheartedly recommend RPG Maker MV as a starter software for anyone who is interested in making a game.
I see a lot of people who recommend Unity, or Unreal Engine as ""easy"" tools for beginners, but both of those require a decent coding knowledge of some description (well, Unreal Engine 4 not so much) and on top of that you will need to make your own assets for the game to be high-quality, unless you want to purchase an asset pack off someone else.

RPG Maker requires zero coding experience, just patience and understanding. The eventing system, while it takes a bit of time to fully figure out (Self switches and ""delete event"" commands reset after you change map - I learned that the hard way and had to change a large amount of my story triggers), is very simple to use, but allows for (functionally) limitless possibilities. 

Improvements over VX Ace, the previous iteration of the software, include (for those interested):
- Changing the nightmare-inducing front portrait character generator to a side portrait one, allowing you to create much                                more aesthetically pleasing character portraits. 
- Native Sideview Battle mode, no longer requiring custom scripting.
-Significantly improved OST, with much improved themes for everything.
-Javascript instead of Ruby (kind of a big deal, plugins are now able to do a lot more)
-Export to pretty much anything (Browser, Android, IOS, Windows etc.) whereas VX Ace only supported Windows (I think)
-Modern Tilesets/assets provided with the base game - no more reliance on custom content for a modern-themed RPG.
-Various QoL improvements (showing you where the dialog window cuts off when editing, so you don't accidentally have your text not showing properly ingame because you forgot to hit enter)
-Native Touch/Mouse control support.

If you can't afford it at base price (it is pretty expensive, to be fair) you can wait for a sale, and I'm told that key reseller websites sell it for a much lower price (about 50% cheaper), but use those at your own risk.

Either way, this is a brilliant tool for anyone interested in game design, beginner or otherwise. (I might go as far as to say it is the tool to start with for those who are interested in game development but have little/no coding knowledge.

Definitely Recommend."

												RPG Maker MV is an a great addition to the RPG Maker Series. I first started using RPG Maker VX Ace approximately two years ago and it was then that I fell in love with the software.

As with RPG Maker VX Ace, MV offers the tools to make an old JRPG styled game with ease. Unlike Ace however, MV is built on JavaScript whilst Ace used Ruby. JavaScript is much more powerful and enables more flexibility in my opinion when it comes to creating/applying plugins. <--- Keep in mind that the scripting part is optional, you do not need any coding to be create an amazing RPG Game. Granted it does help add features to make your games unique.

Pros:
- Great Community: I absolutely love the RM Community, you can find tons of resources, tutorials and scripts to use in your projects. The community is quite active, so if you have any questions feel free to ask them.
- High Res - (48x48): Compared to VXAce, MV now has a resolution scale allowing for a higher level of quality for sprites and mapping. Always a nice addition.
- Tons of customisation options: The character generator has taken a big jump in flexibility since VXAce, allowing for more customisation of faces and sprites. Oh and you can import your own generator parts! The sprite sheets produced also contain more sprites for various situations, side battlers, damage etc.
- Easy to learn: As with all RMs, it's pretty easy to get around once you learn the basic functions.
- New Prebuilt Side Battler Mode: You can now take the side battler approach for your games as opposed to front facing approach (for battle sequences). This could only be achieved by using a custom script before.
- Export to Mac/Android/iOS/PC : A nice feature that enables you to export your commercial/non-commercial projects.

Cons:
I'm slightly biased as I absolutely love this software, but I have come across some minor issues that do create additional work when I'm creating my game.
- Bugs and Glitches: The software is still relatively new (relative to the original date of this review), so there are some minor bugs still present. In my case, I found some issues with the shadow tool. Certain shaded areas would render when the games were executed. These were usually fixed though by erasing and re-tiling the affected areas.

So do I recommend this software? Absolutely!!! Although, if you're new to the series, I suggest you start of with an older varient such as VX Ace which can usually be found for cheap during sales and on bundle sites such as Humble Bundle and Bundle Stars.

I give this software, 10/10."

												Once again, the folks behind the RPG Makers have gone above and beyond with their work. I absolutely adored this as soon as I started it up! But I have a few minor complaints:
1: Not as much content as VX Ace. This might not be as big of a problem for you guys as it is for me, but it kinda bugged me that I had less to work with while I build my game. Which kind of means I had to turn to the Workshop for a bit of remidiation. And that brings us to...
2: Not much Workshop content to work with(This essentially means I have to ""borrow"" some stuff from the VX Ace Workshop.  *insert nervous sweat drop here*). Well, I imagine most of the best at RPG Maker are still transitioning over from VX Ace, so I can't really complain too much about this.

All in all, MV is still fantastic! And even though there's not as much content, what's there is new and just plain cool! Getting to use the side view Battler is something I've never been able to do before(well, embarrassingly because the only other RPG Maker that I have is VX Ace. *sweat drop*)! And just building up the game itself is an adventure in and of itself because unlike other RPG Makers, this is a game you're building from the ground up; a very simple set of weapons, a very simple set of classes, armor, cast members, about everything is simplified in MV.

Well, except for the maps...

Would I recommend this? YES! Primarily because a friend of mine already had(hence the reason I recieved this product for free). And even with these downs, there are always more ups to counter and trump them. 

Have fun, and see you on the Workshop!

(I hope! *last sweat drop*)"

												RPG Maker advertizes itself as being simple enough for a child, but powerful enough for a professional. As someone who has herself programmed games the hard way, I can assure you that this statement is true. For the new game developer, RPG Maker provides a nice framework to understand how mechanics and gameplay can mesh with story and helps learn the basics of game design - how to telegraph things to your players, how to make enemies an appropriate strength, etc.
For those who know how to do that, RPG Maker trims the fat, saving you the time of having to program different elemental types while still giving you the option to modify it if you want.
And that, I think, is the power of this tool. It presents you with so many options to get you started, but can do so much more if you know how to code."

												I think... If you're a beginning artist or programmer, or you are a one man team who is going to attend a video game jam, this is an amazing engine to work with. Think about it this way... If you are just starting out, it is easy to make a game that is ""too big."" It becomes easy for your game's design to become abstracted and for you to lose focus, particularly if you are not experienced. A lot of people just hit a wall with this kind of stuff, become overwhelmed and give up. And that's even without the whole rule of the last 10% of a project always being the hardest part to complete...

RPG Maker gets a bad rep in the professional games community but it's because people keep trying to sell games that are substandard, with a lot of the default assets, and beginner game design mistakes... 

 The fact is, this is a fairly robust system should you desire to make a turn-based, old school JRPG. I would totally recommend it to the right person.

 Basically, I have used this engine at game jams, and to make a gift for my fiance, and it gave me the focus I needed to pump funny JRPGs out very quickly. I could have used Unity or Unreal but then we are talking months of work instead of days.

 If you're really experienced and not interested in JRPGs there are tons of great free engines out there for you. But if you DO like JRPGs and want to  make them, you should check this out."

												For someone who has been experimenting with just about every RPG Maker from 2003~VX Ace.
I have to say this is one of THE best RM's to this date.

I really love the simple built in Side View battle system which is easy to use and no
complicated scripting is needed.


This will be the FIRST RPG Maker that I will actually use for a commercial project.
It's that good.

I knew when seeing the trailer before the release was announced that I was going to
enjoy this, and I Pre-Ordered this as soon as I could without second thoughts.

I recommand this to anyone who loves making RPGs.
It's litterally the BEST that has been released so far.


However, I'd suggest you listen to the System Specs.
I had to get a new PC to use the program at ease compared to the previous makers.
(I was getting a gaming PC anyways, so it wasn't a big deal.)"

												There is a lot of good things I could say and this has lots of potential, but the reason I wouldn't recommend this is because from what I've seen and been able to do so far with it, it's not a huge improvement over their vx ace version which is cheaper so for now that's what I'd recommend, ""RPG Maker"" is a fairly good system and from what I see vx ace still has a lot of the same stuff mx does and the improvements mx has aren't all that useable without information that I can't seem to get my hands on. One of the things they advertise in mx, and was the thing that made me want to upgrade, is how you can make scripts in JavaScript, but while the support is there as you can see that there are some included examples that are in JavaScript, there is basically no information on the api between the two. so you either have to completely reverse engineer all the scripts you have access in order to figure out how to make your Javascript work in the game, or stuck using just the basic script editor which while it is easy to use it's not very versatile.  As without knowing the api there's no way for your advanced scripts to access any of the game data, or cause anything meaningful to happen in the game.  There is a help file that at the end does list some things you can use in the JavaScript code but it's really poorly organized and difficult to find stuff in and I think either it's missing some rather important bits or it's to poorly organized for me to find them. I even went looking for tutorials on their scripting system.  I found stuff on how to do it on vx ace, and plenty of material on how to program in JavaScript, but nothing on how the scripts tie into mx games which makes simply knowing how to program in JavaScript useless to making games.

So while RPG MAKER an awesome system that is a great starting point for anyone who wants to get into game development.  The MX version is not versatile enough to really go much beyond just starting out. So You'd be better off getting the VX Ace version at least until people have had a chance to get the how to use it better put together. 

I think if your good enough to reverse engineer their scripts and figure out how to use the JS scripts on your own, you'd probably also be able to figure out how to use a more advanced systems like unity or unreal. So while I'd recomend  the VX Ace to some one just getting started I'm not so sure if any of them are flexable enough for more advanced style games."

												Great game engine. I don't say that this engine is the best among the other, but this engine comes with packed J-RPG-style drag and drop GUI. It's true that it's easy and simple enough for kids, but powerful enough for developer. Moreover since this engine comes with Javascript based plugins and can be exported into static HTML site which means we can deploy it almost everywhere, from PC, Mac, Android, iOS, even on the black and white Linux server :D 

I recommend this for everyone who want to learn creating game especially RPG and have lack of programming experience. BUT if you are a developer or programmer who looking after casual JS game engine or not focused on J-RPG games, I think the other engine is much better and easier to use."

												I probably followed the same path as most people. I didn't know how to make a video game and one day I thought ""Hell, why not?"". Enter the RPG Maker franchise. Its main attraction is that it can let you make a video game even though you don't know how to use codes and all. This software is a real game-making noob magnet. As you're reading this, I bet you're feeling exactly like I did.

When I first opened the program, I guess I felt like most RPG Maker neophytes. I thought ""What in the world am I going to do now?"". The software will barely guide you. You'll feel helpless for a few minutes, to say the least. There are no tutorials, just limited information here and there. There's an underwhelming amount of tools and icons which will make you wonder whether or not you have to unlock a ""pro"" mode somewhere that'll hopefully uncover additional stuff. Well, that's ""pro mode"" for you. What you see is what you get. The sprites, scenery ""tiles"" and other assets are also extremely limited. 21st century instinct will kick in and you'll eventually do like everyone else: you rely on your good ol' internet and search for the missing knowledge. ""How do I make RPG Maker work?""

After a couple of hours or so, you'll figure out that the RPG Maker franchise is somehow continuously lacking in content and that it heavily relies on its online community to actually make things happen. And thank God this community exists. There are countless plugins, animations, tilesets, etc. at your disposal. And, so far, although I haven't interacted with a lot of people, I have to say that this community is highly positive, always interested in improving all the RPG Maker softwares and their games, whether it be their game or someone else's. They are always willing to help the newcomers - which is something I truly admire in today's world where most people will frown upon those who always ask the same questions and come up with the same issues as they learn and progress.

With a bunch of plugins in hand, you will eventually discover that RPG Maker MV has tons of additional potential. It's still limited, of course. Obviously, you can't make a 3D FPS, for example, but there are possibilities of making something else which might not be a RPG in the true nature of the genre. There are good examples out there on the net.

Now here's the hard part. Think of RPG Maker as a car. Now imagine everyone has the exact same car. You'll need to make your own parts in order to make your car unique. It's the same with RPG Maker. If your desire is to make a game to remember, you need to make your own sprites, your own backgrounds, your own music, etc. There's no way to make a good game only with what RPG Maker offers.

This leads me to believe that the people involved with this program are somewhat lazy and greedy. Lazy because they could make an editor which would allow you to create stuff within RPG Maker. Greedy because the price is quite high for what the program delivers and also because they appear to have stopped updating the software, instead delivering pricey DLCs so they can milk the cow a little more, using - or abusing - those who don't have the skills to make their own sprites, backgrounds, etc... Considering that they've made a good amount of money with this popular software, you'd think that they would offer more free content and that they wouldn't just let other folks do the hard, dirty work by creating useful plugins.

But, yeah, the software neverthelessly delivers. Thanks to the community. Will you make a game? Can't say for sure. I believe many people will either make a very crappy game and let it go for free or will simply abandon the software after realizing it requires a bunch of hours viewing fan-generated tutorial videos and reading fan-generated tips and hints. This leaves us with a minority of creators that will produce decent games and an extremely tiny minority that will make great, if not amazing games to remember. If you want to make such a game with RPG Maker, you really have to prepare yourself because you'll have to spend hundreds of hours on this project of yours. There's also a lot of trial-and-error in the way. It demands a lot of dedication, that's for sure. But that's not related to RPG Maker. It's the same scenario for anyone who wishes to make a video game, no matter the softwares being used.

I can't say I'm disappointed even though I do feel like I paid a little too much for this. But that's just me. It works. It truly does. But you'll have to work more than it does. Are you ready for it?"

I remembered I abandoned development on RM after RPG Maker XP start working with RGSS. It was flexible, but somehow I felt the scripting language was not modern and will be removed someday.

Now RPG Maker MV fully replaced RGSS with Javascript and it also support plugins, which greatly extend engine features.
After 10+ years of time, I purchased MV just for supporting the developers. Thanks Enterbrain.

2. Removed Midi support.
3. A completely new Character generator.
4. Plugins
5. MV lets you change the resolution of your game.

Speaking of the character generator, it's a COMPLETE upgrade from VX Ace. The faces look much better, and the sprites aren't that bad either. Paticularlly, the faces got a real face-lift.

So, with the exception of it's steep price tag, it's just like VX Ace, with some very well placed changes. If you have the money to afford it, it's defintely worth the price."

if anyone owns any of the RPG makers, they know about the skill damage formulas, and what a pain they are.

It would be nice if it included algebraic equation support, multiple stats affecting one attack variable, and all of this to be wrapped up in a nice easy to use GUI.

												RPG Maker MV is an a great addition to the RPG Maker Series. I first started using RPG Maker VX Ace approximately two years ago and it was then that I fell in love with the software.

As with RPG Maker VX Ace, MV offers the tools to make an old JRPG styled game with ease. Unlike Ace however, MV is built on JavaScript whilst Ace used Ruby. JavaScript is much more powerful and enables more flexibility in my opinion when it comes to creating/applying plugins. <--- Keep in mind that the scripting part is optional, you do not need any coding to be create an amazing RPG Game. Granted it does help add features to make your games unique.

Pros:
- Great Community: I absolutely love the RM Community, you can find tons of resources, tutorials and scripts to use in your projects. The community is quite active, so if you have any questions feel free to ask them.
- High Res - (48x48): Compared to VXAce, MV now has a resolution scale allowing for a higher level of quality for sprites and mapping. Always a nice addition.
- Tons of customisation options: The character generator has taken a big jump in flexibility since VXAce, allowing for more customisation of faces and sprites. Oh and you can import your own generator parts! The sprite sheets produced also contain more sprites for various situations, side battlers, damage etc.
- Easy to learn: As with all RMs, it's pretty easy to get around once you learn the basic functions.
- New Prebuilt Side Battler Mode: You can now take the side battler approach for your games as opposed to front facing approach (for battle sequences). This could only be achieved by using a custom script before.
- Export to Mac/Android/iOS/PC : A nice feature that enables you to export your commercial/non-commercial projects.

Cons:
I'm slightly biased as I absolutely love this software, but I have come across some minor issues that do create additional work when I'm creating my game.
- Bugs and Glitches: The software is still relatively new (relative to the original date of this review), so there are some minor bugs still present. In my case, I found some issues with the shadow tool. Certain shaded areas would render when the games were executed. These were usually fixed though by erasing and re-tiling the affected areas.

So do I recommend this software? Absolutely!!! Although, if you're new to the series, I suggest you start of with an older varient such as VX Ace which can usually be found for cheap during sales and on bundle sites such as Humble Bundle and Bundle Stars.

I give this software, 10/10."

												RPG Maker MV, is easily the very best of them all. There is plenty of negative reviews out there, and truth be told - even after reading a couple of them, I honestly do not know why they posted negatives. 

Anywyas, let's get to my own feelings about the program : 

I absolutely love it, pretty much everything has been improved on and moved into right direction. The changes for many aspects are pretty subtle, but quickly turn out to be a major time / stress savers.
That being said, among many and many pros of MV, absolutely the very best part are user-made plugins. You may ask, why would I give developers credits for user created content, and I'll respond with : It's the same as with the game supporting modding, and the one that does not. Sure you do not review mods when talking about the game, but you surely list modability as a (huge) plus. And in this case, they not only gave means to create plugins, they did all they could to find and contact very reliable and knowledgable people to work on them (eg. Yanfly whom already created 20 very helpful plugins)

The only thing you have to watch out for, before buying RPG maker MV is the fact it does require a bit better PC than the older versions did. The games created in the program are greatly optimised and working a lot better, but the RPG maker itself is visibly bigger strain on your PC. - But well, as long as you meet the requirements, you'll be fine.

I've been only working with MV for as few as 9 hours, but I haven't encoutered ANY bugs nor crashes to happen in this short time. I also have a feeling that I have already progressed further than in 70 hours spent in Vx Ace. 
Where the work didn't quite go like I wanted to before, now it's pretty much a pleasure, because everything is a LOT more user friendly. 

If you have been using older versions of the RPG maker, and are wondering wether to buy MV - Go for it. You will need to do some tinkering to get your old projects to work on the new system, because it uses different coding language, and different resolutions, but it's worth every second spent on converting.

IF you are completely new to RPG maker series... well you should probably see some review about the RPG maker itself before, but as long you feel you are motivated enough to create an actual game, you should definetely buy MV over other versions. And well, if you want to create 2D RPG games, I also claim RPG maker series being the very best, and cheapest of the programs you can use to create such games (at least counting these you can work efficently in)."

												A little disapointed but recommend if you can get it on sale.

The engine seems good but some basic things should have been done better. 

Cons:

*There should have been more monsters included without having to buy DLC. 
A matter of fact this engine is a DLC ♥♥♥♥♥. Seriously look at the amount of DLC there is and how much the total cost of all of it is. Insane!!!!
*Adding the DLC is a tedious process. You have to drag and drop all of the files into each folder manually....for EACH project.
*The tilesets arent bad but should have been expanded more. However the building tiles are improving.
*needs a sortable search feature for plugins.

Pros:

*Got it on sale
*The tilesets that are included are nice
*quick events
*javascripting/plugins
*resolution
*ability to deploy to android or ios (youtube how, it isnt hard)
*quick and easy to use and learn
*Lots of community help from other users"

												What can be said about a title that allows you to be the one to tell your own story through the media of RPG gameplay? I have used previous RPG Maker titles, but MV is my favorite thus far for a few reasons. There are a number of add-ons you can find and some titles with the right amount of work can come out very well. With this title, literally anyone is capable of making a decent game after mastering a few simple concepts. If they can find the commitment to finish...

I would reccomend this title to anyone who wishes to play around with making simple games and advancing their story telling skills but my reccomendation comes with a warning.

This is the first RPG Maker version that is Mac ""compatable."" I use quotes because on different Mac machines including a 2015 Macbook Pro Retina, the title suffers from an irritating crash issue. When editing events and typing dialogues, I cannot tell you how many times the title simply exits. No error message, no option to save work, no way to recover what you have done. To work around this as a Mac user, save frequently, and do not type longer dialogues without stopping multiple times to save. Other than that, this title works almost flawlessly doing what it was designed for."

												Bought this as a side project, now after the month line I've logged my 130th hour and counting.
When my first game launches I'm sure that it'll just be stratching the surface of the new tool I've stumbled across. Hooked already indefinitly and big plans for a set of games.
Easy to use, in the sense that anything you want to add to your game is dependant on your skill and effort, and most importantly on your ability to learn. I came into this with no coding knowledge and found myself at a disadvantage, until I learned and adapted myself. Anything is possible when you set your mind to it.
9/10
Everything you need except when you get into it nothing you need but everthing minus your work so good."

												I rather enjoy it. I got it on sale. I wouldn't quite recommend it at full price, unless you really want this engine that badly. Still, it's a fairly excellent engine. As I'm writing this review, there are a ridiculous amount of free plugins, and some even came with the engine. The plugins are a fun and easy method to customize your game when compared to the scripting methods of previous engines. I actually like the basic tilesets and music, even though I want more and more variety. Luckily, there are plenty of free resources to find on the Internet if you look hard enough. There is also a bunch of DLC on Steam if you're willing to fork over some cash. The Steam Workshop also has a few things. As time goes on, the RPG Maker community will no doubt provide you with more to work with. Now, if you don't know anything about how to use an RPG Maker engine, especially not this MV version, then go to YouTube. There are quite a few fun tutorials to watch. Some are broad and some are very specific. This engine itself runs beautifully with my crappy toaster of a computer. So, there's that. My favorite thing to do with this engine is mapping. Just ... mapping. It pleases my brain."

RPG Maker VX Ace was a fantastic piece of software. This has then blown the ship out of the water.

												Disclosure: I spent 700+ hours in RPG Maker VX Ace, and I pre-ordered via the official website.

So, I've been developing a game in VX Ace; and now I decided to move on to MV after pre-ordering it (forgive me), and I gotta say; this is actually a great program. Awesome to see sideview battlers integrated within the game, although I wish enemies had their own sideview animations so it's more like Final Fantasy VI.

Pros:
-Great first program.
-Awesome, more improved generator.
-Pre-order DLC is glorious.
-A higher resolution.
-Move to Javascript, which means no more using an unfamiliar language or having to learn a whole new language. This will certainly welcome in some new developers who are also learning Javascript.
-Plugins. You can still edit them with Notepad/Notepad++ but I find the plugin system nice, as you can now edit things without worrying about editing this one line of code ♥♥♥♥ing up your game or making it do a CTD.
-Same interface RM users are very familiar with, which means RMMV is welcoming for newcomers and veterans alike.
-More things to spice up.
-Great base/DLC soundtrack and graphics. Some songs even give the Hotline Miami/Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon vibe.
-Addition of an options menu, even featuring the ability to turn down music and sound. Yanfly also made plugins for customizing controls, thank god; as WASD > Arrow Keys.

Cons:
-Smaller database than VX Ace. This should be a non-issue if you like building things yourself. (UPDATE: You can download the full database here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17078211/RMMV_data.rar )
-Character generator gradients kinda suck. You can edit the gradients with Paint.NET/PhotoShop/GIMP; which I've done later on. Non-issue if you plan to use custom graphics.
-Lack of native true Linux support. Granted, Android is based off of Linux and Crosswalk exists but still.
-Older computers should stay away for now.
-VX Ace to MV converter is kinda not worth it, I just converted some of my databases over and started from scratch.
-Removal of formula generators when setting damage.
-No exiting to desktop integrated, but http://steamcommunity.com/app/363890/discussions/3/483368526580177984/ - Fixes this issue.
-Some plugins need to be installed to fix some flaws.
-Lack of FLAC and MP3. MP3 is no longer supported but you can convert to OGG easily with Audacity.

Score: 9.0/10. MV is, despite its flaws improved over VX Ace.  I do hope more is added but I'm pretty satisfied with it; and I hope to see it improve as it develops."

Either way, it's good when you can use it."

												I do like this new version although it does have it's pitfalls. I'll just list some pros and cons and my opinion on changes and also why it is still worth buying.

Pros:
-Very nice interface, cleaner than VXA, more default customizability
-The plugin manager is awesome! (see cons too!)
-Uses javascript!
-The character generator is awesome! generates side battlers and just feels more customizable than VXA.
-Export to mobiles, HTML5, and PC/Mac
-Higher resolution!
-Side battle view is awesome!

Cons:
-I'm not a fan of the chibi like characters
-The plugin manager sometimes doesnt show all the changable variables
(ex: Yanfly Battle engine core forces stars above attacked things, uneditable in the manager)
-Very few Assets unlike in VXA, Item icons wise you get practically nothing
-Some of the enemy pics are rediculously HUGE and very cartoony
-I HATE the plus minus zoom buttons, SLIDER (with mouse scroll controls) PLEASE!!!

To summerize it is still an amazing piece of software and the cons can be worked around just by creating your own assets.

What I want to see:
-official templates for an item sheet/other assets. This would make it easier for everyone to make thier own assets especially since making your own items is a near necessity.
-A Slider for the zoom
-A dark theme! I hate brightness in my software :)"

												I'm really enjoying my time with MV, and find it the best maker yet. I've come from XP, to VX, to ACE and love all the improvements implemented in MV compared to them; especially now that MV is using Javascript, and includes the option for a sideview battle via a click of a button. Overall, there's so much to do, and the included resources give you enough to make your very own game, which you can then port to Android, iOS or even play it in your web browser via HTML5!

For the price, this really is the best bang for buck in RPG game development and whether you're young or old, it's always good to learn new skills and try a new hobby, this will teach you graphics and creativity, storytelling, javascript, mapping, puzzle building, problem solving and much more.

Give it a go! Happy RPGmaking!"

Also with enthusiastic RPG Maker fans who keep asks and also answers, and some known RPG Maker plugin makers that keep trying to customize even further with their (newly) JavaScript plugins I believe the future of RPG Maker will be more shines than before.

												Stick with VXAce.Trust me. It's really not worth it. Sure, the face generator, side-view system, and resolution are better, but it doesn't make up for the fact that it doesn't do as advertised. There is no easy way of porting to Android/iOS. The HTML5 didn't work for me. And honestly, I think that VXAce looks better than MV. If they fix these problems in the future, I'll buy it again. But for now, I think it's time to try out Steam's refund service"

												Well, I can tell there was ALOT of love put into RPG Maker MV. It's like RPG Maker ACE, but of course, have it's present differences:
1. Javescript instead of RGSS
2. Removed Midi support.
3. A completely new Character generator.
4. Plugins
5. MV lets you change the resolution of your game.

Speaking of the character generator, it's a COMPLETE upgrade from VX Ace. The faces look much better, and the sprites aren't that bad either. Paticularlly, the faces got a real face-lift.

So, with the exception of it's steep price tag, it's just like VX Ace, with some very well placed changes. If you have the money to afford it, it's defintely worth the price."

												Although on the surface MV might look ""the same"", but underneath the hood it's a completely different beast. MV outshines everything Ace has and out does it on several levels. Thanks to Javascript and a open UI, programming is MUCH more flexible and will allow more possibilities with the engine then what Ruby could provide. Plus just basic changes with the default engine itself: Better Default Resolution (By default 1K, but with Yanfly's Core Plugins it can be set to 2K and higher), An more organized database to easily go through the tabs and change what you need, and the best part for last, An In-Game editor. As someone who pays close attention to detail when ever I had to playtest a game and saw something that needed changing, you had to close the game, bring back up the editor, change it, and go back to the area to see the fix. This was specially annoying when it was during a long cutscene. And when it was multiple
problems it's hard to remember what needs fixing or tweaking when going back to the editor, so you could be stuck going back and forth for hours trying to fix the problem. But thanks to the In-Game editor I can easily fix something while the game still runs without having to go back and forth. This cuts down on development time signifcantly. I highly recommand this for anyone new to the RM scene, returning veterns, or upgraders of older RM engines looking for more possibilities."

												I want to write an actual constructive review , but some people have already exposed the good and bad points in the review section . So , to make short :

Cons : 
_No RTP anymore , every new project will take the whole 400Mb to make , even for a little test thing
_Including outside content now requires to be done manually , while it could be done with a simple button inside the program in previous versions
_Same goes for script editing , the tool isn't here and you have to includes external scripts
_[NOTICED AND BEING FIXED BY DEVS] Changing the variable of status alterations makes the program crash . Devs are aware and fixing it .
(_I've also heard that converting games for android and all wasn't as easy as it was sadi

Now for the pros :
_Graphically fine , new Science-Fiction tilesets , graph and all are also a nice new elements , allowing to make decent utopian worlds 
_a GOOD character/face editor , with decent features unlike the horrible things that were predominant in VX Ace's one , also allowing you to put several characters in a simple sheet and to save samples
_Included 2d combat system (you could do that with scripts in VX for exemple , but I remember it used to crash sometimes , in here it's stable)
_Keeps all the usual features from other RPG makers , minus the ones described in the cons .
_Bigger default resolution for games , more detailed default sprites !
_That's a personal thinking , but the default musics included are better than before . (VX ones were good but VX Ace's were honestly ... idk , not as good ?)



It all depends what you're looking for . Saying it is easier than ever to make games sounds a bit like a lie considering how some of the options were removed , but all in all you still can do them by yourself , the base ressources are good , the char generator is very good and the side battle brings a refreshing change . Personally , I'm satisfied with my order !"

*It could crash it did for me once.
*Sometimes i do wish there were more rescources.
*No rescource tab like there wasin vx ace
*Sad for me especially no quick damage calculator feature.
*The character generator is good but there is not too many different parts to use especially for beast ears and tail.

												First, I'm just excited this has finally come to Mac.  It's great to have as somebody that hasn't played around with other RPG Makers, besides the ones on PSX and PS2.  So I can't speak to what's improved or worsened from VX, etc.:  I'm just excited I have something rather than nothing, so I give it a 10/10 on that front alone, in addition to being able to port to Android and iOS.

Second, I really enjoy this software.  The base assets are great for someone who doesn't want to map, draw, or make their own sounds/music.  Sideview is very cool.  The whole thing looks great, sounds great, plays great.  I really have no idea where the lag complaints are coming from:  I have no lag or loading times between things, but maybe that's because I'm not intentionally trying to create 99999x99999 tile boards like some people are trying.

Things are generally easy to ""code"" and put together in that it is very WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get.)  I use this software at my afterschool program to teach STEM concepts so I can say that even Middle Schoolers can get a grasp of things fairly soon if you give them some direction.  Plugins seem to really give you the ability to unlock the full potential of everything, but I am no expert and have only tried to the ""plug this in to change this"" simple plugins.  I have not created anything complex.

TL;DR:  Buy this if you're on a Mac.  Buy this if you want to create something that looks very high-end with not much effort.  Buy this is you're teaching coding to kids."

												Things I liked:

Character Generator, along with a Side-View Generator
Music is decent
Scripting Galore
Plenty of Tutorials
Liked the addition of a dark/gray HUD
Basically everything is upgraded from previous RPG Makers

Things I didn't like:
There isn't a side-view battler for every character they give. So no Fairy party members (if side-view battling).
The DLC leaves a LOT to be desired. As in, you can totally just buy the software and not lose much, if anything.


Don't take TOO much stock in my review, since all I did so far was make a Prologue to my game. Which still isn't finished. Should I find anything else interesting, I might just change my review. However, chances are pretty high that I'll forget I made a review in the first place.

												Missing some essential features. Most annoing is the inability to reorder your game scenes, so if you decided one secene should come befoe another or, if you need to add a scene in-between two scenes, you're out of luck. Using tilesets is confusing, and you can't really mix two tilesets in the same scene. The features are there, but you're expected to use the forums and follow tutorials if you want to find anything as nothing is clearly labled. 

I would not recommend this for newcommers unless you really have the time and drive to put in the effort to learn this program. The cost is high so if you're looking for a program to just mess around in, this probably isn't it unless you have a bigge prroject in mind. 

I WILL say that I have made more progess on an idea than with any other ""free"" game making app and I am happy it is avaiable for mac. If you can handle the steep learning curve and you have an aversion to hard coding, this could be for you but I would urge the developers to add some more friendly features."

												I would not recommend this or any ""cookie-cutter"" game maker software to someone who wants to produce a finished commercial product.  When it comes to RPGs these days, you need more than a tremendous story/characters/dialogue or else your product will never get noticed.  When you use ""cookie-cutter"" game makers, that story aspect is the only originality you can provide.

But within certain contexts, RPG Maker MV is simply amazing.  I want to spend a year designing maps, story, characters and dialogue for my RPG.  Most of the original aspects to my proposed product revolve around audio and combat, which aren't possible with RPG Maker MV.  Hard to tell if your proposed story/character mechanics will work until you play them, and it's hard to motivate to spend a year coding software (for me, AGK2) so I can BEGIN playtesting the story.

No chicken n' egg problem if you have something like RPG Maker MV.  You can develop both simultaneously, because it's so simple to work with RPG Maker MV.  

So if you're approaching RPG making like I am, I can't recommend this enough.  I'm only a half hour in and I've already got most of the basics down (to emphasize, I have a coding background which aids with immediately understanding certain structures that RPG Maker MV is essentially a shell for, even though it's not involving direct coding at all).  If you're looking for something that will be the final product, and sell it for money, I'd have to roll my eyes, yes, yes."

												If you are aspiring to learn or know javascript and want to make a visual novel, rpg, or tile-based game, you will not be able to put this down. 

As a developer trying to make commercial, sellable products, I stayed away from RPG Maker...but now I can tell you that they have fixed virtually every gripe that I had with RPG Maker VX Ace.

+ HD movie support, finally, so I can design 2d or 3d animated cutscenes.
+ Remap keys, so you can remap it to WASD to move. 
+ Use with Netbeans
+ Many many user scripts
+ Export to just about anything if you know what you're doing.
+ Instant test with your web browser, or it's internal player and F5.
+ html5/javascript is a very common language, and will help people move to Unity as well afterwards.
+ It's easier to debug, using web developer tools with F8.

The only gripe I have is that you can't disable Alt+F4 on desktop computers, so you will have to either make an auto-save script."

												I honestly love this software, I really do. but it is lacking some things.

if anyone owns any of the RPG makers, they know about the skill damage formulas, and what a pain they are.
If anyone ever used the damage formula simplifier, they should know that it was a complete pain.
Now, that was the past, I was really hoping for a more advanced version of the simplifier.
I can't really complain much about this, especially since I had recieved this product for less than half of its cost.
But I can say that I'd like to be able to use something like a FREE system where i enter my variables and it spits out what i need to put in the box where the formula.

It would be nice if it included algebraic equation support, multiple stats affecting one attack variable, and all of this to be wrapped up in a nice easy to use GUI.

And before you begin, yes this sounds like total first world problems, and I'm not gonna lie, this is.

This is really the only reason I don't reccomend this amazing program.

Sinceramente amo este software, de verdad. pero se carece de algunas cosas.

si alguien es dueño de cualquiera de los fabricantes de RPG, que saben acerca de las fórmulas de la habilidad, y lo que es un dolor que son.
Si alguien utiliza el simplificador formula de daño, deben saber que era un completo dolor.
Ahora, eso era el pasado, yo estaba realmente esperando por una versión más avanzada de la simplificador.
No puedo quejar mucho sobre esto, sobre todo desde que había recibido este producto por menos de la mitad de su coste.
Pero puedo decir que me gustaría ser capaz de usar algo como un sistema libre que le meto mi variables y escupe lo que necesito para poner en la caja donde la fórmula.

Sería bueno si se incluyó el apoyo algebraica ecuación, múltiples estadísticas que afectan a una variable ataque, y todo esto para ser envuelto en una bonita interfaz gráfica de usuario fácil de usar.

Y antes de empezar, si esto suena como el total de los primeros problemas del mundo, y yo no voy a mentir, esto es.

												I am really happy to have purchased this. This isn't the first time I've used RPG Maker, though it is the first time I have bought it for myself. Most of the time I used other people's copies to mess around and help with some story writing. Not that I have my own version, I am very pleased with the amount of options i have as for putting games together, and that's helpful since I am mostly a writer. Being able to create my own characters makes it easier for me to build my worlds and focus on my storytelling."

												Still early, lots of new plug-ins etc will be on the way. Those that have placed bad reviews are probably too impatient to create a game. This sucks away your soul in a pretty good way. Looking forward to good stuff with this version. Yes, there are issues, but the good outweighs the bad. If you decide to hold off, that's fine. It's only going to get better from here. Please try not to pay too much attention to bad reviews. Once you get a grasp on the software, it's tons of fun. I caught on quick and haven't designed a game since RPG Maker 2003, so don't get too worried if you haven't played previous installments. Most of the engine has stayed true to its older versions with the layout and event setups. Best of luck on your projects!"

This is not a game, it isn't something to play from time to time when you're bored and expect to make something that is amazing.

												Missing some essential features. Most annoing is the inability to reorder your game scenes, so if you decided one secene should come befoe another or, if you need to add a scene in-between two scenes, you're out of luck. Using tilesets is confusing, and you can't really mix two tilesets in the same scene. The features are there, but you're expected to use the forums and follow tutorials if you want to find anything as nothing is clearly labled. 

I would not recommend this for newcommers unless you really have the time and drive to put in the effort to learn this program. The cost is high so if you're looking for a program to just mess around in, this probably isn't it unless you have a bigge prroject in mind.

												A lot of the negative comments about RMMV are from people who haven't taken the time to work out how to use the new engine. The character generator is excellent, much improved over VXAce, and allows you to quickly and easily make a variety of faces, field sprites and animated battlers with a few clicks. Furthemore, these graphics do not clash with the default resources (most of which are in a separate folder in DLC, to keep the file size of new projects down). the Database now starts off with only a handful of default weapons, skills and enemies, although all th animations are still there, and there are still a variety of reources included, they're just in ""BaseResource"" your DLC folder by default, something which a user can easily remedy by moving them to the ""NewData"" Folder, essentially allowing one to create a custom RTP with all the files one normally would import into any new project. 

Instead of RGSS Scripts, a new Java based plugin system is used. As someone with no programming knowledge, I much prefer this, as you can customise these much more easily. The included bonus plugins for the english release add a wealth of new features and optional tweaks, and are likewise incredibly customisable, using easy to understand menus rather than having to search through walls of code to find out how to change the size of a window or make a character move around the screen in battle animations for example. There are more than 40 plugins included in your DLC folder FOR FREE with every copy of RMMV, and the amount of things you can do with them is mesmerising. Now you can easily have skills cost HP, alter the menu and save screens, upgrade weapons, limit items, increase the default maximums, have text boxes that word wrap (FINALLY!), make the battle camera pan and zoom, have enemies chase you round the map, and just SOOOOO much more. My one criticism is that not inluding all these resources in each new project folder does mean that some people can get the impression that they don't exist. This is the best and most flexible version of RPG maker yet, and I've been using it since XP came out."

												Positives:

1- It's resolution is unlocked (Altought you need plugins like Yanfly's Core plugin to anable them for example).

2- Plugin system makes it easier to avoid errors for people who don't know how to code but  want to use someone else's code.

3- It brings features back from RPG Maker 2003 like the sideview battles and event chasing, making this engine like a fusion between RPG Maker VX Ace and RPG Maker 2003.

4- Using Javascript may bring in more coders since it's a more known language than Rubyscript.

5- Assets resolution got increased along with the characters etc. Included sprites are 48x48 for example.

Negatives:

1- This is not a $80 USD egine since outside of the returning features from 2003 and the higther resolution, it's mainly just  a improved version of RPG Maker VX Ace. Most of the value comes from what the community's coders had done and not Enterbrain (Yanfly's Core Engines for example) yet each new engine costs $10 USD more than the previous.  Get this on a steam sale like I did.

2- The Automatic layering is a improvement over VX Ace but I want full control of the layers like I had on RPG Maker XP. This is the only thing that I miss the most of XP. I don't know why they removed this feature.

3- There's not options to make a full scrolling over world map. Many go around this by placing a bunch of teleporters around the map but it shoud not be this way, it should scroll giving the world the form of a donut like RPGs had been in the past. I don't even think it's possible for coders to add this functionality by making a Map Core script.

Conclusion:

This is the strongest of all the PC RPG Maker egines ever released and the only one who can support HD resolutions. (A core plugin is requiered.) Since it's new it will take a while before it is as supported as VX ACE but it is slowly reaching there. Also to get assets you may want to subscribe to their principal page. There's also some resources here on Steam as well, so just browse around.

If I where to rate this game, I would give it 8/10  or 3.5/5"

												So I checked out this Game on the Free Weekend... 

I have used like almost all the RPG Makers out there... 

Here is what i've noticed... 

RPG Maker 2k3 seems the best in Features, but programming is pretty good, 
but not great... It has a lot of features implemented already... 

RPG Maker XP is an Improvement, but the Graphix are more old school, 
& not a good... 

RPG Maker VX however drops some features, but it includes a more advanced 
Programming system this time around, & Graphix has improved... 

RPG Maker VX Ace drops even more features, but improves Programming 
even more... 

RPG Maker MV drops alot of features, but adds Java Script & Multi OS 
Support... 




All in all, i'd probably stick to RPG Maker 2k3, or XP, or RPG Maker VX, but if you want to 
Program for other OS, then MV is for you... 

I personally like 2k3 the best, but also use VX, sometimes... =D"

												""Mom look! I made a game!""

In all seriousness, RPG Maker MV is a pretty solid game-making tool. RPG Maker games have been given a bad reputation for being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fangames, and most of them are... But then someone comes out of no where with something real neato. 

But I suppose I should talk about the actual program, right?

As the name implies, you make RPG's. You can only make RPG's, because it's RPG Maker. It comes with a whole bunch of default music, tilesets, enemy sprites, and even a character generator. All are free for commercial use. You can obviously import custom graphics and music if you're an artist or musician. I'm not, so I just upload ♥♥♥♥♥ that I made in MS Paint.

10/10 would make RPG's again.

If you don't want to fall under the stereotype of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fangame RPG, then I would recommend importing custom stuff. I would also recommend the use of Plugins. Yes, Plugins. If you know javascript, you can write and import any kind of plugin to spice up your game a bit. Or if you have no idea how to do a javascript, you can just take some plugins off of the forums, provided that they're free to use. I highly recommend using plugins by Yanfly, because they make some real neato plugins that are real neato, and free for commercial use. These can be anything from easier menu management, or completely changing the battle system. 

RPG Maker requires no actual programming. Did I mention that? RPG Maker uses something similar to Scratch. It's hard to describe, so I won't. Look at the screenshots or some ♥♥♥♥ idk.

RPG Maker MV can export to Windows, Mac, iPhone or Android. The hard part about exporting to iPhone is getting that sonofa♥♥♥♥♥ onto the appstore, because ♥♥♥♥ Apple. You can charge a price, or put it out for free. Just make sure the stuff you use is free for commercial use if you decide to sell your ♥♥♥♥ game.

RPG Maker MV is some good ♥♥♥♥. Ever since I got RPG Maker, I've gotten so many ladies that I'm practically drowning. Now you can trick people into thinking you're a game designer but in reality you make ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sonic fan-RPG's. 

10/10 would make meme games again."

												I have many more hours than this shows. Far too many hours than I would care to share.  That being said I have a perfect love hate relationship with MV. On one hand it is a blast to use. It brings back found memories of old school game play. On the other hand if it was not like people like Yanfly MV would sputter and fade into the background pretty fast. Thankfully there is a huge community of users that are not only helpful they know this program inside and out.
Catch this on sale and it is a steal. Even at full price it has paid for itself a few times over with me. If you have used passed versions there have taken many of the positives from those and brought them here to MV. MV is the next evolution of the RPG series and a welcome collection to the tools that I have."

												From the first few hours of derping around with this game (as with every RPG maker prior) This has left quite an impact on me. Content wise is vastly better then Ace and VX, with quite an intresting Character generator that i want to tamper with a little, see if i can make a whole set of new sprite types. The plugin system takes a bit of getting use to but i see it as a great way to get deeper into coding and scripting when you feel ready for it, or experimenting with some amazing scripts to enhance that game. i may update this little reviewishy thing since i wanna get deeper into this but i would say if your mind is creative, go for it and make a game with this. tools are there, the drive is all you need now."

It's awesome to learn how RPGs work (I can explain how most RPGs work to my friends) by using this software.

												Although on the surface MV might look ""the same"", but underneath the hood it's a completely different beast. MV outshines everything Ace has and out does it on several levels. Thanks to Javascript and a open UI, programming is MUCH more flexible and will allow more possibilities with the engine then what Ruby could provide. Plus just basic changes with the default engine itself: Better Default Resolution (By default 1K, but with Yanfly's Core Plugins it can be set to 2K and higher), An more organized database to easily go through the tabs and change what you need, and the best part for last, An In-Game editor. As someone who pays close attention to detail when ever I had to playtest a game and saw something that needed changing, you had to close the game, bring back up the editor, change it, and go back to the area to see the fix. This was specially annoying when it was during a long cutscene. And when it was multiple
problems it's hard to remember what needs fixing or tweaking when going back to the editor, so you could be stuck going back and forth for hours trying to fix the problem. But thanks to the In-Game editor I can easily fix something while the game still runs without having to go back and forth. This cuts down on development time signifcantly. I highly recommand this for anyone new to the RM scene, returning veterns, or upgraders of older RM engines looking for more possibilities."

												RPG Maker advertizes itself as being simple enough for a child, but powerful enough for a professional. As someone who has herself programmed games the hard way, I can assure you that this statement is true. For the new game developer, RPG Maker provides a nice framework to understand how mechanics and gameplay can mesh with story and helps learn the basics of game design - how to telegraph things to your players, how to make enemies an appropriate strength, etc.
For those who know how to do that, RPG Maker trims the fat, saving you the time of having to program different elemental types while still giving you the option to modify it if you want.
And that, I think, is the power of this tool. It presents you with so many options to get you started, but can do so much more if you know how to code."

*Support fo rmultiple platforms.
CONS >:(
*It could crash it did for me once.
*Sometimes i do wish there were more rescources.
*No rescource tab like there wasin vx ace
*Sad for me especially no quick damage calculator feature.
*The character generator is good but there is not too many different parts to use especially for beast ears and tail.

But there's so much missing that it does not feel right. At all. I didn't need the ""sound test"" this includes - VX Ace had something similar to that. However, I do need an assets menu to make importing custom features easier. I do need an easy way to access scripts. I do need some way to import a VX Ace project to MV so I don't have to restart everything. I do need the ability to disable the RTP to make the download size smaller. At least include the characters from the cover art in the actual software instead of DLC, you know?! It's very new, but there are far too many problems for me to just accept it. Simply put, it feels nowhere near complete, ditches some of the most useful parts of VX Ace, and doesn't really bother making up for the things it scrapped."

												Overall its a good framework to make a 2d rpg or even a VN. Most of the limitations can be overcome with javascript. You can do a total graphical overhaul so it looks nothing like an rpg maker game. The problem with programming a game from scratch is organizing all the game data (weapons, items, enemies) and figuring out all the damage formulas which is a tedious boring task that rpg maker covers for you.

the event creator is kind of limiting though. There are some commands that let you choose an actor or an item with a variable while other commands only let you pick from a static list when it should let you use a variable as well. You can still circumvent it by writing javascript but its a little inconvinient. i hope the devs could change this."

												=Edit= [The newest version has come out but the points of this review still stand. The update has added things, fixed bugs and textures. Fixed autowalls and more. The review however focused on other problems that I have myself and therefor the review still stands as what it is.]

So my reviews normaly tend to be longer but since this is still updating, I will not go in with a big review.

So far it is very interesting to say the least. The Program is completly different to the ones before and yet stood similar sort of. Now before you are getting confused: The game overall is the same but does things completly different. The Layers are not just two anymore. Instead we have two layers with an artificial third one.

You can place the groundlayer and put something on the object layer. In VX and Ace you would have to use a event to put another object above it and in MV it simply does it without the event. Meaning that placing a Puppet and then a chair infront of it wont make the puppet disappear like before in the VX and Ace versions. This will make mapping much easier especially for the ones not used to use Parallax over normal mapping. (Placing another object above the two placed ones will make it disapear though.)

The next thing is Javascript over Ruby. Now while I like a sorting system I dont think the change to Javascript makes a big difference. It probably is a bit easier to learn since more commonly known but still. The plugin sorting system though is a nice addition and it means that you wont have to download the scripts over and over again. Simply copy the files and activate them.

The character generator is a thing that I am only OK with. Overall the quality is amazing but I really liked the old look of the VX and VXAce characters. Of course that doesnt mean that it has to stay like that forever but I feel like the characters are a bit out of place. Especially with the addition of the sort of Kaduki Battlesystem. Maybe its just that I am used to the old character sprites but that is how I think about it.

The Tilesets. The Tilesets are... They are... Lets just point it out: They are meh.
Overall its nice looking and good quality and the addition of having modern tiles is just as good but it just doesnt look as good anymore. Overall the quality of the tilesets is very good. But we didnt have new texture formats since XP and I thought that was the way to go. They were RPGs and should look simple. Now they look just more detailed than the ones we had before and that is it. I will have to live with it but that doesnt mean that I will keep quiet about it.

A new addition I do like a lot however is the zoom. It makes things much easier for mapping. I always wanted to zoom in further to see everything a bit better to go in with a few more details just for that little area but couldnt. I wanted to focus on that one area on the map but couldnt. Now I can so that is most certainly a good one.

The last thing I want to cover is the lack of Weapons, Monsters and Skills. This of course could be added in a future update but right now it isnt in so I will adress it. For me it was always hard to get into this RPG Maker thing. I didnt want to watch silly Tutorials, shouldve done it though, and went straight into the menu to find it out myself. Most of the stuff I know I actually taught myself by looking at the program so its actually easy to learn. But with MV we have one part of that where I say that the old programs did it better.
Weapons, Monsters and Skills. There are barely any right now and its kind of a problem. I mean you have your basic stuff which is good and we are able to use it but not more. Not knowing what kind of stuff can be used with this different program makes it even more complicated in that case and requires you to actually go and for a hit and miss.
I hope they will update the game on this part, which I am sure they will but still.

And thats about it so far. Program is decent and usable but for those that wonder if they should buy it, I would say: Wait for now. Keep your money and just wait. Updates are coming in and that means things are going to change. Not by a lot but atleast by a bit.

												A massive list of major improvements make it worth your while!	
I LOVE RPG Maker MV. I've started a brand new project with it, and there's just so many moments where I'm like ""Wow..."" or ""Cool!"" or ""No Way!"" It's just designed so much better so your life while using it is that much less of a headache. It's extremely powerful and much more functional then any previous version of RM, even Ace. There's so many things about it that make you feel like, ""If only Ace had had this, it would have made my life, and my game, so much better."" And that's why it's so good. 

 PROS 
    A brilliant new GUI
    A fabulous new Character Editor - includes side view battler, the ability to save your character and come back to it
    Interwoven with Javascript - a major improvement over Ruby. The plugin system is a lifesaver. It just presents all of your options and parameters for you  
    Absolutely gorgeous built-in assets, so you can get straight into making your game and it looks GOOD
    Side-view battle!
    Event searcher! This will undoubtedly save my life
    Craploads of little additions like allowing enemies to appear mid-way through a battle, and other things that would require annoying scripting otherwise
    Tons of performance improvements for both the engine and the game itself
    Mac Support! Yay Mac users!
    iOS and Android export may take some effort, but BUILT-IN TOUCH SUPPORT AND EMULATION IS SO COOL
 CONS 

    It's crashed on me a couple times already. That is frightening.
    It's kind of annoying that I had to install the DLC and full database myself. Was worth it though.
    Little extra features like auto-aligining troops for side-view, more built-in battle customization and a NORMAL LOOKING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BROWN EYE COLOUR WOULD BE NICE

In all seriousness, though, it's amazing. Sure you gotta do some of the work yourself, but this is GAME DEVELOPMENT SOFTWARE people! If you didn't come with the intentions of getting your hands dirty, you're in the wrong place!

I'm SUPER excited for how this software will develop in the coming months both from the development side and the community side, and I'm really looking forward to making incredible games with this baby!

Do you want to make games? Yes: Buy this.
Do you like previous versions of RPG Maker, but want more? Yes: Buy this.
Do you want to stop reading this long-♥♥♥ review and just buy it already? YES!!!!!!! BUY IT!"

												I have many more hours than this shows. Far too many hours than I would care to share.  That being said I have a perfect love hate relationship with MV. On one hand it is a blast to use. It brings back found memories of old school game play. On the other hand if it was not like people like Yanfly MV would sputter and fade into the background pretty fast. Thankfully there is a huge community of users that are not only helpful they know this program inside and out.
Catch this on sale and it is a steal. Even at full price it has paid for itself a few times over with me. If you have used passed versions there have taken many of the positives from those and brought them here to MV. MV is the next evolution of the RPG series and a welcome collection to the tools that I have."

												While there are issues with MV, there are a lot of great bits and pieces and the fact that the developers are trying to meet the needs of those who are using the program is a big plus for a series where such commitment to the customer is quite new.

A powerful engine if you know what you're doing, it is also quite easy to pick up and make something with - and with some very nice assets for people to use as they grow and learn more about game development, it really is one of the best new-dev software out there."

												The HTML5/web export opens up amazing possibilities. The game is basically playable on everything that runs a sufficiently modern web browser, including Linux. If you liked the previous RPG Maker installments, this one is definitely worth getting for that alone. (This also allows playing the game streamed in the web browser as part of some web page without being required to bother with a full download)

Please beware though that the program is a bit on the expensive side: RPG Maker is best for making a specific type of RPG, and if you don't make sure this matches your expectations you're probably gonna be disappointed that you have put all the money into it, so make sure to try the trial first before you buy!

												I'm in love with this. Absolutely. 100%.
I came to this one from RPGMaker XP because it was on sale, and I had wanted it for awhile. It was a HUGE step up, and I would have easily paid full-price for it and started using it months ago if I had known it was going to be this fun. After transitioning from XP, I figured I had a lot to learn, but learning the new UI it just became second-nature. I'm not sure about people comparing MV and Ace, as I have never used Ace, but it is easy enough to work around and I am still learning new things all the time. I'm only 39 hours into this RPGMaker, but the entire time has been spent on a single game that I was working on from XP. The tilesets leave much to be desired, as coming from XP there was a huge assortment, but there's enough there to work with without feeling like DLC is a must. Also, Workshop integration is nice. I haven't downloaded anything yet, but I think that with a little more time it might start filling up.

TL;DR- If you wanted to make RPG games, I'd say this would be a great first step, but you may think about picking up one of the cheaper titles to get a feel for how it all goes together. If this much was thrown at me at once going in blind like I did with XP, I probably would have given up."

I wouldn't purchase it at full price, but it's definitely a very handy, well made program.  Do yourself a favor and find a lot of assets for free on various websites and learn through youtube how to add them, and how to actually use the program.

Either way, it's fun, but too many people end up making a crap game and think they can sell it on steam for $5."

												This is the most powerful RPG Maker yet and it is filled to the bring with options for customizing everything and creating your game exactly how you want it. Contrary to the title, you definitely don't have to make RPG games with this, you can make basically anything you can dream of (provided it's 2D). Now with the simple encryption methods like the previous makers had and the resource manager, I would recommend this to EVERYONE looking to create their very first game and any amount of games after that. I will always stick by the RPG Maker name as long as they keep putting out amazing products such as this one. Top notch!"

It has more options for the character generator that actually match the default characters, the screen is bigger, and there are more options for tilesets and music.

Can't really say much else about it.

What I will say is one naggitive that seems not to work 
Encrypting your game. 
does not work for me, no matter how hard I try.

Does not mean this is a bad engine to make your game.
So if you like spending lots of time making your own game.
I would say buy it. If you rather play games and not make them.
don't buy it. simply see what others who did buy this made for you to play.

												Love, love, LOVE it.

RPG Maker has always been the go-to game maker for those who want to get started in expressing their creativity without learning complex programming languages, and over the course of the last few installments it's grown considerably in flexibility thanks to the introduction of scripting and plugins.

RPG Maker MV's use of JavaScript-based plugins is by far the most elegant solution the developer has come up with to extending the engine's functionality yet. No more accidentally putting scripts in the wrong place -- though in some cases, the order in which you load the plugins matters -- and no more configuration by delving into scary-looking script, thanks to dedicated plugin parameter windows.

Even if you don't want to delve into the more complex aspects of customisation with plugins, RPG Maker MV remains the same easy to use package that it's always been. The mapping and eventing systems will be immediately familiar to series veterans -- though some will miss the ""layers"" approach to mapping -- and the included resources are of high quality. A particular shout out to the included music, which is particularly good; Shoji Meguro would be proud of the wailing electric guitars on display in some of the battle themes.

Combine all that with the fact that you can now export your games to Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and HTML5 and you have a formidable package for getting started in game development. Even if you never bring your grand designs to the commercial market, if nothing else RPG Maker is a great means of learning the basic logic of programming and how to tell your computer to do things. For some, it will be enough to realise their dreams; for others, it will be a stepping stone to more complex tools and techniques.

Either way, if you have the slightest interest in making games, pick this up. And be sure to check out the community content, too; there's already a ton of great resources and plugins available, many of which are completely free to use in both commercial and non-commercial products."

												I never really wrote a review in any rpg maker I own considering that I worked a lot on them but I felt like doing one on MV since it had some very disappointing features.

Do I recommend this software ? 

YES and NO 

Yes if you want to make a game on that genre, and found the software on a really cheap deal
NO if you want to create something different, or have good experience with programming and designing.

What you can find in MV that didn't exist in all the previous versions is javascript support.

It can ""Create"" Android, web, IOS, Windows games, HOWEVER You have to do ALL The work yourself on converting it to each platform and trust me its a lot of work, you'd have to download and install a lot of environments, then set their paths, then run a CMD with a long code that you get, then wait it to convert it, then test the ""APK android for example"" 
Then you open it in your mobile and turns out the resolution and texts are messed up so you have to do it again.

Even after doing all those steps you'll probably encounter an issue due to the SDK's updating and you'll spend hours trying to sort it out.

Another disappointment was the lack of workshop support.

Whats sad is that we finally have mobile support and the software does not support it by itself you do all the work, they did not even include a method to add buttons on the mobile screen or anything, they just simply made it sort of like ""Open source"" type so the community creates codes to do that, and most of the time those plugins you download online will conflict with other plugins and messes up the game so you'd have to delete them.

Then you'd have to find another way to add your customized features, and do it all over again.


OVERALL 

Get this software on a great cheap deal, and use it if you'd want to develop games that follows the genre of this software, otherwise just get game maker studio or anything else if you're already good at designing since that software does not really need any programming experience.

Honestly, after I am done with creating the game I am working on I will never touch this software again or any other rpg maker that ever gets released ever, yeah its fun to work with when you're not planning on being a ""Serious full-time developer"" Because lets face it, this can't create a rogue legacy or nuclear throne or super meat boy, this creates to the moon, lisa and similar stuff which are great games YES but are story dependent since the gameplay is really like every other rpg maker game ever.

And if you'd want to become a game developer and want to make a game with this software the buyers would be 95% rpg maker fans, and 5% of those that figured "" lets try it looks interesting"" 

And you can't please them by using the default assets and truthfully they look horrible, want to make a game using all default assets ? Thats your choice just don't put it up on steam because then you're just giving the software a bad name.

I know I am just ranting here, but seriously this software is for beginners, if you know you're on the intermediate or advanced levels don't use it, no matter how much rpg maker fans say ""This software is unlimited"" Trust me it is limited as hell, there's only so much you can accomplish, I know what I'm talking about Iv been using it and rpg maker vx ace for a long time don't let my small steam play time fool you, iv been on the forums and saw all sorts of games that I liked and really disliked, but after all they were the same idea, once  you see the game you just know ""oh this was made with rpg maker "" Why is that ? Because it is in-fact limited, so lets stop bullsh*ting and say it isn't.

Only use this if  you want to make a game with no significant gameplay or graphics but a great story, otherwise switch the engine.


I Can already see people downvotting the crap out of this review.


Updating this just to add that after testing out for a long time

Even when the ability to port your game to android/ios that everyone was so hyped about 
When I kept doing my projects and converting them to android you wouldn't believe the amount of bug and glitches that still exists "" This is written in august/9th/2016 ""  

So many slow down issues, events goes in different times, videos not playing properly, game keeps freezing and/or endlessly presses the menu button 

So again they didn't provide a good fix and relying on the community to do it for them in plugins and there's certainly a good deal of those to fix some of the issues but keyword here is ""Some"" not ""all"" 

lets say you made a good game, then decided to port it to android, prepare to spend a really ...really long and painful work just to make it optimized ...otherwise prepare to have so many negative feedback from people with different mobile phones than the one you tested it on ..."

RPG maker MV is the latest version in the RPG maker series and also a game changer in the series for the first time that it now have web, mobile/console support and mac support.
As it now using javascript as a advance user coding platform this make it more versatile unlike it predecessor.

												An easy to use game maker engine that builds off the foundation set by its predecessors. I say 'game maker' rather than RPG maker because it has the potential to create other genres such as action, adventure and visual novel games, just like  the previous engines.

Its simple and familiar look makes it easily accessible to people who have already used any of the previous engines, and is approachable to people new to it as well. It contains more features than any of the previous engines. JavaScript looks formidable compared to Ruby, but everything can be learned in time. The character generator has much better parts than the Ace one, and even provides a base and parts for their sideview battles.

Despite the familiar appearance, it has been remade completely, so bugs are expected from something so new. I've only encountered graphical bugs so far, but none of the lag mentioned (using a 4 year old i5 laptop with a generic graphics card that has update-to-date drivers). Just need to point out that practically every single program and game out there has bugs on release. The important thing is that the reported issues are being fixed, the developers just need time.

Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, and glad to have it despite the bugs. Kudos to the Degica team who worked so hard to see this program released this early, and who are still dealing with the issues related to the program together with Kadokawa."

Reviews(my anger may affect the reviews):

Pros:
-Things are easier with JavaScript.
-You can encrypt your game's file (datas like pictures)
-Easily port to other platform(with built-in manual).
-Resolutions are better than the last version. You can freely change the size of the window.
-Built-In Character generator (for newbies)

Cons:
-It's like the XP,VX ACE Combined and Remastered
-No changes in the events' menu at all
-Everything is pretty much the same without community-made Plugins(for example : Yanfly Stuffs changes the way RPGMAKER Games look like)
-THE PRICE?! NO Why? 50% off the day right after I bought for the FULL PRICE. Are you kidding me? heh

Conclusion:
Everyone can use this engine easily. You can make everything ,with the plugin. The changes of the script is really big. Few people knows Ruby but now It's JavaScript which is easier and wider. Easy Interface.
PreMade Maps,Tilesets are good.
,So
.
.

 I DON'T Recommend this product UNLESS It's on SALE(Just Kidding) 
The Product: 8/10(As I said above,It's like the XP,VX ACE Combined and Remastered) 
Worth It?: 6/10(Too expensive for kiddos)(If I take my anger on this It would be -10/10)


13/10 Would buy product 1 day before the sale again"

												If you've used RPG Maker in the past, this will be very straightforward for you. I'm sure there is a learning curve, but I've been using the RM series since RM95 so I'm probably not someone who can comment on the newbie aspect.

This is pretty much the step forward I have been waiting for. The Javascript is far more functional than ruby ever was. The game now supports just about any resolution you want, wide screen, mobile/html5 porting, mouse/keyboard/gamepad custom controls; functionality wise there isn't much more that I could want.

The asset pack leaves room to be desired, but it is what it is. If you're a serious designer, you likely won't be using those assets anyhow. You can definitely make a game without needing more stuff, I'd just prefer a larger variety of character maker customizations. 

I'm going to keep chipping away at my game; if I run into any strange problems I'll be sure to update this review."

												Really good for making fairly simple top-down RPG's. You may need to keep a browser tab open on YouTube if it's your first time, but it is actually pretty simple. Plenty of base stuff (buildings, characters, misc etc) and some in-app customization. Overall, very good.

Only negative so far is the price. Very steep for something like this."

												RPG Maker MV is a very powerful engine that lets you create every kind of game, so not only an RPG.
RPG Maker MV is also an awesome upgrade from RPG Maker VX Ace. In fact, there are a lot of new features, such as the HD resolution, a bigger database, etc. It can exports games for Android, iOS, HTML 5, and more!!!
PROS:
+ HD resolution
+ Super user-friendly
+ Javascript!!!
+ No more hidden classes
+ Bigger database
+ Sideview battle system integrated 
+ Tons of new plugins
+ It exports games for Android, iOS, HTML 5, and more!!!
CONS:
- A bit of lag when mapping
- The integrated mapshot feature doesn't export a 1:1 map"

												""Mom look! I made a game!""

In all seriousness, RPG Maker MV is a pretty solid game-making tool. RPG Maker games have been given a bad reputation for being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fangames, and most of them are... But then someone comes out of no where with something real neato. 

But I suppose I should talk about the actual program, right?

As the name implies, you make RPG's. You can only make RPG's, because it's RPG Maker. It comes with a whole bunch of default music, tilesets, enemy sprites, and even a character generator. All are free for commercial use. You can obviously import custom graphics and music if you're an artist or musician. I'm not, so I just upload ♥♥♥♥♥ that I made in MS Paint.

10/10 would make RPG's again.

If you don't want to fall under the stereotype of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fangame RPG, then I would recommend importing custom stuff. I would also recommend the use of Plugins. Yes, Plugins. If you know javascript, you can write and import any kind of plugin to spice up your game a bit. Or if you have no idea how to do a javascript, you can just take some plugins off of the forums, provided that they're free to use. I highly recommend using plugins by Yanfly, because they make some real neato plugins that are real neato, and free for commercial use. These can be anything from easier menu management, or completely changing the battle system. 

RPG Maker requires no actual programming. Did I mention that? RPG Maker uses something similar to Scratch. It's hard to describe, so I won't. Look at the screenshots or some ♥♥♥♥ idk.

RPG Maker MV can export to Windows, Mac, iPhone or Android. The hard part about exporting to iPhone is getting that sonofa♥♥♥♥♥ onto the appstore, because ♥♥♥♥ Apple. You can charge a price, or put it out for free. Just make sure the stuff you use is free for commercial use if you decide to sell your ♥♥♥♥ game.

RPG Maker MV is some good ♥♥♥♥. Ever since I got RPG Maker, I've gotten so many ladies that I'm practically drowning. Now you can trick people into thinking you're a game designer but in reality you make ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sonic fan-RPG's. 

10/10 would make meme games again."

												I've been watching RPG Maker grow up since RM2K and it's definitely come a long way.  Let me tell you what RPG Maker is. It is an exceedingly awesome tool for making 2D JRPG style games. If you want to make your own Skyrim, this isn't the engine you're looking for...but people have created all kinds of amazing things with RPG Maker, diablo/baldur-like games, puzzle games, hidden object/visual novel, shoot-em-ups, arcade games, platformers and more.  For people who can think outside the box and don't limit themselves to the default artwork the possibilities are nearly endless. RPG Maker games with artwork reminiscent of MS Paint have achieved massive popularity and even commercial success. Lisa is just one example of many.

With MV moving from Ruby based scripting to Javascript, it opens up a whole new realm of possibilities. That said, ""Simple enough for a child"" may be a tad bit of hype. Your 3 year old? No. But a bright inquisitive 8 year old with a little help and encouragement? Definitely.

The RPGMakerWeb forums have a massive wealth of knowledge and if you're new to RPG Maker check out Kelsper's Beginner's Guide to RPG Maker VX Ace. There have been some changes but most of it still applies. This guide will answer most newcomers' questions and give you a solid base to work from.
http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?/topic/1249-beginnergeneral-beginners-guide-to-rpg-maker-vx-ace/

One of the biggest selling points is the added export capabilities to mobile platforms as well as PC and Mac with no additional cost like many game engines have. MV still has some bugs to iron out of course and if you don't need those additional options and already have a previous version of RPG Maker, then maybe stick with that and wait for a sale, but I wouldn't expect one until the later half or end of 2016.

Do people make bad RPG Maker games? God, yes. On an industrial scale. More than you could play in a lifetime. It's not RPG Maker's fault. But, people also make a lot of really awesome games. And some games that you can't even tell were made with RPG Maker. And some of those ""bad games"" are actually some of the most popular!

What is RPG Maker? ""A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there...is a choice I leave to you."" -Neo (that guy from Point Break that couldn't shoot Patrick Swayze)"

												I wholeheartedly recommend RPG Maker MV as a starter software for anyone who is interested in making a game.
I see a lot of people recommend Unity or Unreal Engine as ""easy"" tools for beginners, but both of those require a decent coding knowledge of some sort (well, Unreal Engine 4 not so much). On top of that, you will need to make your own assets for the game to be high-quality, unless you want to purchase an asset pack off someone else.

RPG Maker requires zero coding experience, only patience and understanding. The eventing system, while it takes a bit of time to fully figure out (e.g. self switches and ""delete event"" commands reset after you change map), is very simple to use, yet allows for (functionally) limitless possibilities.

Improvements over VX Ace, the previous iteration of the software, include:
-Changing the nightmare-inducing front portrait character generator to a side portrait one, allowing you to create much more aesthetically pleasing character portraits. 
-Native sideview battle mode, no longer requiring custom scripting.
-Significantly improved OST, with much improved themes for everything.
-Javascript instead of Ruby (kind of a big deal, as plugins are now able to do a lot more).
-Export to pretty much anything (Browser, Android, iOS, Windows, etc.) whereas VX Ace only supported Windows (I think).
-Modern tilesets/assets provided with the base game - no more reliance on custom content for a modern-themed RPG.
-Various QoL improvements (showing you where the dialog window cuts off when editing, so you don't accidentally have your text not showing properly in-game because you forgot to hit enter).
-Native touch/mouse control support.

If you can't afford it at base price, as it is pretty expensive, you can wait for a sale.

This is a brilliant tool for anyone interested in game design, beginner or otherwise. I might go as far as to say it is the tool to start with for those who are interested in game development but have little to zero coding knowledge.

Definitely recommended."

												It is nice, but I would feel better about the purchase if it had come with more tilesets and generator assets. It would also be nice if it was easier to add new resources. At the moment you have to re-number/name them by hand and make sure they go into the correct places yourself. It's not overly difficult, it just gets irritating when you are adding multiple resources. The program itself is easy to use and understand. My only real complaint is as stated above. I would like more RTP resources included and an easier/faster way to add your own resources. Overall it's decent, but their is certainly room for improvement. The only reason I'm giving this a thumbs up is because the community they have built on the rpgmaker forums is super helpful and supportive. It really makes this program shine over it's competitors."

												I want to say that this really is an amazing game maker it actually has a lot of versatility, and I am very impressed. 

A couple things I want to say for people reading this: 

If you are the kind of person who starts something and doesn't finish it you probably won't like it.

If you are the kind of person who needs instant gratification, and need there to be action right then you probably won't like it either

For those of you who have no experience in game making like me, you can still make a pretty good game with just a little practice, and there are plenty of guides out there so don't let that stop you. For those of you who have experience game making that helps too.

I also want to say that if you want to make your own graphics for your game though and not use other people's you need to be able to use photoshop well, but I am content to use other people's (There are a lot of people who make graphics for it online)

Overall I highly recommend it."

												I personally do like RPG Maker MV. It has a lot of options, a supportive community, and so much more. My only gripe is that it doesn't run on Linux. In fact, the latest RPG Maker that's for Linux via Steam is RPG Maker VX, which is two steps behind this software. Sigh.

Either way, it's good when you can use it."

												Given my time that is continuously invested in RPG Maker MV, I felt that it would be fitting to weigh in my opinions on the software.

One could essentially say that RPG Maker MV is an enchanced overhaul on what was VX Ace. While that would be over-simplifying things, I would agree for the most part. Granted, not everything makes a perfect transition and there are a few oddities here and there with MV. On the whole, though? This was worth *every* penny to me, just as VX Ace was. Note that while I love MV, I am not at all saying that VX and VX Ace are ""obsolete"". People are still making games with them, after all. 

One of the first things you might notice (particularly if you are another ol' VX Ace user like me) is that games are graphically improved upon and a bit more defined. But this is only the surface of what MV has to offer. In many ways, customization has never been easier. There are many nifty convenient shortcuts added in to help with those ""repetitive database moments"" when making large games in past versions. Then there is also the option of having a Side View Battle system (along with the standard Front View that most of us know all too well). While there are a few ""little things"" that I wish I could tweak with ease, these are nitpicks. If you can think of a feature you dream up for a game, it's highly probable that you can see it manifest with MV (or find/create plugins that assist in that regard). 

You don't really *need* programming knowledge (although it definitely doesn't hurt to have it). What users ""need"" is a general idea or theory of how games work ""behind the scenes"", so-to-speak. Even if you don't really have that, learning it is relatively simple with time and experimentation put into projects and experiments. I can't tell you how many times I've been on a given idea for a feature only to dream up other ideas and play around with the software's tools just to see if it could work. So even with virtually little to no programming experience and with just ""RPG Maker experience"" (like myself), users can really do quite a bit with this. Also, as others here say, plugins can definitely be a way of taking your creations to the next level.

My only (constructive) criticism of MV? I know it's something that they are working on even now, but I feel that game deployment & data usage could use a bit more improvement in some areas. However... while there is the occasional derp, it is worth mentioning that deploying is not the buggy nightmare it once was. So, that's a huge improvement in my book. Given that I've been playing with this since its release (and given how far its come along), I must say I'm fairly optimistic about its growth through recent and future updates. If you've got the imagination, plenty of hours to kill and that itch to make a game under your own vision... I would honestly recommend RPG Maker MV. 

Edit: I've been asked a few times on my thoughts on MV's Season Pass and other resources for purchase on Steam. I do not have Season Pass, but I would recommend RPG Maker MV by itself first (to see if you like it) before deciding on purchasing a bunch of additional resources."

												I have been playing with this program for a bit now. I have fun just creating areas in it. Scripting is fun in it as well. Its a lot more fun to work with than I had originally thought. I might even finish this project and put it on steam. I am no expert at it but I am having a blast playing around with it. This is the perfect software for people who like to write stories. It gives the reader the chance to act the story out and watch it come to life. Compared to the other game making programs I use, this one is probably the easiest to make an actual game with. There are a great many 3rd party plug ins for this software but remember, every time you add one it makes your creation a bit more laggy, even on a high end system. This software is not about making the best looking game, graphics wise, but it is very good at making a highly interactive game that is heavily story based. There are many ways to add your own custom content into your creations but as usual it requires effort and time. Over all, I give it a thumbs up."

												RPG Maker MV is the latest in the series of development software by Enterbrain. But is it truely the next step up from RPG Maker VX Ace? Or will it be just...meh. Let's find out!


POSITIVES:
RPG Maker MV allows you to make games for Mac OSX, HTML5, and Android/iOS devices, increasing the amount of systems you can get your game onto. The resolution is upped from 544x416 to 816x624. Mouse and touch controls are added. Map layering for better map making. Javascript for easier script production and a wildly increased database maximum at 2000. Side view battles can be done without adding scripts. There's also multiple tilesets for modern and medivel/fantasy stuff.

NEGATIVES:
Let's start with default pre-made stuff: RPG Maker VX Ace gives you hundreds of attacks and spells, a variety of items, a numerous cast of actors and what does MV give you? Like six attacks, four actors, five items, and four weapons and armor, as well as four enemies with gradually increasing HP and 30 of every stat with no EXP and Gold handouts. MV expects you to make EVERYTHING by yourself, slowing down the development process, it just gives you the bare bones stuff and nothing else. You still have to optimize the troop sets for side view battles yourself. The lack of a RTP ensures that your games have an extra 400MB of fat to it (Gamejolt gives you a limit of 1000MB for your games, meaning you have 600MB left for everything else if use that site for distribution). You now have to convert your music files in two different formats AND you can't import assets via the engine, you have to get into the folder yourself and put them in there by yourself (seeing a pattern here?). Making maps is bulky due to the increase of resolution (luckily your given a magnifer to make the map look smaller, but the thing expects your to find out manually).

CONCLUSION:
I can only recommend this to hardcore RPG Maker users who pretty much delete all the defaults and start from scratch and then only to go the extra mile or two. But for more casual use and for those who make games quickly (like myself) will find that RPG Maker MV works almost against them by artifically increasing the time needed to make a game, so no.
I got this as birthday present so I can't complain too much and its problems outweigh the good by just a nanogram. Plus the engine expects too much out of you.

Degica and Kadokawa to bring us this experience. I am not talking only for RPGMMV. When i start with RPGM2K3, from nothing i feel as a master of making games. MV was something i was waiting a long time. Thanks to Archeia too. Because i feel that never will come and she make me believe and wait before move to another Engine. And as always is a experience of knowledge and hard work. I wish to have more time. You always want to do more and more. Thanks to the team that make this possible. And now multilenguaje. :)"

												 Please read my ENTIRE review before setting this review as positive or negative.

This is a very early review considering I haven't fully delved into the application 100%. However, from what I seen of this software and it's capabilities thus far.... Anyone can make a great game from this if they meet a set criteria. But it will take a lot of time and patience. Not just one or two or ten hours. This will take HOUNDREDS of hours. 500+ hours for anything even remotely decent and that still wouldn't even conclude as a finished product.  

The only draw back I have with it, the developers seem to be money grubbers. Too expensive. A lot of DLCs I seen should have came with the base installation of the application or been made free. The application is already very expensive. But that can be overlooked considering what it is capable of. There isn't much content that comes with the application. None the less, you should make your own sprites anyway.  

But.... It would have been a HUGE plus to have more content with the purchase.  However, what it lacks with content it makes up for with a HUGE amount of public/private users that give their creations free to the public as open source. Also, if you DO make a decent game. You could end up making back the money you spent on it originally plus more. There is also a huge amount of support out there among the other users of this product. 

I DO recommend purchasing this application ONLY if you have the time and skills it takes to design a decent game. Since it lacks base content, if you can't actually create your own texture atlases/sprite sheets, your game may well look the same as any other. So, I do NOT recommend it to someone who can't make their own sprites unless you have a friend or team willing to work with you that can make the sprites you need... 

Or, if you think you can use what it comes with and still keep it original. I also recommend this as a learning edge/curve tool for those who would like to learn more about game design and pixel art. If you are an amateur or new to it all together. This tool can be a HUGE incentive to learn.

My review is an opinion. The following are also opinions. I will start with the negatives and then go to the positives.

Negatives :
1. The developers seem to be extremely greedy. Many of the DLCs should have been free to begin with or already come with this application since it already lacks content. I don't agree with the pricing of this application.

2. Lacks basic content. This can be overlooked. You should be making your own content anyway.

3. No start up tutorials. This also can be overlooked since there are many tutorials all over the web.

4. Time consumption. <=== There is no dodging this one. No matter what, it will take time. This application actually cuts the time it would take you to make a game from scratch by 5/25th. Might not seem like a lot, but I made games in the past and it took me a WHOLE YEAR to make one game run on MS-DOS bug free and be available for public purchase..... Trust me, this application DOES cut your time frame greatly. Even though I put this as a negative. It really isn't.

Positives.
1. Starting from scratch vs Using this application. <===== As with the last negative. Using this application will shed much time off of your very very very very time consuming new hobby with making a game. As I stated before, I have made games in the past. From complete scratch to using Unity. This software WILL make EVERYTHING easier for you to make an epic RPG game with.

2. 2.5D <==== Not sure why no one mentioned this. While, RPG MV mainly uses sprites. You CAN actually use your own 3D models now because they allow higher resolution. How? You animate your models in an application like blender, and rip out each frame and turn it into a sprite. That easy. You can optimize all your visuals. I used to do this with Mugen. Just get blender which is free. Design your 3D model, rig it, texture it, etc. And then make the animations you want for use in RPG Maker MV. Now, you will have to resize your sprites. Since RPG Maker MV allows higher resolution, you can keep a great amount of detail in your images. Also, on a side note. Rip only one frame per three frames of your animation unless you need those extra animations. If you have photoshop, there is a free plugin you can use to put all your images into a texture atlas-sprite sheet and that plug in is free. You can do the same with Gimp and that also, is free.

3. Higher resolution. <=== Of all the previous RPG Makers I used, this one is technically worth that huge junk of change. I think 80 USD is a bit nuts. 50 USD I believe is an accurate price range. But I digress. Since now, you can use higher resolution sprites, you can make your games be able to compete with current gen of mobile app games and the like.

4. Cross Platform. <==== Do I really need to say more?!?!?! You can create your game for MANY different platforms now! INCLUDING MAC! For the longest time, RPG Maker was not compatible with mac. NOW IT IS! :)  This, in my opinion. Is a HUGE HUGE HUGE bonus.

5. User Base. <==== This is another huge bonus. Never have I seen a more open and kind user base for any application in my life. If you don't believe me, google Yanfly. That guy has been CONSTANTLY making more and more plugins FREE for all to use! Seriously! His site has MANY MANY videos including his youtube account. Tutorials and more. And he is just one individual. I spent a WHOLE DAY just going through his site. The vast amount of plugins he made for RPG Maker MV alone, turns it into a super super RPG Maker. There are MANY MANY other content creators for RPG Maker MV that give their work out as open source. Just look around.  =)

6. Teaching tool. <===== This application will help teach you java script and much more without directly doing so. Only because, they are need to know assets for this application. You can be completely new/ignorant to Java script. But by using this application and obtaining new assets for it from other RPG Maker MV users and going through the many tutorials. In no time you will begin to learn Java script. (""Java script is not java""). But that is just one example. There are many pixel artists out there as well who have tutorials. When reading their tutorials and then trying the same for yourself, you will notice over time you will gain more and more knowledge. And before you know it, you will be a pro.

7. More freedom. <=== previous RPG makers had their many many limits. But thanks to individuals like yanfly and the rest of the RPG Maker MV community, this application now is almost limitless in what you can accomplish for your game. Main limits will be (""Size"") of the sprites. Other than that though, very few limits. The community is constantly making new plug-ins to remove what previous limits it had.

8. The love. <==== For some reason, this application makes some people very kind and lovey dubby. (""Possible side affect/effect"") Just watch the youtube tutorial videos and you will see. Why did I mark this as a positive? Well, the nicer the people, the more willing they are to help you when you have a question or an issue.

And with that, ending my review. If you took your time to read this entire review, I thank you. ^^"

Think about it this way... If you are just starting out, it is easy to make a game that is ""too big."" It becomes easy for your game's design to become abstracted and for you to lose focus, particularly if you are not experienced. A lot of people just hit a wall with this kind of stuff, become overwhelmed and give up. And that's even without the whole rule of the last 10% of a project always being the hardest part to complete...

RPG Maker gets a bad rep in the professional games community but it's because people keep trying to sell games that are substandard, with a lot of the default assets, and beginner game design mistakes... 

 The fact is, this is a fairly robust system should you desire to make a turn-based, old school JRPG. I would totally recommend it to the right person.

 Basically, I have used this engine at game jams, and to make a gift for my fiance, and it gave me the focus I needed to pump funny JRPGs out very quickly. I could have used Unity or Unreal but then we are talking months of work instead of days.

 If you're really experienced and not interested in JRPGs there are tons of great free engines out there for you. But if you DO like JRPGs and want to  make them, you should check this out."

												Are you sad SquareEnix doesn't make RPG's anymore? Upset because you will never see another Chrono Trigger or Chrono Cross game? Have you ever wanted to make endless Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest clones? Do you enjoy gimmicky games like Undertale? Tired of having to download shady emulator programs from the spooky internet?

If you said yes to any of the above - steal your moms credit card (I know you're still in her basement) and purchase this immediately. I'm 1700 hours into this program and I have never had to leave my mother's basement once.  

UPCOMING GAMES I'M MAKING:
LAST ILLUSION III (Final Fantasy Clone)
LAST ILLUSION IV (Final Fantasy Clone)
WYVERN JOURNEY 1 (Dragon Quest Clone)
WYVERN JOURNEY 2 (Dragon Quest Clone)
WYVERN JOURNEY 3 (Dragon Quest Clone)
TIME CAUSE (Chrono Trigger Clone)
TIME BRIDGE (Chrono Cross Clone)
LOWERSTORY (Undertale Clone, with less gimmicks)

EDIT: I will put links to the games when they are finished!"

												Ok, looking my hours on this...

I think I've been a little bit crazy without finishing a single game.


Is this good.

YES.

RPGMaker always has some good resources.

Tileset? Checked.

Overwold characters? Checked.

Music? Sound effect? Commonly used assets?

All checked.

Besides those good things above, MV massivly improved its script system

And OH MY GOD it's cross platform.

The problem for me is the image assets feel too ""blocky.""

2000 and 2003 don't have this problem. They're like wine - old and neat.

But this is just a minor complain.


If you're concern about its price, you could try some free game engine.

Or maybe play some games made by this.

Don't like it, don't buy it.

If you like it, put some time into it.

I believe you would love it."

												I want to write an actual constructive review , but some people have already exposed the good and bad points in the review section . So , to make short :

Cons : 
_No RTP anymore , every new project will take the whole 400Mb to make , even for a little test thing
_Including outside content now requires to be done manually , while it could be done with a simple button inside the program in previous versions
_Same goes for script editing , the tool isn't here and you have to includes external scripts
_[NOTICED AND BEING FIXED BY DEVS] Changing the variable of status alterations makes the program crash . Devs are aware and fixing it .
(_I've also heard that converting games for android and all wasn't as easy as it was sadi

Now for the pros :
_Graphically fine , new Science-Fiction tilesets , graph and all are also a nice new elements , allowing to make decent utopian worlds 
_a GOOD character/face editor , with decent features unlike the horrible things that were predominant in VX Ace's one , also allowing you to put several characters in a simple sheet and to save samples
_Included 2d combat system (you could do that with scripts in VX for exemple , but I remember it used to crash sometimes , in here it's stable)
_Keeps all the usual features from other RPG makers , minus the ones described in the cons .
_Bigger default resolution for games , more detailed default sprites !
_That's a personal thinking , but the default musics included are better than before . (VX ones were good but VX Ace's were honestly ... idk , not as good ?)



It all depends what you're looking for . Saying it is easier than ever to make games sounds a bit like a lie considering how some of the options were removed , but all in all you still can do them by yourself , the base ressources are good , the char generator is very good and the side battle brings a refreshing change . Personally , I'm satisfied with my order !"

												Should've been label early access.

The switch to javascript has given more power to creators but at the cost of performance.  Animated tiles flat out cause framerate drops in game.  Editor also exhibits this lagging behaviour when pasting tiles.  Output to any format is completely open for end users, so it isn't really compiled as such and instead opens up for complete/partial copies of any better games as soon as they are released.


On the plus side maps can be any size (with a script), resolution can be increased (with a script), in fact everything can be changed with javascript.

While it could be good it clearly isn't at the moment and should be treated as the early beta it really is."

Well then it time to review this software anyways...

RPG maker MV is the latest version in the RPG maker series and also a game changer in the series for the first time that it now have web, mobile/console support and mac support.
As it now using javascript as a advance user coding platform this make it more versatile unlike it predecessor.

If you like to developed games as a hobby or to sell your game you should try MV."

												DON'T BUY IT YET - DOESN'T FUNCTION AS ADVERTISED

Reasons:

 Lacks explicit HTML5-exporter. The advertising says that you can export to HTML5, but there's no explicit option to do so.
 Windows builds use node-webkit as a wrapper, but don't package/archive the resources like other HTML5 game design toolkits do. Instead it just leaves the assets out in the open. 
 Android-exporter just exports a HTML-file (with resources) - it doesn't actually package an APK. Other HTML5 toolkits take care of this for you, but RPG Maker MV doesn't.
 iOS-exporter just exports a HTML-file (with resources) - it doesn't actually package an IPA. Other HTML5 toolkits take care of this for you, but RPG Maker MV doesn't.
 No fullscreen - just maximizes window. Previous versions allowed you to boot the game in fullscreen by default, but this one doesn't. You have let the user know that they need to press F4.
 Windowed mode has letterbox. In other words, there are two black bars in windowed mode, instead of the window snapping to the game's viewport.
 Title screen has no quit option on Windows- and Mac builds. Users need to ALT+F4 in order to quit.
 Most of the assets are RMVX-defaults or based on RMVX-defaults.
Wait until they fix these issues.

EDIT: Clarified some of the points."

												WARNING. LONG REVIEW TL;DR AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION

So. You want to create a RPG and maybe even sell it? You're in the right place. 
First thing you want to know. It's not going to be easy. I mean, it's ""easy"" to learn and even easier if you have programming related knowledge but you still need creativity + to spend tons of hours investigating about the Maker and playing around with the Maker. So be prepared to take some basic programming courses (Or at least search what it's a flowchart and how they work).

Let's assume that by this point you know the basics of the Maker and you've might or not finished your first ""game"".
You've may noticed that the resources of this Maker (as awesome as they are) are... somewhat limited. Maybe you want to make your game more awesome or maybe you want more control of what you can do inside the Maker . Fear not young enthusiast, the Internet is here to save you.

With enough Google-fu you'll find resources (Generator Parts, Sprites, Tilesets, Music, Pictures, Plugins) that will make your game look and function better (Hail ol' mighty forums!) .

If your intention is to create a game for the fun of it or just to show it to your friends you'll find yourself looking at the ""Free for non commercial use"" or ""Free for non commercial use with credits"" lines in the resources. What does that mean? It means you can use those resources without the need of giving money or asking for them.
Now, the thing is...if you go for a Commercial Release (A.K.A Wanting to make $ with your game) you'll find youself searching for the ""Free for commercial use"" line if you don't want to spend a cent in resources or buying them if you really feel like your game would need those resources if that message is not there.

Alternatively, if you have the skills (And Will) to create your own and unique game (Using your own resources) you can do it + learning JavaScript will help you to code your own plugins if you don't like the current ones or it just happened that there's no plugin that does what you want to do.

TL;DR: LEARN, EXPERIMENT AND DO IT

Now, onto the final part of the review. Why you should buy this Maker? 

Pros:
+ JavaScript 
+ Export to Android, MAcOS, iOS and Web (HTML5)
+ Actual Character Generator that doesn't make Lovecraftian beings like VX Ace
+ Your game can now be in HD
+ Mouse support (You can move with clicks and stuff)
+ A better map editor (Now with 3 layers!)
+ Side-view Battle (Now you can see your character fight!)
+ Tons of plugins being made as you read this
+ Super friendly community (As long as you ACTUALLY took the time to read the basics, don't be THAT guy/girl)

Cons:
- Export to Android, MAcOS, iOS 
While the game provides you the instructions to do this it's not precisely click and export like that. It it kinda tedious to do all that, just a warning. 
*HTML5 isn't like that, you just literally drop your game in a host and you'll be able to play it.
- JavaScript?  (Wait, what? Didn't you just said that this was a good thing?)
It is a good thing. If you know JavaScript or this is your first Maker. But for others that've been using Ruby from previous Makers it isn't. There might be people that think this change was for good, there might be others that do not believe so. (I believe  this change was for good)
Note: This doesn't mean that you can't make an awesome game in previous Makers. Just that some scripts from previous Makers might not be available if the autor did not transform them into JavaScript
- Not enough Character Generator parts
*This might've been a problem when the Maker came out, but since that, tons of resources have been made in order to satisfy the mayority. Netherless the problem was there once.

Welp. That's it. It's up to you to decide if this Maker is the ideal for you. Have fun making games!"

												RPG Maker MV, is easily the very best of them all. There is plenty of negative reviews out there, and truth be told - even after reading a couple of them, I honestly do not know why they posted negatives. 

Anywyas, let's get to my own feelings about the program : 

I absolutely love it, pretty much everything has been improved on and moved into right direction. The changes for many aspects are pretty subtle, but quickly turn out to be a major time / stress savers.
That being said, among many and many pros of MV, absolutely the very best part are user-made plugins. You may ask, why would I give developers credits for user created content, and I'll respond with : It's the same as with the game supporting modding, and the one that does not. Sure you do not review mods when talking about the game, but you surely list modability as a (huge) plus. And in this case, they not only gave means to create plugins, they did all they could to find and contact very reliable and knowledgable people to work on them (eg. Yanfly whom already created 20 very helpful plugins)

The only thing you have to watch out for, before buying RPG maker MV is the fact it does require a bit better PC than the older versions did. The games created in the program are greatly optimised and working a lot better, but the RPG maker itself is visibly bigger strain on your PC. - But well, as long as you meet the requirements, you'll be fine.

I've been only working with MV for as few as 9 hours, but I haven't encoutered ANY bugs nor crashes to happen in this short time. I also have a feeling that I have already progressed further than in 70 hours spent in Vx Ace. 
Where the work didn't quite go like I wanted to before, now it's pretty much a pleasure, because everything is a LOT more user friendly. 

If you have been using older versions of the RPG maker, and are wondering wether to buy MV - Go for it. You will need to do some tinkering to get your old projects to work on the new system, because it uses different coding language, and different resolutions, but it's worth every second spent on converting.

IF you are completely new to RPG maker series... well you should probably see some review about the RPG maker itself before, but as long you feel you are motivated enough to create an actual game, you should definetely buy MV over other versions. And well, if you want to create 2D RPG games, I also claim RPG maker series being the very best, and cheapest of the programs you can use to create such games (at least counting these you can work efficently in)."

												RPG Maker MV is the next implement of the RPG Maker franchise, a series of tools that allows you to create a classic RPG game. How that game is going to be made will be entirely up to you, enabling you to create the game you always dreamed of making. Starting off RPG Maker MV is an expensive tool set starting off at $79.99 and certain packs/DLC that follow suit are anywhere from $5.00-$20.00, which is a pretty expensive hobby overall. Once these have been purchased you are given a decent amount of starting resources to make a game. The tool itself is relatively easy to start using, but getting into scripts and how certain events work demands more advanced and seasoned users. While creating the game, you are given so many options from adding actors (the characters of your game), creating equipment, adding bosses and monsters, to states that will affect the combat, everything is up to your creative insight. The character creation tool makes its return again, but this time it feels like a much smoother system, characters created not only look better, but the sprites they produce also look pretty good. The system of creating events and maps remained more or less the same with a few new features, but overall the tool feels great. While some RPG Maker veterans will cling to the old, some will move onto the new and utilize this software to create awesome new titles that will either be sold on STEAM or remain only playable by the author.

PROS:
Loads of new resources and features
Pretty good starting music
Character creator enhanced
Allows you to create your own game
Easy to start off

CONS:
EXPENSIVE
Some features require more advanced users
Requires some of your older resources to be enlarged or changed to match the new standards."

												RPG Maker MV is the latest in the series of development software by Enterbrain. But is it truely the next step up from RPG Maker VX Ace? Or will it be just...meh. Let's find out!


POSITIVES:
RPG Maker MV allows you to make games for Mac OSX, HTML5, and Android/iOS devices, increasing the amount of systems you can get your game onto. The resolution is upped from 544x416 to 816x624. Mouse and touch controls are added. Map layering for better map making. Javascript for easier script production and a wildly increased database maximum at 2000. Side view battles can be done without adding scripts. There's also multiple tilesets for modern and medivel/fantasy stuff.

NEGATIVES:
Let's start with default pre-made stuff: RPG Maker VX Ace gives you hundreds of attacks and spells, a variety of items, a numerous cast of actors and what does MV give you? Like six attacks, four actors, five items, and four weapons and armor, as well as four enemies with gradually increasing HP and 30 of every stat with no EXP and Gold handouts. MV expects you to make EVERYTHING by yourself, slowing down the development process, it just gives you the bare bones stuff and nothing else. You still have to optimize the troop sets for side view battles yourself. The lack of a RTP ensures that your games have an extra 400MB of fat to it (Gamejolt gives you a limit of 1000MB for your games, meaning you have 600MB left for everything else if use that site for distribution). You now have to convert your music files in two different formats AND you can't import assets via the engine, you have to get into the folder yourself and put them in there by yourself (seeing a pattern here?). Making maps is bulky due to the increase of resolution (luckily your given a magnifer to make the map look smaller, but the thing expects your to find out manually).

CONCLUSION:
I can only recommend this to hardcore RPG Maker users who pretty much delete all the defaults and start from scratch and then only to go the extra mile or two. But for more casual use and for those who make games quickly (like myself) will find that RPG Maker MV works almost against them by artifically increasing the time needed to make a game, so no.
I got this as birthday present so I can't complain too much and its problems outweigh the good by just a nanogram. Plus the engine expects too much out of you.

												Hot-Fix:

For those experiencing crashing or freezing when trying to change the parameters in the traits-window; there's a bug related to the software not being able to distinguish between the "","" and the ""."" properly which causes some sort of havok. 

You'll need to alter your computers ""idea"" of what the decimal symbol is like, and make it correspond with ""."" in RPG Maker MV since it thinks the decimal = ""."" and not the "","".

To do this, flip up your control panel and click ""Formats, Location, Keyboards and Languages"" or ""Administrative"". Choose ""Region and Language"" and ""Additional settings"". Then change the ""Decimal"" from "","" to ""."". 

After this gets fixed, you can revert back to normal to avoid any further problems with software designed for European computers/input methods."

												I shall clarify I am a person who's spent over 2,000 hours in VX Ace, I have a VX Ace game on Steam (Close Your Eyes), and for my projects, most, if not all, of the assets are created by myself and a partner, so some of the issues people have with RTP stuff not coming until a later date don't bother me. What RPG Maker MV has done though is make a number of changes to the RPG Maker program that I'm loving.

I've spent 40+ hours in MV at the time of writing and have been making a little community Halloween game on a stream. Some of the changes to MV are very appreciated both from a developer and a player viewpoint. At first it seems quite similar to VX Ace, and indeed those who've spent a lot of time with Ace will probably immediately feel right at home, but the layout has been made overall easier, with new shortcuts around the window to access things easily and quicker, and the documentation included with MV is easy to find and more helpful and detailed than previous entries, in my opinion.

The first thing about anyone using the program compared to previous versions may notice, or anyone who's played RPG Maker games in general may notice, is that the default tiles and window resolution are much larger than previous entries (for a VX Ace comparison, VX Ace used 32x32 tiles, and the default window was 544x416, with the maximum resolution it could obtain being 640x480. Meanwhile, MV by default has 48x48 tiles and the tile sizes can be changed through scripting to any size you want really, and with a default resolution of 816x624, but can easily make HD resolutions and even reach 4k resolutions with some plug-ins if you really wanted to, though you'd need to design maps with that in mind ). And something I deeply appreciate on the user-side is now RPG Maker MV games can be resized manually; clicking the sides of the screen of an MV game will allow you to re-size the window, scaling the game to the window while also not ruining aspect ratio. Helpful for those in the past who hated the unchangably small window of past RPG Makers with only fullscreen as a usual alternative; now windows can be made any size manually.

Mapping is the next big thing people may notice a difference in compared to VX Ace. While Ace eliminated some of VX's mapping restrictions, MV basically abolishes VX Ace's restrictions in turn. You can now easily tile things from the B/C/D/E/etc tilesets over each other while mapping, and can via plug-ins make infinite layers and far higher sheets per tileset if you desire. And also as a result of the tiles being bigger, mapping also has gained an edge in ease, in my opinion.

To get this point out of the way: Plug-Ins. They're replacement to scripts in MV which use Javascript as opposed to Ruby (which the past iteration used), while MV needs time in the oven to have more publicly available plug-ins for the masses, how they are implemented are a lot better than scripting was, in my opinion. The restrictions on the engine being removed does aid this for more versatility, and the overall easier and more common language of Javascript is already doing wonders of accessible plug-ins and coding. There's definite promise this element will only grow with time and with people sharing their output. Being able to call, turn on and off, and easily modify Plug-Ins, as well as implement them into MV easier than scripts were to VX Ace, all help ease of use.

Speaking of ease of use, the ability to edit your game while play-testing is a huge time saver and helps the play-testing process immensely, as does being able to trigger and change variables, switches, and nodes easily while play-testing through the press of a button (press F8 while play-testing to access the developer console, F9 to access a menu to turn switches on/off).

Some misc notes on MV: The mouse/touch controls for MV are well-implemented and I've found myself using them while play-testing. Some small things, like events finally being able to easily walk over other events, are very much appreciated details. The audio system the game uses sounds a lot crisper to me than previous iterations, and the fade-out/pitch/other audio effects sound different compared to how VX Ace handled them, but I think they're an improvement. Also for some reason, the included RTP music in MV is really good, like leagues above previous iterations. There's a lot more music than usual, and they have much better production quality, and a lot of it is pretty catchy, actually. The plug-in to let users configure mouse/gamepad controls with full implementation is a godsend. On the RTP, it's also nice to no longer need to include it in exported files and raise game file sizes by a few hundred MBs.

And a huge draw for me behind the engine as well is it being easy to make a version for Mac computers, having friends and people asking for my previous games on Mac, this is appreciated. There's also HTML5 and Mobile support, but as of the time of writing they currently need a bit more work to get going, but not advanced knowledge to accomplish and the documentation on how is done well.

The multiple platforms, Javascript coding/Plug-Ins, and the resolution thing are probably the three biggest things for the engine, but a lot of the small touches to mapping/events/layering/audio and ease of use improvements have made this a very positive experience for myself thus far.

I've heard some have been having slow-down issues, if they can sort that out for people with the problem then we'll be perfect, and those who use the RTP will be happy when the full RTP collection is eventually released later, but I have to say this has been an improvement in a number of ways over VX Ace for me, and I plan to switch full on to this from Ace."

												Disclaimer: I received a beta key for free from the publisher. However, I swear that this hasn't affected my opinion on the product.  
 
RPG Maker MV is the next program in the long-running RPG Maker series. If you're familiar with the previous versions of the program, you will feel pretty much right at home with MV. On the surface, it functions much like VX Ace, and those who have used it should have no trouble at all getting around the functions of MV. But under the hood, there's a lot more going on, and I think for the most part, it's for the better. 
 
The biggest differences are the program's main selling points - the addition of side-view battles, the ability to export to a number of different platforms, including PC, Mac and phones, as well as the use of Javascript as the primary coding language of the software. This will no doubt make it easier than ever for people to not only make games with RPG Maker, but play them as well. 

There's a handful of other new features as well. Most things are just expansions on what VX Ace already did, like having more Region Tags and more options in the Show Choices Event, but then you have the totally new stuff, like the Event Searcher, the ability to change the amount of equipment slots that your characters have or change default system messages, without the need for additional scripts. 

But at the same time, I think that is one of the program's flaws. It feels too much like VX Ace. It DOES feel like a ""step up"", but it DOESN'T feel like an ""evolution"" of VX Ace, and I think that's what it really needed. You could say that we shouldn't fix what isn't broke, but I think that, despite all the new and exciting features it DOES provide, there are a number of things that I think would have made it all the more exciting and, especially due to the vocal public interest in such features, I'm surprised that they were not included. Sure, you can add a lot of things to the game via Plugins, but you could do the same thing in Ace. It really feels like there's just not enough ""new"" content in MV.
 
One thing I'm definitely happy with are the new default graphical and audio assets. VX Ace had a major problem where just about every project looked the same because the default graphics were so incredibly generic and the character generator was very poor. In some ways, the graphics still are generic, but I think they're much more vibrant looking, and more importantly, there's A LOT more variety, as far as the packed-in assets are concerned. This, I think, will make RPG Maker projects, even those made with only default assets, a lot less monotonous to play. 
 
As far as the character generator is concerned, it's a HUGE improvement. VX Ace's was, quite frankly, terrible, and this one is considerably better. The graphics look exactly like the default pre-generated assets, including the face graphic generator. This allows you to make characters that are consistent with the default assets, and hey, they actually don't look terrible this time. 
 
But there are other problems with MV. The maximum map size has been almost halved. Why? Apparently we can blame phones for that. They've also made it harder and more annoying to add Plugins and new resources to your project. There are no longer buttons in the editor to quickly bring up a resource manager or the page to add in Scripts. Instead, you must navigate to the game's folder on your computer and add everything manually. 

But the absolute biggest problem with MV, in my opinion, is that there is no longer a Run Time Package. The RTP was useful in previous RPG Maker games, because it allowed you to make games with a very small file size by not bundling the RTP with your project, so that other players would need to download the RTP themselves. This made it easy to upload projects to have friends test them, or to seek quick tech support on the forums, with the experts being able to see exactly what you were doing with your project, without them needing to download a large file. 

Well, that's gone. Now, every project you make will be around 400MB. Want to make a quick blank project to test something? That's 400MB more on your hard drive. Want to share your game with someone? You'll have to upload 400MB every time you make a new version of it. Oh sure, you can manually delete all of the assets that you're not using, but this can be a very time consuming process. I can only hope that this problem is addressed in the near future. 

But the big question is... should you buy RPG Maker MV? 
 
Well, I suppose that depends on a few factors. 
 
Do you have the money to burn? If so, definitely get it, because it's the next logical step up above VX Ace. It's an almost all-around improvement and I think that if you can afford it, and you're serious about designing something with the program, then it's definitelty worth your money. 
 
But if you can't really spare the cash, it's probably better to go with VX Ace for now. Ace is much cheaper and has a massive amount of user scripts available. Right now, MV has pretty much none, since it's brand new, but in the coming months, MV will most likely have a number of talented scripters working hard on creating new plugins for the software, and I think with the switch over to Javascript, there will be a lot more interesting and more complex scripts than ever before. This is all just speculation on my part, though. 
 
I think that the next several months will be important for MV, to see what sort of content is created through user scripts and perhaps official DLC. If it can drum up a lot of support, then it will succeed and will be without question the go-to program for making RPGs in an easy-to-use way. But if they can't iron out some of these problems and get more people making Plugins and Resources for the program, I could certainly see it failing. We'll just have to see what happens, won't we?

Overall, I would recommend RPG Maker MV. There's still some issues, but I have faith that they'll iron them out. If you want to wait a while to purchase, I wouldn't blame you, but if they can fix these problems then I will without a doubt recommend this program."

												In it's current state, maybe 7/10. But, I got it for 55% off, so it was worth it.

The good:

* It does what it says it does. Helps you make an RPG fast.
* Lots of assets, effects, and animations, etc.
* It runs on my Mac.

The bad:

* The scripting interface is OK. But, It reminds me of FileMaker. Easy things are easy, and hard things are just that much more difficult. 
* Plugins are all all over the place. Why does RPG Maker not include a browser for published plugins with the ability to install them? This is possible with the Steam workshop, but plugin authors don't seem to have any incentive to publish them there. 
* JavaScript, the language of the Internet, is used for scripting. But, there isn't any built in command to load remote resources. Why not?"

												Alright, here's the thing about this program. It's amazing. As an artist, I understand how much effort has to go into each tileset and character and musical score. It makes sense that it costs money to get things for it, and the amount it gives you with the base software is fantastic for what it is. Game development is hard. A lot of people will never finish their games when they buy this, or will make a little base-pack romp and wonder why it gets bad reviews, but that's not this software's fault. The resources are there to make something amazing with this. But it's a tool. It's like buying a workshop, which includes a simple birdhouse kit, and then cursing the tools for the fact that all you can build is the birdhouse. You gotta work for it. You have to buy more wood. You have to practice your sawcuts, you need to buy better paints and brushes so the colors can be cleaner and more vibrant. With that workshop, you can build anything, but if all you can see is that one birdhouse, it'll never be what you want it to be."

												If you are looking to jump into making anime style RPGs without too much hassle then this is a great program for you to use.  If you have some past coding experience with java then you can do wonders with this program in regards to making highly customized games that are unique to you.  RPG MAKER MV comes with lots of tile sets, character styles, and music that allow you to start making games right away.  

I am using this program to make personalized games for the grandkids Christmas 2016.

If you are looking to make platformer or top down shooters, or other types of games, then check out Construct 2."

												=Edit= [The newest version has come out but the points of this review still stand. The update has added things, fixed bugs and textures. Fixed autowalls and more. The review however focused on other problems that I have myself and therefor the review still stands as what it is.]

So my reviews normaly tend to be longer but since this is still updating, I will not go in with a big review.

So far it is very interesting to say the least. The Program is completly different to the ones before and yet stood similar sort of. Now before you are getting confused: The game overall is the same but does things completly different. The Layers are not just two anymore. Instead we have two layers with an artificial third one.

You can place the groundlayer and put something on the object layer. In VX and Ace you would have to use a event to put another object above it and in MV it simply does it without the event. Meaning that placing a Puppet and then a chair infront of it wont make the puppet disappear like before in the VX and Ace versions. This will make mapping much easier especially for the ones not used to use Parallax over normal mapping. (Placing another object above the two placed ones will make it disapear though.)

The next thing is Javascript over Ruby. Now while I like a sorting system I dont think the change to Javascript makes a big difference. It probably is a bit easier to learn since more commonly known but still. The plugin sorting system though is a nice addition and it means that you wont have to download the scripts over and over again. Simply copy the files and activate them.

The character generator is a thing that I am only OK with. Overall the quality is amazing but I really liked the old look of the VX and VXAce characters. Of course that doesnt mean that it has to stay like that forever but I feel like the characters are a bit out of place. Especially with the addition of the sort of Kaduki Battlesystem. Maybe its just that I am used to the old character sprites but that is how I think about it.

The Tilesets. The Tilesets are... They are... Lets just point it out: They are meh.
Overall its nice looking and good quality and the addition of having modern tiles is just as good but it just doesnt look as good anymore. Overall the quality of the tilesets is very good. But we didnt have new texture formats since XP and I thought that was the way to go. They were RPGs and should look simple. Now they look just more detailed than the ones we had before and that is it. I will have to live with it but that doesnt mean that I will keep quiet about it.

A new addition I do like a lot however is the zoom. It makes things much easier for mapping. I always wanted to zoom in further to see everything a bit better to go in with a few more details just for that little area but couldnt. I wanted to focus on that one area on the map but couldnt. Now I can so that is most certainly a good one.

The last thing I want to cover is the lack of Weapons, Monsters and Skills. This of course could be added in a future update but right now it isnt in so I will adress it. For me it was always hard to get into this RPG Maker thing. I didnt want to watch silly Tutorials, shouldve done it though, and went straight into the menu to find it out myself. Most of the stuff I know I actually taught myself by looking at the program so its actually easy to learn. But with MV we have one part of that where I say that the old programs did it better.
Weapons, Monsters and Skills. There are barely any right now and its kind of a problem. I mean you have your basic stuff which is good and we are able to use it but not more. Not knowing what kind of stuff can be used with this different program makes it even more complicated in that case and requires you to actually go and for a hit and miss.
I hope they will update the game on this part, which I am sure they will but still.

And thats about it so far. Program is decent and usable but for those that wonder if they should buy it, I would say: Wait for now. Keep your money and just wait. Updates are coming in and that means things are going to change. Not by a lot but atleast by a bit.

Thanks for reading"

												Summarily, my YES recommendation is ONLY if you're going to actually make a game - great. If you're just looking to get involved with programming and see this as a simple entry point at low cost - this isn't what you're actually looking for.  Many people purchase this and realize that it's not strictly drag and drop despite the WYSIWYG editor and that 85% of the time, you'll need to spend more money and or get at least a small team of people to complete a game (depending on the sieze and scope).  Though RPG Maker has what you need to make a game, it lacks enough of anything to make a substantive game and you'll either spend as much time or money making or buying assets as you would using a more diverse engine like Constructor 2 or Unity. 

*****************************************************************************************************

YOU WILL DO WELL TO BE AWARE much of the included content is not enough to make a game many people would play / buy. In fact, many of the included resources nad DLC suffer from a visual and quality inconsistency that they're not worth using beyond learning materials. So far, most of the season pass content is piecemeal and doesn't actually add to the core content either - it's so far been different art style avatars, a few music loops, and some sprites that inevitably become unused or overused by the userbase. 

*****************************************************************************************************

That said, if you're familiar with RPG Maker, MV comes with bittersweet changes. JavaScript replaces Ruby and the pixel diemnsions of sprites and tiles increased which means old assets cant be used without manual conversion.

I just can't figure out why the choice was to go with JS given RPG Maker touts itself as something for people to learn and build games quickly. IMO, Python would be a much better option under those pretenses.

There is a supportive community, but it's split. Some have been afraid to jump over to MV because it means they'll need to recreate all their assets but several communities exist exclusively for MV and have very friendly and helpful people. 

Pros (some of them a double-edged sword)

JavaScript is a popular frontend code used by many for mobile developent and is relatively approachable for new or non scripters. Still worse and less approachable than Python, by far.

Fairly easy to get started and produce something to play around in (not play, but get a good idea on how to be part of a team to work on something worthy).  

Several communities exist full of helpful people willing to impart wisdom regarding use and development. 

Resolution supportrs larger screens.



Cons:

Despite JavaScript being a positive, it's also a negative. It's complex in syntax and probably a bit jarring to those coming from Ruby. Personal opinion is that Python would've been a better direction as it's the least difficult, still widely used and well understood language, highly approachable, and many other external software programs could export assets to Python. 

The resources included have begun to fall behind - they're visually inconsistent between tilesets and themes while also lacking a full set of anything substantive. It's best to look at the included assts as placeholders and if you want to have anything worth making then plan on paying for additional assets in bits or create them entirely yourself. 

$80 isn't much for an ""engine"" and many engines cost more, but unlike other engines RMMV is geared toward a single genre and is severely underpowered compared to several other products on approach. It does it well, but with some of the other bugs and feature cconstraints it can make some customers wonder if the tag is high, all things considered. 

Publishing to mobile platforms uses older methods that aren't very efficient and sometimes ineffective. 

Fewer users have MV and use it than VX/VXA, This makes the available resources and support rather sparse at the moment.

Larger format means assets from previous iterations will have to be converted for use or can't be used at all, and then of course there's certain members of the community are overly protective of the product.... like dealing with Apple fanatics on Facebook."

												I'm really impressed by your work. RPG Maker MV is great and stuff. However, there is an issue in your new added function, that removes any unused files from project. I tried to use it and ALL the music from my game got removed. My custom game cursor got removed as well. All unused enemy images got deleted, sure, but that is the only thing done right. So please, fix this issue and make your program scan user's project throughly. Let it take more time, but at least we'll get what we need.

												I never really wrote a review in any rpg maker I own considering that I worked a lot on them but I felt like doing one on MV since it had some very disappointing features.

Do I recommend this software ? 

YES and NO 

Yes if you want to make a game on that genre, and found the software on a really cheap deal
NO if you want to create something different, or have good experience with programming and designing.

What you can find in MV that didn't exist in all the previous versions is javascript support.

It can ""Create"" Android, web, IOS, Windows games, HOWEVER You have to do ALL The work yourself on converting it to each platform and trust me its a lot of work, you'd have to download and install a lot of environments, then set their paths, then run a CMD with a long code that you get, then wait it to convert it, then test the ""APK android for example"" 
Then you open it in your mobile and turns out the resolution and texts are messed up so you have to do it again.

Even after doing all those steps you'll probably encounter an issue due to the SDK's updating and you'll spend hours trying to sort it out.

Another disappointment was the lack of workshop support.

Whats sad is that we finally have mobile support and the software does not support it by itself you do all the work, they did not even include a method to add buttons on the mobile screen or anything, they just simply made it sort of like ""Open source"" type so the community creates codes to do that, and most of the time those plugins you download online will conflict with other plugins and messes up the game so you'd have to delete them.

Then you'd have to find another way to add your customized features, and do it all over again.


OVERALL 

Get this software on a great cheap deal, and use it if you'd want to develop games that follows the genre of this software, otherwise just get game maker studio or anything else if you're already good at designing since that software does not really need any programming experience.

Honestly, after I am done with creating the game I am working on I will never touch this software again or any other rpg maker that ever gets released ever, yeah its fun to work with when you're not planning on being a ""Serious full-time developer"" Because lets face it, this can't create a rogue legacy or nuclear throne or super meat boy, this creates to the moon, lisa and similar stuff which are great games YES but are story dependent since the gameplay is really like every other rpg maker game ever.

And if you'd want to become a game developer and want to make a game with this software the buyers would be 95% rpg maker fans, and 5% of those that figured "" lets try it looks interesting"" 

And you can't please them by using the default assets and truthfully they look horrible, want to make a game using all default assets ? Thats your choice just don't put it up on steam because then you're just giving the software a bad name.

I know I am just ranting here, but seriously this software is for beginners, if you know you're on the intermediate or advanced levels don't use it, no matter how much rpg maker fans say ""This software is unlimited"" Trust me it is limited as hell, there's only so much you can accomplish, I know what I'm talking about Iv been using it and rpg maker vx ace for a long time don't let my small steam play time fool you, iv been on the forums and saw all sorts of games that I liked and really disliked, but after all they were the same idea, once  you see the game you just know ""oh this was made with rpg maker "" Why is that ? Because it is in-fact limited, so lets stop bullsh*ting and say it isn't.

Only use this if  you want to make a game with no significant gameplay or graphics but a great story, otherwise switch the engine.


I Can already see people downvotting the crap out of this review.


Updating this just to add that after testing out for a long time

Even when the ability to port your game to android/ios that everyone was so hyped about 
When I kept doing my projects and converting them to android you wouldn't believe the amount of bug and glitches that still exists "" This is written in august/9th/2016 ""  

So many slow down issues, events goes in different times, videos not playing properly, game keeps freezing and/or endlessly presses the menu button 

So again they didn't provide a good fix and relying on the community to do it for them in plugins and there's certainly a good deal of those to fix some of the issues but keyword here is ""Some"" not ""all"" 

lets say you made a good game, then decided to port it to android, prepare to spend a really ...really long and painful work just to make it optimized ...otherwise prepare to have so many negative feedback from people with different mobile phones than the one you tested it on ..."

												It's rpg maker, but you really can do some cool things with it. You can add plugins to improve the functionality of the systems that you would usually use. You can even make your own plugins if you'd like. The map editor is pretty solid in my opinion. It even takes care of the layering for you. The Character creator is okay to get started but there are other programs available to help create cool RPG maker MV styled characters if you feel there aren't enough options. Basically you get a bunch of assets to get you started so you can focus on getting other parts of your game made. That said I still recommend trying your hand at drawing your own tiles :) Overall, I highly recommend this program for people who want to make a solid RPG game."

												Firstly, let me say I put in a total of two hours into this. I've been focusing on character creation, creating classes, skills, items, weapons, all of the above! This software starts you bare bone, so you'll have alot of time being invested in your hands. The good part about it? It's as simple and basic as Ace.

Not sure where these bad reviews are coming from, but I'm assuming by those who want the gold platter place in front of them and expect no work or effort being done what so ever. Truth is, in game development, even something basic such as this, you'll never have that gold platter. You're either an artistic person or creating a video game isn't your style. Simple as that.

I can see myself involving this project i'm currently developing for nearly two years, depending how quick the DLC rolls in and how quick Yanfly operates those scripts. Good part is that this is run off Javascript, so that language won't be hard to translate due to knowing C#. Hopefully, I'm able to adjust a few things here and there.

There is one con though, and that's the lack of art introduced to the software. The detail on the monsters are really ugly, and it's a good thing I was able to transport all the art from ACE into this, and surprisingly, the art isn't oversize nor out of place. At first, the SV on my battlers side look extremely small, but I look back at games like FF4 that had the same problem. It's something easy to overcome. But I just hope MV will have better looking monsters than it does now, otherwise might as well stick with ACE art style for the mean time.

It's good software, and I hope it'll last for quite a while. Yes, it has some bugs and lag, but this software just came out. Nothing is 100% perfect off the bat. Play any game todays age. Just be grateful they can be updated over time, comparison to games back then that couldn't be updated. :)"

												I am really happy to have purchased this. This isn't the first time I've used RPG Maker, though it is the first time I have bought it for myself. Most of the time I used other people's copies to mess around and help with some story writing. Not that I have my own version, I am very pleased with the amount of options i have as for putting games together, and that's helpful since I am mostly a writer. Being able to create my own characters makes it easier for me to build my worlds and focus on my storytelling."

												From the first few hours of derping around with this game (as with every RPG maker prior) This has left quite an impact on me. Content wise is vastly better then Ace and VX, with quite an intresting Character generator that i want to tamper with a little, see if i can make a whole set of new sprite types. The plugin system takes a bit of getting use to but i see it as a great way to get deeper into coding and scripting when you feel ready for it, or experimenting with some amazing scripts to enhance that game. i may update this little reviewishy thing since i wanna get deeper into this but i would say if your mind is creative, go for it and make a game with this. tools are there, the drive is all you need now."

												I have been away from RPG Maker for a long time and not used to seriously since XP, I did however like the look of MV so much that I bought it and I can safely say I am not disappointed. This is without a doubt the best version of the engine to date, the increased tile size, resolution and ability to make battles side view by default really make the software shine. 

Will this convert people who don't like RPG maker? No, but if you had even a passing interest in the previous iterations this is without a doubt worth a purchase as making your own old school style jrpg has never been so much fun.

On the subject of the dlc, I never bought the pre order version so I paid for them separately and although I was petty happy with both packs I thought the cover art one to be much better value. The characters included are very unique and have that Final Fantasy magic meets sci-if vibe to them. The music included is also excellent."

												While some aspects may be a bit restrictive, this is some powerful software capable of saving a programmer a lot of time. I found the UI a bit counterintuitive at first, but it does get much easier to navigate once you become more familiar. I hadn't tried any previous releases of this software, so I can't speak to it's improvement over the last version."

												I've recieved this product as a gift- and I have to say, it's the one of the best things I've ever got.

This is a very early review considering I haven't fully delved into the application 100%. It will take a lot of time and patience. Not just one or two or ten hours. This will take houndrets of hours. But with enough practice and experience you'll get while using this engine- Anyone can make a great game from this if they meet a set criteria. 

It may be really frustrating from the beginning when you have no idea and you'e literally just browsing through menus and trying to find out what to do and what's going on. It'll take you some hours to figure out how does some things works. once you'll watch couple tutorials, it'll become much easier than on the beginnig. I haven't played loads of it but from the around 10 hours I have spent currently on one project I have learnt many new things that I would've never learnt in a video or in the manual. Its simple and familiar look makes it easily accessible to people who have already used any of the previous engines, but is really approachable to people new to it as well. It contains a lot of features, things you can edit, things you can create on your own. It isn't only map creator and character generator. I've been focusing on character creation, creating classes, skills, items, weapons, all of the above. Like the tagline says: Simple enough for a child, powerful enough for a developer. That tagline 100% applies to the software. If you want to make your game better and create something amazing, you must go through a lot of struggle, manuals and tutorials, but that applies to all of the game engines.
Over $90 for the base game isn't worth it if you are just going to mess around for a short amount of time so if you're really interested in game engines, creating RPG's, just go for it. 
This is not a game you play from time to time, it's not something you'd turn on and play for two hours and then get bored with it. This takes a lot of trial and error to get it to make the magic more experienced users can do.

I'll probably add more things to this review as the time pass, but all I can say for now is-
RPG Maker MV is great, simply amazing engine full of opportunities."

												Game making made easy! 

RPG Maker VX Ace was a fantastic piece of software. This has then blown the ship out of the water.

One thing i would like to say is i love the enhanced GUI on top of the endless tweaks they've done.

Cant wait to spend hours on hours tearing my hair out trying to port my product to Android and Iphone, it's going to be wild!"

												RPG Maker MV is a very powerful engine that lets you create every kind of game, so not only an RPG.
RPG Maker MV is also an awesome upgrade from RPG Maker VX Ace. In fact, there are a lot of new features, such as the HD resolution, a bigger database, etc. It can exports games for Android, iOS, HTML 5, and more!!!
PROS:
+ HD resolution
+ Super user-friendly
+ Javascript!!!
+ No more hidden classes
+ Bigger database
+ Sideview battle system integrated 
+ Tons of new plugins
+ It exports games for Android, iOS, HTML 5, and more!!!
CONS:
- A bit of lag when mapping
- The integrated mapshot feature doesn't export a 1:1 map"

												Okay, picture the versatile engine of RPG Maker Ace, but add more character customizing options, more exporting options, Mac compatibility,  and other little tweaks that make this RPG Maker the one to pick up!

Yes, it's not really high-powered. And okay, as of this review, the customization option created by the community is just beginning. But this is a nice stepping stone if you're game developing-curious!"

												 Is not my favorite, actually is just superior to the XP in my opinion (The XP is pretty bad in some aspects) I got it in a free trial mode when it appeared, and even being free, didn't spend much time on it because... is just the XP with a few things new

 Pros:
 - Improved character making
 - New commands in the ""Command window""
 - Can make games for mobile
 - Tileset overlay save a lot of time, instead of make a event with a tilest piece
 
 Cons:
 - The new commands already existed as scripts for VX ace
 - The tilesets are pretty bad, following the type of XP
 - There is not many things there to do different of VX ace
 - The focus on mobile take all the flexibility of the tool

 ---===@@@@@@===---
 I tried reverse engineering in all this programs 2000, 2003, VX, VX ace, XP and now I'll try MV and so far, I stick with the VX ace, yet, is only my opinion, if you have the patience and the skils to make it work, go ahead, try for yourself, I honestly will not spend my money on this one... 
 But I'm not going to negativate this one, after all, I never know what it can do in the future, I hope I can see awesome games made in this tool"

												It's a little easier to use than VX Ace, but until there's more DLC added and a Workshop so that people can post up their own personal graphics sets for use then I'm going to stick with VX Ace, and the sprite creation is better than VX Ace."

												I'm really impressed by your work. RPG Maker MV is great and stuff. However, there is an issue in your new added function, that removes any unused files from project. I tried to use it and ALL the music from my game got removed. My custom game cursor got removed as well. All unused enemy images got deleted, sure, but that is the only thing done right. So please, fix this issue and make your program scan user's project throughly. Let it take more time, but at least we'll get what we need.
Sincerely, Andrew."
