												No mouse support
DO NOT BUY

You can change from 30 to 60 fps from the launch menu aswell as many other options

I fully realize this is a PC port of a console game, but get your act together, this is a PC, it uses mouse"

												Loving this game! Each weapon class has unique ways of fighting and the story is pretty enjoyable too! My only complaint is that the regular interaction dialogue doesn't seem to be captioned so i can't understand those parts. Other than that, i can't wait to play more!"

												This is the first game I have played in this IP and I am enjoying it so far. 

The port is great and runs fine on my PC bar one thing at max and 60FPS on fullscreen with no issues.
The only issue I have had is you NEED to play with an controller ( I use an XBOX360 so can not comment on other types)

I will update this review once I have played more of the game. But I will give a quick run down now:

(1)The game is like monster hunter but for PC
(2)The only way to advance your game is through buying/making gear.
(3)The games combat feels like Dragons dogma if you have played that you will feel right at home.
(4)Character customization is the same as in Dynasty warriors or samurai warriors it being an KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.	game after all.

As of right now the PC game market is small in Japan so proving that there is a market for players on PC will get more games such as this ported over.

So please by this game if you are interested

The Exile,

												amazing first impression.
its very similar to toukiden 1 with an open world instead of the monster hunter typical small levels.
performance is also better than toukiden 1.

if you like toukiden 1 or monster hunter games in general this is a no brainer."

												I just started playing but so far so good. It certainly is a better port than Toukiden Kiwami what with having a 60fps option.  One thing though, you absolutely need a controller to enjoy this game. You could play with a keyboard but just forget about it. It's really not ideal. Will update this review once i spen more time with the game."

												For those who are new to toukiden : its basically monster hunter but you fight demon instead; if u ask what monster hunter, err its hack and slash game where you co-op to destroy your gigantic monster body parts.

changes in toukiden 2 from the 1st :
you can zoom out ( much like bird view than 3rd person view)
added 2 weapon (shield & sword & blade whip)
katana now have new procedure to enter hyper gouge
knife you can air dash now
bow have backflip during aim mode
rifle you can reload after shooting or rapid reload

new mitama lvling system and skills

unity attack changed to demon hand, which actually destroy the part and wont regrow at all (you can actually make a demon limp with no feet now.)

if you explore map without taking mission it will be an open world ( much like MMO, with random skirmish mission)

Afterwords, I dont think you guys need a review. you would love it, just spend the money ""it's worth it""!"

												Only played into the game 4 hours but I'm already enjoying the hell out of it. A lot has been improved, including the landscapes. No loading between any rooms anymore because everything is already loaded. I was skeptical about the whole ""open-world"" thing but it seems to have been implemented very well.

Not only have two new weapon types been added (Sword and shield, chain whip) but all the other weapon types have had new moves added to them further increasing their viability and adding something to draw you back into those types so you're not spending all your time with the two new ones.

The is also a very VERY clean port. I had Kiwami on the PS4 so I can't speak for the PC version but this game runs smooth as silk on my rig. Loading times are also ridiculously short as well which is a wonder as all the ages are linked together into one giant map with no seperate ""room"" loading like in Kiwami.

The Demon-Hand thing seems just a tad gimmicky to me, though. I'm still trying to learn all it's ins-and-outs but I hardly use the damn thing.

The characters aren't as compelling as the original cast in Toukiden: Age of Demons but they get pretty damn close. Of course I'm also not very far in so I may grow to love them like I did the original cast. I do really like Benizuki though, she's pretty rad.

This part doesn't affect me as I use controller but it's a tad bit silly to not have mouse support on a PC game. I'm also wondering if this is intentional or not as I've seen some text in the game that wasn't quite... right? One of the screenshots explaining something was a Japanese screen shot and when sending my machina out on a survey the survey time was shown as ""Survey Time"" not ""long"" ""very long"" or anything like that. A few things just seems a tad weird to me so the lack of mouse support may not be intended.

All in all a very good game and a very good sequel to the original. I highly recommend picking it up."

It seems there are issues when it comes to lobbying and online multiplayer but once it works it's a great experience with friends.

												So far the game is great, combat is fun and has some depth to it. The amount of wepons and diff play styles you get to choose from is amazing, I also get steady frames and no sudden drops. 

I will deff update more as a I play. 

Pros
-Variety of weapons and play styles
-Combat and no frame issues
-Multiplayer is a blast 
-Open world

Cons
-No english voice overs (Some players might not have a problem with this)
- YOU NEED A CONTROLER (No mouse support)
-No push to talk on multiplayer (There is a way to fix this)"

												A vast improvement over the game that I recall watching TotalBiscuit criticise. The developers have learned from the mistake of the past and not only fixed all of the issues but seem to have done their own thing to set the game out from Monster Hunter.

I can say this is probably the closest we have to Monster Hunter of PC but unlike that game this one opts for a more open world over the mission arenas we had seen in Monster Hunter and God Eater.

The game has received some flak due to initial misinformation and the apparant lack of mouse support for the game but if you can forgive the lack of mouse functionality, or you use a controller (Like you really should do for any Action RPG to be honest) then you will have a very good time here."

												First of all, this is great port considering the record with Tecmo Koei ports, but it doesn't have proper mouse and keyboard support. Then there is the limitation to going up to only 1080p on the graphics department. Other than this, the game performs flawlessly, giving you the option of locking it to 30 or 60 fps. There are few graphics options, but these are sufficient. A huge step forward from Toukiden Kiwami but, considering this is an straight PS4 port (Toukiden Kiwami origins go back to the PSP-Vita and then a PS4 HD port) this was to be expected. Let's hope that future KT ports are as decent as this one.

Toukiden 2 is also a much, much better game than the original Toukiden or Kiwami. These are monster humter-esque games but with a Japanese-fantastical setting to it. The graphics have been improved, 2 new weapons have been added, the story is told in a more immersive way, The world is huge and completely open with no transitions at all. I have only played for 4 hours and the game actually feels amazingly well done and immersive. They improved a lot of things, it actually feels like a start of a new franchise. 

I would have recommended this game exclusively on a sale but, after playing a bit, not anymore! This game deserves to be bought at full price. From the looks of it and by having played previous Toukiden games, I can ssure that it will have lots of content on both single player and multiplayer modes. I honestly was thinking of refunding it like I should have done with Kiwami. Tecmo Koei has really made an effort with this one, and it shows."

- 60 fps
- great story
- awesome optimization
- sick replay value
- thousands of armors and weapons
- lots to do, tons of quests
- hours of gameplay
- literally 100 hairstyles
- kawaii waifus

BAD:
- keyboard controls is okay, but controller is 10x better

One of the best games I ever played. I don't buy a lot of games on steam but this is definitely worth it if you're into Phantasy Star Online, Monster Hunter, God Eater, etc."

												About what you would expect from a monster hunter-like game.

No mouse support, but it isn't that big of a deal. You can freely rebind keys and essentially just use your keyboard as a controler. Such as: I use right hand for camera controls (arrow keys) and left hand controls movements and attacks. Feels nice and works.

Will update later once I get some more gameplay down, but initial look isn't as bad as people think it is in regards to controls and such.

Updates: One thing I noticed that is pretty horrible is during multiplayer open mic appears to be set to ALWAYS be on. There is no option to turn it off. So if you play with friends and use mumble or team speak (and hate open mic), this will really annoy you. As well, it appears that you also have to have a team of 4 when venturing in multiplayer - so playing with a friend, I have to bring 2 NPC's, which is lame.

Game is quite fun and has a lot of variety. It is rather easy though. You have a lot of heals and if you do get knocked out you can just get ressed repeatedly. In multiplayer that means all 4 people have to get knocked out - which is incredibly rare."

												I came into buying this game under the thought that If I didn't like it or if it didn't work well like the firs one then I would refund it. I am glad to say I do not feel the need to refund this game. It runs much more smoothly then the previous port a tiny bit of lag but i feel that is based on my computer as it is below the requirements having an i5 and not an i7 core, however this lag is very miniscule and at times I forget that it is there, meaning this game is good to play even if you don't have an amazing computer. It keeps all the feels that I like abut monster hunter and adds an open world that greatly improves the hunt.  I would definetly suggest giving it a try if you are into these types of games."

												Toukiden 2 is a huge improvement from the first one and Kiwami. Not only in terms of the Port itself (aside from the lack of mouse support), but the new gameplay features and improvements are a real addition to the series. 

If you like action-hunting games like Monster Hunter, Freedom Wars or enjoyed the first Toukiden, buy this one. You won`t regret it! Great game, great fun! 

Runs at solid 60fps on my i5-4670k @3.2GHz / 8GB RAM / GTX 970 4GB"

												Toukiden 2.

Is a huge improvement to toukiden kiwami.
i saw lots of bad reviews turn up, and was worried that he port was the same as the first game.
30 fps, crashes, lag etc. (to i still enjoyed the first one allot)

Now is it better?
yes, the port runs great at 60 fps. Combat feels improved. its Toukiden but openworld.
Art style is great.
Characters (so far) are fun.
Story (so far) is kind of the same.
Gameplay, well its what makes these types of games amazing. its even better since its 60 fps.

Its a great game if you enjoy openworld type rpg's or like Hunter games.
its a dam good mix. And i do hope they will keep making the next entry like this.
improve uppon the things they did now.

So whats bad?
No mouse support. But thats about it actually... 
i play these types of games with a controller. Always have, always will.

Its refreshing to see that koei tried something new with one of there IP's.
and i encourage them to do so more and more.
The more they experement, the more of these types of new mix of games we will get.

Pc gaming is changing in a good way. More and more niche titles appear.
More and more console only games come to pc step by step.

I for such support this. 

Toukiden 2 is a great new entry in the hunting genre as in its franchise.

Enjoy the game."

												This is a great game, and reminds me a alot of monster hunter for the 3ds

       - It a great looking game, visuals are pretty nice, actually feels as if im in a mmo like Tera for instance
       
       -Runs at 60 fps

       - Music in this game is nice as well
       
       -Combat in this game fun and challenging 

       -Lots of content and weapons to use, on a side note each weapon has it own combos and moveset that takes getting   used to  

       -Online seems to be a bit slow (probs my connection doe)

On my personal opinion I want to state that as Koei game i never expect to use the Keyboard and mouse, always a controller because to me Koei never makes using the keyboard fun. So if you have a controller, have fun but if not good luck."

												i haven't got into deep gameplay (i assume it would be the same with some additions) and story yet, i'll update it later, this is my opinion so far.
this is what we will get in toukiden 2 that are better than the first one

+better graphic, and by better i mean a lot
+60 fps master race !!!!!
+EXCELLENT PORT !!!!
+better character customization, your slayer is now getting closer to be your dream waifu
+2 new weapons

-unfortunately, according to other players, the game has no mouse support <<<< this is the reason why this game got so many downvotes.

Since I'v already got an Xbox controller and loved the first game, I 've found no problem so far


For those who are deciding to buy this game.

-If you already got a controller and loved the first toukiden game, don't hesitate. You'll have eyegasm + feels coming in

-If you already got a controller but haven't played a toukiden game, as a person who really loved the first one, i'd recommend you to get it. Keep it in mind that it isn't as hard and challenging as Monster Hunter games, and the monster hunting isn't as deep too (no tools and planning, you just go out and smack them monsters down with faster combat system). As a Monster Hunter player aswell, I'm not gonna say which one is better, both games have their own charms that make them different from each other. These 2 franchises are my babies, I'm in love with both.

-If you got no controller, don't buy this game YET. Just get the cheapest controller you can find if you don't wanna invest the high-end ones. Believe me it's gonna be worth it.
Unless you are not into monster hunting games or you are a die-hard Monster Hunter fanboy overflowing with hate to other monster hunting games."

												Extremely good game, just remember a few things:
A.  It's a hunting game.  And all this implies (seeing same enemies a lot, using body parts to craft gear, and so on).  If you enjoyed God Eater you will probably like it.
B.  Use a controller.  Extremely minimal mouse support, more importantly this type of game feels 10x better with a controller.  Sounds like you need to download the ps4 drivers yourself if you have a DS4 fyi.
C.  If you want the game to be harder, don't bring AI companions.  They are insanely good, can rez you, don't die themselves, and can kill most things without your help.  Just bring your waifu/husbando if you must.  Makes farming random parts a lot easier with a full party honestly.
D.  All the dialogue is in Japanese.  I consider this a plus mostly, but it is a bit off putting when you never know what their random comments in the game world mean.  So far the translation has been pretty good though.
E.  Max is 60 fps with 1080p resolution.  No freaking idea when this became a ""letdown"".  

So far I'm loving it.  Action is pretty fun, there's a ton of combat systems in place and I haven't tried most of the weapons yet.  Haven't gotten bored with my Weighted Sickle at all.  I've had no issues whatsoever when playing, maybe a tiny bit of slowdown during one fight that had tons of adds as well as my summons and a full team.  Otherwise runs flawless.  Haven't tried multiplayer yet, so can't comment on that.

Was worth every penny."

												I'm going to start by letting you all know that i am a HUGE monster hunter fan, i've probably put over 500+ hours on the MH games. Now since i live in Canada i have no access to the online version, i tried monster hunter 4 but its just not the sam e when playing in a small ♥♥♥ screen, i loved MHTRI alot and oplaying it on the big screen! Ever since then i`ve been on a quest of finding an alternative. When God Eater came out i was amped, even though the graphics was WAAAAY too `cartoony`for my liking, i tried to endure it... but when i found out that the game was region locked.. totally turned me off.. empty lobbies, have to go to different group chats to find people to play with and so on.. it was such a hassle.. so i gave up on it, i tried KIWAMI but by the time i started playing it was dead. Now, when toukiden 2 came out i bought it since it was onsale and wasn`t 80$ like every other game right now that just came out, so i tried it out. I`m going to be honest with you guys, i skipped the open world and tried to breeze through it, just till the multiplayer part anyways, ( im a hunter) i dont care about free roam, im searching for a solid drop in-drop out type of lobby style where you go get the quest and hunt! TBH with all of you the graphic style of the game was something youll really get used too after trhe training, its a mixture of MH and GE tbh honest with you (art style). I was amazed when i first saw the crafting system of this game, it gives the monster hunter feeling. Everytime i beat a new boss or type of animal a new set of armor pops up.. which is pretty cool, the HUGE thing i liked about MH is how you get to make armor out of the monsters you kill almost as if your showing off what you slayed but wearing their scales! Found its the same here in toukiden! I was skeptic about the whole Demon-Like types of monsters because in God-Eater their monsters were just.. too anime for me i guessÉ I was down for the whole dinosaur-monster like monsters that MH gives you. A few battles here and there and each new boss i see i end up loving! They transform into another form, and if anything they get harder than the monsters in monster hunter... i feel as if the monsters stay hard and challenging but at the same time the way they made it so you can heal yourself and use other awesome skills made the game a little easier, (a little). The game is still very challenging.. we did this exploration at tier 2 which had like 5 bossess in the dungeon which was really some sword art online feeling when your in that multi level boss dungeon,also you encounter this type of dungeon really earlier in the multi.. now i dont review alot of ♥♥♥♥ but this game is WORTH reviewing, the gameplay is so fricking smooth, the multiplayer is just top of the notch monster slying.. the demons are crazy.. they all turn into something crazier and playing this online is just... wow.. dont even get me started with the weapon crafting.. right off the bat you unlock like 30 difeernt types of weapons per weapon category (might bo overexatterated) but i didnt like a few monster hunter qwuests and ended up having a ♥♥♥♥ load of new weapon types to unlock.. also also also also THE ELEMENTAL FRICKING WEAPONS AND ARMORS ate you can unlock.. just.. wow.. and you know what.. this is only the beginning for me.. still cant wait to see whats in store... :) See you all in the game and i hope this sheds a fight light on your guys doubts abou tthis game.. this is THE BEST ALTERNATIVE FOR MONSTER HUNTER FANS!

												I was expecting for the worst since the Toukiden Kiwami (pc) didn't launch the game for me (and have to refund it...), but it didn't. The game actually launched so I was able to enjoy myself on the beginning for awhile. No complication on my end, but we'll see as I progress. Can't wait to waste my Spring Break on this."

												Huge improvement over Toukiden 1 and Kiwami. It's taken forever for one of these Monster Hunter type games to embrace an open world design. Definitely doesn't feel like Koei-Tecmo's usual Warriors gimmick where they slap a couple new characters in it, rework the story a tad and release a bare bones sequel. They actually mixed it up a great deal. The character models are a lot better, and the character customization is much deeper. The Demon's Hand and ""soul dash"" mechanics make traversing the world fun. I've got an old GTX 770, I'm getting a solid 60 fps with settings maxed out. We finally got 60 fps, and in that regard the better port, because both PS4 and Vita are stuck at 30 fps. Sure there's no mouse support, Do people honestly not have a PS3/PS4, 360/Xbone controller lying around that they can plug into their pc's? If not, just use your keyboard and the lock on features to minimize the need for a mouse. But the game wasn't designed for mouse and keyboard, if you can afford these games new, go get a controller already. O.o 

My only gripes for Omega Force would be to try to better match Monster Hunter's difficulty. That and substantially up the world's graphics, with recent titles like Hyrule Warriors and Dragon Quest Heroes we know they're capable. Omega Force needs to step into the next generation already instead of tending to frequently hang two generations behind everyone else graphically. It's most likely the Vita that's holding everyone back. The game is a blast though. Hopefully as they perfect the hunting game formula they can eventually prod Capcom into playing with the big dogs again where big monsters belong----on the big screen. The 3DS 800 x 240 res 4.88' screen just doesn't cut it for slaying life sized dragons and it's a shame."

No fps issues 
No glitch issues

Overall a solid game/port and look forward to hunting with others."

												Ignoring lousy KB/mouse support and lack of 2k/4k res, decent port which I'm enjoying more then #1. Fun to play and interesting story, something I always felt Monster Hunter lacked. Bring a gamepad and hit me up for co-op. ;D (970/3770k video below)

												Toukiden 2 is for those who like Monster Hunt like games but instead of Prehistoric time or Post Apocalyptic of God Eater/Freedom Wars, this will be in the setting of Japanese Mythology Lore.
If you own the 1st game, you will get bonus items from the save file. Also you don't need the 1st game as the Story setting will be different.

Pros:
Its a Ps4 Port, not the VITA, No Ps3 due to it being exclusive to Japan Only.
Supports 30FPS to 60FPS.
Currently having steady 60FPS gameplay experience.
Only 2 Language which you can choose upon the Launcher though Japanese was its Default.
It's Graphics quite Improved from the Previous game.
Customization has been improved slightly.
You get 5 DLC for free within a month after Launch before it becomes a Paid DLC. (Its mostly a Stats Buff and you get a free Kitsune Armor also known as Tenko but in Japanese Term, they don't have the same meaning)
World exploration has shifted to be open world. Hunting grounds from previous games return with alterations.
You get to run faster now with the R3 Analog Button. You get a special particle effect like Sonic. Its called ""Stormrunner""
Day & Night cycle.
Japanese Voice Language only but its makes it more fitting and suitable for the game setting. Quite clear and perfect.
11 Weapons to choose from as your starting weapon but once you reach the HUB, you can change your default weapons.
Music is as Beautiful as it is.
Characters art-style is quite well done. Water-paint Art in a Traditional way. 

Cons:
It defaults run on Integrated so you must manually open your NVIDIA Panel to run it on your GPU.
http://imgur.com/a/CAiiy <--Follow these Instruction.
Minor Stuttering but that's due to Steam Overlay so might need to disable that unless otherwise.
Horrible Online Lobby Always Open Mic.... (Get Discord or something)
You can't mute Voice chat.

Neutral:
K+M not Support because KT is well known to cater/favour console so get a bloody Gamepad.
3 Save Slots
No V-Sync settings so those with GSync Monitor, I have no idea.
Those who just started or new to the series, There is a saying, ""Easy to Play, Difficult to Master"".
Its resolution supports from 640 x 360 / 640 x 480 to 1920 x 1080 / 1920 x 1080.
Windows 7 will have the most Issues but, you only have yourself to blame *cough*
CPU Usage Varies. The Factors are OS, CPU and GPU.
Graphic Varies on Users GPU and Settings. ReShade/SweetFX is Optional.

Overall: A Good Steady Launch from my experience.
Note: Might upload a Youtube Gameplay later on or never. (Did a Shadowplay Recording but Video ended up with the ""Dark Bug"")
Review will always be update in Progress.
-24 Salty people QQing they can't run mainly due to not Upgrading and 4k salty minority monitor users.

												Yes, lets all pour on negative reviews for lack of mouse support,

Let's completely disregard

- completely smooth at all times at 60 fps 
- fantastic monster hunter-esque gameplay, something that's severely lacking on pc
- tight controls on controller
- online co-op, fight badass monsters with your buddies
- good soundtrack

This is everything me and many more would want in a pc game.

The fact that it's still only at 'mostly positive', and started out as 'overwhelmingly negative' is a ♥♥♥♥ing travesty."

												Toukiden 2. How should I say this?

It is such a great improvement from Kiwami. Seriously. 
Considering how bad that port was, this was so much better. I barely had any crashes, and lag just wasn't there. The funny thing is, all those bad reviews when the game first came out was from no mouse and keyboard support. Just buy a controller and play this game if you're a Monster Hunter fan, it's a great substitute for PC. But if you want a Pros and Cons list, here you go.

PROS:

-Graphically pleasing, not the best, but it's still cool.

-Decent story, though a little rushed at times (But that's just me nitpicking)

-A lot of armor sets and weapons (They even added about two more weapon types, sword & shield and chain & whip)

-Characters can be pretty amusing at times, it doesn't feel like they're just robots saying the lines because they were ordered to.

-Voice acting is great too.

-Gameplay is great.

-Game isn't too difficult, or too easy.

-Grammar mistakes at times, but this always gives me a laugh so I'll put it here, in PROs. (This is also me nitpicking)

-Has multiplayer. (Though if you want to play with less than four friends, you'd have to take NPCs with you. But that's it.)

CONS:

-The Multiplayer has a built in mic, which I honestly don't want to use. So far I'm not sure if there's a way to turn off the mic.

-No Keyboard+Mouse support, but honestly, this isn't such a big problem. You can easily just configure your keyboard to your liking, or just buy a controller, which I highly suggest you do.

In conclusion, Toukiden 2 is a great game. Buy it. If you don't think it's worth the price, wait for some sort of a sale. Then buy it."

												Sure, it's not a perfect port, but if you don't need 4K and mouse support, it's servicable. Runs pretty well on my old-ish laptop (dual core i5 and GTX860M), crashed one time, but otherwise no issues. Game feels like a Monster Hunter reskin, much more so than God Eater. And since there's no MH on PC, I have to say that's a good thing. Compared to MH combat is much more smooth and fast paced. Attacks combo nicely and you have grappling hook to zip around the battlefield and grab monsters with. It's a fun game in a genre that's not so common on the platform, go get it."

												Toukiden 2 is a huge improvement from the first one and Kiwami. Not only in terms of the Port itself (aside from the lack of mouse support), but the new gameplay features and improvements are a real addition to the series. 

If you like action-hunting games like Monster Hunter, Freedom Wars or enjoyed the first Toukiden, buy this one. You won`t regret it! Great game, great fun!

												Mouse and Keyboard support is not present in anykind of usefull manner. The menues are not fully translated, nore do they indicare the correct keys on a keyboard. When it says press any key, it does not mean press any key. And, the Resolution settings do not support 16:10 or higher aspect ratios, nore is anything above 1920 X 1080 supported.

All told a slopy port done in a half ♥♥♥♥♥ manner. I recomend only playing it, if you output to a TV and have a controler. It would be nice to actualy get to play the game, but as I do not have a controler handy...

They really need to add Requiers a Controler to the min system requierments. Preferably, they need to fully support KB&M. Maybe in a patch."

												About what you would expect from a monster hunter-like game.

No mouse support, but it isn't that big of a deal. You can freely rebind keys and essentially just use your keyboard as a controler. Such as: I use right hand for camera controls (arrow keys) and left hand controls movements and attacks. Feels nice and works.

Will update later once I get some more gameplay down, but initial look isn't as bad as people think it is in regards to controls and such.

Updates: One thing I noticed that is pretty horrible is during multiplayer open mic appears to be set to ALWAYS be on. There is no option to turn it off. So if you play with friends and use mumble or team speak (and hate open mic), this will really annoy you. As well, it appears that you also have to have a team of 4 when venturing in multiplayer - so playing with a friend, I have to bring 2 NPC's, which is lame.

Game is quite fun and has a lot of variety. It is rather easy though. You have a lot of heals and if you do get knocked out you can just get ressed repeatedly. In multiplayer that means all 4 people have to get knocked out - which is incredibly rare."

												I know I don't have much playtime and i know a lot of people will complain about that, but just stay with me for a second and let me explain.

The game it self is a lot better then the first one.
The graphics are okay.
Its nothing to jump up and scream about, but it definitely does the job. 
(Could be more graphical settings in my opinion) 

The sounds track is nice and the sound engineering is on point.


So why am I giving it a thumbs down? 

Because the games has no real mouse support at all.
This is on PC and I know a lot of you will say: But games like this are meant to be played with a controller. And I agree! But you must understand not everyone will nor want to use a controller.

Overall there are some minor issues while tabbing in and out of the game.
But port-wise besides the mouse there is nothing major wrong it.


It's a HUGE step-up from the first game they released on PC.


Do I recommend getting the game now? 
Completely up to you, but my two cents are.

If you are okay with the no real mouse support and the OK graphics then yes go for it.
If you are not okay with these issues then I recommend waiting.


PS: I know I talked mostly about the port, that's because I have not gotten to far in the game yet, but what i have seen so far its definitely an okay game.
(I will change this review as I progress in the game)"

												Open world Toukiden! It's for sure an improvment over the previous games.

So far it's shown to be a great port, which is suprising coming from KOEI TECMO. No issues on this side. 
Bewarned though, some people are having issues getting it to launch. It seems if you can launch it, it's smooth sailing from there. Put that Steam refund capability to use if it's not launching. Highly recommend using a controller to play, as there's currently no mouse support. I've had zero issues using an Xbone controller.

With that said, I'm stoked to what see what kind of crazy Oni I'll get to slay in this round of Toukiden."

												For those who are new to toukiden : its basically monster hunter but you fight demon instead; if u ask what monster hunter, err its hack and slash game where you co-op to destroy your gigantic monster body parts.

changes in toukiden 2 from the 1st :
you can zoom out ( much like bird view than 3rd person view)
added 2 weapon (shield & sword & blade whip)
katana now have new procedure to enter hyper gouge
knife you can air dash now
bow have backflip during aim mode
rifle you can reload after shooting or rapid reload

new mitama lvling system and skills

unity attack changed to demon hand, which actually destroy the part and wont regrow at all (you can actually make a demon limp with no feet now.)

if you explore map without taking mission it will be an open world ( much like MMO, with random skirmish mission)

Afterwords, I dont think you guys need a review. you would love it, just spend the money ""it's worth it""!"

-Combat and no frame issues
-Multiplayer is a blast 
-Open world

Cons
-No english voice overs (Some players might not have a problem with this)
- YOU NEED A CONTROLER (No mouse support)

												Huge improvement over Toukiden 1 and Kiwami. It's taken forever for one of these Monster Hunter type games to embrace an open world design. Definitely doesn't feel like Koei-Tecmo's usual Warriors gimmick where they slap a couple new characters in it, rework the story a tad and release a bare bones sequel. They actually mixed it up a great deal. The character models are a lot better, and the character customization is much deeper. The Demon's Hand and ""soul dash"" mechanics make traversing the world fun. I've got an old GTX 770, I'm getting a solid 60 fps with settings maxed out. We finally got 60 fps, and in that regard the better port, because both PS4 and Vita are stuck at 30 fps. Sure there's no mouse support, Do people honestly not have a PS3/PS4, 360/Xbone controller lying around that they can plug into their pc's? If not, just use your keyboard and the lock on features to minimize the need for a mouse. But the game wasn't designed for mouse and keyboard, if you can afford these games new, go get a controller already. O.o 

My only gripes for Omega Force would be to try to better match Monster Hunter's difficulty. That and substantially up the world's graphics, with recent titles like Hyrule Warriors and Dragon Quest Heroes we know they're capable. Omega Force needs to step into the next generation already instead of tending to frequently hang two generations behind everyone else graphically. It's most likely the Vita that's holding everyone back. The game is a blast though. Hopefully as they perfect the hunting game formula they can eventually prod Capcom into playing with the big dogs again where big monsters belong----on the big screen. The 3DS 800 x 240 res 4.88' screen just doesn't cut it for slaying life sized dragons and it's a shame."

												I really wanted to like this game since I played Toukiden Kiwami on PS4 and enjoyed it quite a bit, so an improved version on pc should have been awesome. Should have been.
The game started with a small launcher, an oddity but not unheard of. It showed the launcher in Japanese by default, but it was easy to change this to English. After this I saw that windowed mode was also the default so I also changed this.
But this is only the launcher right? Nope.

When entering the menu I found out the prompts were for an xbox controller even though I didn't have one plugged in. Decided to change a few options first. Saw the video settings by default were locked to 30 fps so I changed this to 60 since they can't be unlocked also changed details to high from medium.
This didn't affect gameplay for me, but I have a 1070 GTX so I am not exactly the ""average"" player on that front.
After changing the video options I went to sound options and saw that sound is a slider that ranges from small to large instead of soft to loud or low to high. A small thing, but translation is kind of a big deal if you don't understand the original language (Japanese). Seeing the translation in the menu I decided to skip the story since I don't trust the translation.

When starting to play I noticed the attention that character creation got which was nice. A lot of hairstyles etc. and quite a few sliders for things. It was nice to create the character I had on PS4 and improve on her appearance with more options.

After this the game started and I started to test the controls in the ""tutorial"". I put tutorial between quotes since it showed controls for an xbox controller instead of mouse and keyboard.
The first thing I noticed was that the mouse isn't used...at all. Instead you adjust the camera with G,H,J, and T while moving with W, A, S, and D. This came over really weird while playing, so I wanted to change the camera controls to numpad since mouse wasn't an option. As it turns out numpad cannot be used at all and neither can the arrows so you are pretty much stuck with awkward controls.
After movement I tested attacking with J, I, K, and L. Picking up items requires you to press and hold O and using magic is done by holding O and pressing one of the attack keys.
While pressing keys randomly I didn't get lock on to work and I was just about done with the entire control setup, but I decided to finish the tutorial with keyboard only and I can tell this game is absolute garbage when playing with keyboard since you need 3 hands with fingers ranging from A to L to play optimally without lock on.
After the tutorial I plugged in a dualshock 4 controller noticed the game didn't acknowledge it. No biggy I will restart the game since it most likely is a bug with playing it in while playing. Again a no since the controller can't be used. I also noticed this with Dark Souls 3 and find it odd that a game that also releases on PS4 can't use a PS4 controller. With this game however I find it a bigger deal since this game only releases on PS4 and PC and can't even be used with the controller of 1 of the 2 platforms.

This was the point where I decided to go for a refund since I was done. I dont want to control my character with W, A, S, and D while controlling the camera with T, F, G, H and also attacking with I, J, K, and L. The person who tested controls was either drunk and just said it was great or a mutant. Locking on might resolve the camera control issue, but when playing Kiwami I didn't use lock on all that much, so I don't want to adjust my playstyle in such a way just to get past a limitation in the controls that shouldn't be there.
Maybe I will check the game again if it can be used with DS4 or when it has proper mouse and keyboard controls, but right now I just couldn't enjoy it at all and uninstalled it after the tutorial. I doubt it though."

												i haven't got into deep gameplay (i assume it would be the same with some additions) and story yet, i'll update it later, this is my opinion so far.
this is what we will get in toukiden 2 that are better than the first one

+better graphic, and by better i mean a lot
+60 fps master race !!!!!
+EXCELLENT PORT !!!!
+better character customization, your slayer is now getting closer to be your dream waifu
+2 new weapons

-unfortunately, according to other players, the game has no mouse support <<<< this is the reason why this game got so many downvotes.

Since I'v already got an Xbox controller and loved the first game, I 've found no problem so far


For those who are deciding to buy this game.

-If you already got a controller and loved the first toukiden game, don't hesitate. You'll have eyegasm + feels coming in

-If you already got a controller but haven't played a toukiden game, as a person who really loved the first one, i'd recommend you to get it. Keep it in mind that it isn't as hard and challenging as Monster Hunter games, and the monster hunting isn't as deep too (no tools and planning, you just go out and smack them monsters down with faster combat system). As a Monster Hunter player aswell, I'm not gonna say which one is better, both games have their own charms that make them different from each other. These 2 franchises are my babies, I'm in love with both.

-If you got no controller, don't buy this game YET. Just get the cheapest controller you can find if you don't wanna invest the high-end ones. Believe me it's gonna be worth it.
Unless you are not into monster hunting games or you are a die-hard Monster Hunter fanboy overflowing with hate to other monster hunting games."

The game run super smooth at stable 60 FPS, I had no issues since I started playing, no bug, no crash, everything is perfect!
People that put a bad review on this game are probably just trolls that doesnt know how a PC works!
You'll read on some post that the KB/M support isnt really there..So what? A simple X360 AfterGlow controller or if you have a ps4, use Ds4windows and boom, it works!

Controls work great
Graphics are nice for this kind of game!
The multiple weapon choice and combos are sweet!

Only thing I saw by their website was the number of Large Oni that seems low(I might be mistaken)

Overall, a great game for those who loves the Monster Hunter series and wants this kind of game on PC!
Its a buy
Dont be that gamer that will cry in tears because its 2017 and no KB/M <---which we dont care"

												First of all; if you don't have a controller, do not get this game.
It lacks mouse support so your options are keyboard or controller.

This little review also assumes you've tried the first one or are familiar with monster hunting games. And it's spoiler free. But there's not much to spoil anyway.

What I love:
Open World - In most monster hunting games, you have a village that acts as a hub. In that hub, you can choose which missions to go out on and you go to the general mission area. From there, you have all these little instances of maps that you go through one by one til you get to the final zone and then you get ported back. That's gone from this game. You actually just walk out of the village and explore the oni infested lands with some party members.

Mission Structure - I feel like I needed to separate this part before I get off track before I talk about the quests any further. Story missions will have you go out into the open world to complete your stuff. You also complete some side quests this way (e.g. find this person, kill the oni hanging out by that tree over there, I can't leave this cave with that oni right outside, basic fetch quest, basic escort quest). 

Then there are ""Phase Missions"" where you talk to someone at the front desk and when you leave the village, you'll get ported to the exact area you're supposed to be. Then you just kill everything in the vicinity. Pretty watered down version of the older monster hunting style quests.

Combat - You get an item early on called the ""Demon Hand"" that allows you to grapple towards objects and enemies a la Attack on Titan. This is so huge for movement in these games. Bosses often fly across the map and it sucks catching up to them only for them to fly across again. Last time I played a game like this that gave you a good amount of movement was Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce. All weaponsets have a small dodge while some have also have guard/parry. It's pretty fast paced if you play with the right weapons. To mix things up for your playstyle are the Mitama that you attach to your gear. Some specialize in dealing damage, destroying monster body parts, moving quickly, movement impairing, healing, buffing, tanking, etc.

Things I like:
Upgrading weapons - Kill monsters for their parts and use them to upgrade weapons in several different ways. You can either increase its raw damage, critical rate, or elemental damage. Then you can reforge them into stronger variations.
Armor works the same. Increase defense or increase the rate of your health regen (but not really, idk it's stupid).

A.I. - Monsters behave how they're supposed to. Party members are pretty efficient. Have yet to run into issues.

Complaints (so far):

Mini map - Kinda hard to navigate with it. You can resize it but all the sizes are just so awkward. I think if the character indicator arrows also resized with it. Arrow points in the direction of the story quest but you can't get it to track other quests. It also doesn't help navigate you to the quest, as in which path you should take. You'll go down one fork in the road only to end up having to backtrack pretty far back. This wasn't a problem til I got to....... the snow area.

So you have to do is press Start and press X to see the full map, not the map that shows up when you initially press Start. At least you can set waypoints but I think that works the same as the stupid arrow in the minimap.

Terminology - I swear that this is the worst thing about this game (because I'm not having technical issues :D   ).
Your passives will refer to all these different abilities and you don't even know what they are. Example,
Onslaught+ (Orthodox)
Increases the damage you inflict when attacking an Oni from straight on when using Onslaught.
Cannot find Onslaught in the game's encyclopedia. Orthodox? What significance does that word have? ""Straight on"" probably means when you're not attacking an enemy from behind. Does the side count? I wish there was a way to highlight keywords and the game will show you what it is in the game.

Demon Hand - For the most part it's great. But when you aim with it by holding RT, you can't cancel out of it unless you dodge which uses up your focus/stamina. Or you can just let it go and whiff it. Why would you cancel out of it in the first place? Cause you think you can grapple on to an enemy but then they're not in range anymore or you misjudged the distance. A small and partial fix for this would be to change the color of the lock on target indicator when an enemy's in range of the demon hand.

Day/Night - There's a day/night cycle. It makes a small difference. Oni are more powerful at night. Some sidequests can only be completed at night. In a few areas, you can't really tell if it's day or night so to have an icon on the minimap and in the main map would be helpful.

Haven't touched:
Multiplayer - Waiting for a friend. Also can't find a random lobby. PS4 might have more luck or Andromeda is stealing the crowd lol.
Item Synthesis - Doesn't look useful yet. Maybe later in the game.
Bonding with party members - Don't really know the purpose of this. I have an idea based on the first game though.
Sending gatherers out to bring back materials every X minutes - Well, I do this. But it always fails. Need to upgrade gatherers a bit more but to do so is pretty difficult.

												Yes, lets all pour on negative reviews for lack of mouse support,

Let's completely disregard

- completely smooth at all times at 60 fps 
- fantastic monster hunter-esque gameplay, something that's severely lacking on pc
- tight controls on controller
- online co-op, fight badass monsters with your buddies
- good soundtrack

This is everything me and many more would want in a pc game.

The fact that it's still only at 'mostly positive', and started out as 'overwhelmingly negative' is a ♥♥♥♥ing travesty."

												I can only hope toukiden doesn't do what almost every worthwhile vita game does by offering a much better version to sell full price down the road. I'm saying this because if they offer nintendo a product they may do that. 

In toukiden, you play as a demon slayer hunting down oni and sending them off Monster hunter style. Mitama, fallen soldiers slain by oni, accompany you, offering special active and passive abilities that assist you in battle. Same general idea with equipment, you need the power of your enemies to stand a chance. Nothing new here. Though the grapple arm has special attack and defense attributes that offer some more versatility. The combat is smooth, but to be honest, I am nowhere near being able to take down anything significant in a reasonable amount of time. 

The main difference between this and the other hunters, including the first toukiden, is that instead of short bursts of quests and intense battles, it's a much smoother slow burn of exploration and combat, that doesn't make you feel weird for having a big PC just to play a bunch of 10-15 minute missions, and watch cutscenes. Granted some are longer, but the point still stands.

Toukiden 2 should be what we want, a feature filled open world hunter rpg that actually uses a healthy combination of open areas, movement and action mechanics, as well as augmentations that anyone would think about while playing, like mid attack evasion, invincibility, critical attacks, stamina recovery, attack buffs defence buffs, and recovering your magic use through sending demons. A combination of spirits that slightly or drastically alter the gameplay through skills and magic. Light heavy and signature attacks that offer more expansive types of combat. Everything is there.

Is it worth 60 or so dollars? I would almost always say no. But to be honest, if this is what people want, they need to show for it in sales, This is one less game we need to buy a different console for or wait a decade or so to be able to play it. And because the vita is on its way out, that's one less platform holding the game back down the line. And I'd like to think that koei is not going to let a series die once they started it up. I will admit that depending on your taste in hunter games you may be better off holding out, and I will also admit that if capcom took a look outside and decided that they want to make a PC monster hunter or another dragons dogma that gets finished, I will have a few regrets. The concept they decided to push is worth the money. But I can't help wondering why no one else was doing it. Because upon a closer look, it does look like they're reusuing assets."

												This stupid game must come from 50s' or even earlier. I have 2 1080 ti graphic cards in my alienware, but this game feels like a shxt in my pc. It must be created by some pre-school children. I am fine with that, but please market it at 1 dollar or for free. It is worth only that much.  I have no idea why there are still people think it's a good game. In that case, maybe win95 is their best windows operation system too. lol. This game may even be a bad one on my phone for the poor graphic and funny music. It's like listening to happy pop music when someone' parents just died. The old story line of the game is just another trash. They must pick up the story when they are in toilets. I refunded, I even want to sue them for wasting my time to download it. Send more people to say trash on my reviews and I don't care about those trash. 

For those smart people, just don't waste ur money or time.

And there are trash talking about teaching language in a game. lol. trash are trash forever, they don't even have brains and I don't need to give a shxt.

But there is one guy saying something right under the comments. So I re-edit my reviews for those smart people.

There is also one chinese guy saying ""Don't lose ur face with ur english"" in Chinese, That funny boy may drink too much pee of his mom, I delete his words by mistake, I want to mark him as a trash and maybe ""lose his face"" like his whole life did to him.

BUT after all, remember, just don't buy this game. It is a 1 dollar game sold for stupid people's 60 dollars.

Bite me~

Yeah, I came back one more time and this is the last time I add some thing new to my review. I explain that I have two 1080ti (actually a bunch of them) and an alienware (actually four, two upstairs and two downstars.) only because there is a stupid guy saying MY PC IS A ♥♥♥♥ under the comments. lol, These graphic cards and pcs are not expensive to me. LOL. so I don't care. I'm not showing off anything, They are just some normal things for me to play games. And they are good enough to not be ""♥♥♥♥ pcs"".


And there is also a stupid guy saying that if I have them, why do I care about 60 dollars for this stupid game. GOOD QUESTION. Because, though I earn enough money, I don't feed them to stupid game company which produce stupid games. So, I warn people who are smart enough to not download them. You are very welcome. 

Goodbye. REVIEW will stay here and mark it please. haha.

bad game deserve to die. And no matter who they hire to trash talk here, I wont delete it. Thanks steam a lot."

												The game's fun, smooth controls -> (Playing with a Keyboard) you'll get used to it, if you've been playing other similar games to this. Had a problem with graphics, but that's because of the dual-integrated graphic on my laptop detecting the Intel graphic card, so if anybody has FPS issues, just force change your graphic card. 

Anyways porting is good, storyline is interesting and a general above the average character customization. 
Combat is smooth and not clunky, so far enjoying now with a smooth frame rate at maximum graphic setting. (GTX 850M) no problems."

												Funny enough, when this game first hit it had tons of negative reviews, and you know what they were all complaining about? Controller support. Other than that, this game supports 60 FPS and is optimized very well, the graphics are also taken from the PS4 version yet again so while not absolutely stunning, the visuals are very clean and solid.

Anyway, if you're not that shallow and can look past the fact that the Keyboard and Mouse controls for this game are practically non existant, then what you'll find here is something truely beautiful.

Toukiden 2 is the kind of game where once you play it, you'll be witnessing the transformation of a game that was merely ""another of it's genre"" into it's own unique identity.

In the first Toukiden, you could very much say that it's basically Toei's version of a Monster Hunter game, with a little more focus on getting in on the action instead of gathering and preparing for the fight (whether that's a good thing or not is entirely up to preferance). But now, Toukiden 2 has pulled out all the stops and decided to go in it's own direction completely. It's a sequel that does the concept of sequels justice.

Toukiden 2 keeps all of the main mechanics from the first game that made it a MonHun style game, but improves on every aspect. Combat definitely feels a little more fluid and now there are two new weapons to try out as well. But that's where the similarities to the ever advancing MonHun series stops.

First thing you'll notice (at least in singleplayer) is that Toukiden 2 is a seemless fully open world game. There aren't any loading screens when you're exploring in the open world, only in cutscenes and mission modes. This alone changes the entire feeling of the game, it's massive and it's full of huge monsters to slay. The game then lets you take your entire party out into the open world, so now you've got a party based action heavy MonHun-like game that's set in an open world, you'll feel like it's got some Dragon's Dogma vibes going on, and that's incredible. Not only that, but in some areas, it'll feel like you're delving into something akin to Phantasy Star Online at times as well.

It starts meshing to the point where it's hard to simply compare it to one or two games of established genres and you'll see how it just becomes a crock pot of gaming ideas that forms into something that can only be Toukiden 2.

As for the multiplayer, it basically progresses like a classic MonHun game, where you just do missions, murder stuff, make stuff out of the stuff you murdered, then murder more stuff. It's a vicious cycle but it still works very well. There is however, no open world for multiplayer, but don't let that turn you away because there are what's known as ""Patrol Missions"" where they let you just roam around entire sections of the open world like the starting hill area or the entire zone including all the areas under the ""Age of Peace"" label and so on and so forth, which honestly, is more than enough considering that aside from the very first open world area, the places you can go to are absolutely massive.

Overall, I would say that unlike the first game which had an abysmal launch, if you're a fan of MonHun style games or even just Action RPG games then this one's a must buy. It takes all the things that worked in the first and improves upon everything while doing so many things new that while it may feel similar, it will also feel completely new and fresh at the same time.

TL;DR Summary
Okay so, you take Dynasty Warrirors' Style, Monster Hunter's Gameplay, Dragon's Dogma's Open World JRPG Feeling, and Toukiden's Setting, throw them all into a blender and MIX THE **** OUT OF THEM. Then you get this game. It's a mish mashed monster, but it has all the good crispy bits, and who doesn't like crispy bits?

TL;DR Basic Port Stats
- 60 FPS
- Very well optimized, runs buttery smooth
- Fullscreen basically functions as Borderless Windowed
- However the Keyboard and Mouse controls are complete trash, gonna need a controller for this one.




Oh and I forgot to mention, if you like Waifus and Husbandos, the affection system is still very much intact from the first game. Get your body ready to bathe with best girl or best guy... or both ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

												Port runs perfectly as far as I can tell a couple missions in. 

Mostly just leaving a postive recommendation because not supporting mouse in a hunting game isn't enough to say not recommeded and the current negative review reatio is dumb, hope this helps.

edit: For the actual game itself, it's pretty much Monster Hunter with Japanese mythology style. From what I'm reading it's still lighter on content than monster hunter games are, but still has more than enough to go past 50 hours. If you've never played another hunting game before, read a more in depth review. :V"

												Sure, it's not a perfect port, but if you don't need 4K and mouse support, it's servicable. Runs pretty well on my old-ish laptop (dual core i5 and GTX860M), crashed one time, but otherwise no issues. Game feels like a Monster Hunter reskin, much more so than God Eater. And since there's no MH on PC, I have to say that's a good thing. Compared to MH combat is much more smooth and fast paced. Attacks combo nicely and you have grappling hook to zip around the battlefield and grab monsters with. It's a fun game in a genre that's not so common on the platform, go get it."

There is absolutely no difference between the pc & ps4 version so there are no complaints. anyone crying about mouse support .. i just can't imagine this game with a mouse. None of the Koei games are made with mouse. All i can say is: keep up the good work Koei tecmo and thank you for releasing a pc version that works perfect."

												 First off, to my fellow weebs out there.  THE VOICES ARE IN JAPANESE! YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO A CRAPPY ENGLISH DUB LIKE WHAT BANDAI DID TO THE GOD EATER GAMES!

I always wanted to play the 1st Toukiden game but never got it because everyone said the PC port was buns. I waited a few hours for some reviews for this game before buying it. Everyone seemed to think it was a pretty good PC port besides the fact that theres no KB/Mouse support. I was totally fine with this. Hack and slash and fighting games just feel natural on a controller. The game doesn't feel as monotonous or grindy as God Eater. I hated GOD EATER because there were so many load times and the world wasn't open. It was just dungeons with the same texture and layout for more than half the game.

I am about 5 hours in so far and can say that I'm liking it. 
+Graphics are decent. IMO I don't really care much
+Feels crisp and natural on a controller (Playing on xbox 360 controller)
+Good performance (Constant 60 FPS, No glitches)
+Characters seem fleshed out. They aren't walking bots. The japanese VA's really nailed the targeted personality traits.
+Good Soundtrack
? I've yet to try out the multiplayer coop but hopefully plan to later. 

My only gripe so far is that sometimes your Mitamas or your AI teammates say something in the middle of a fight and theres no subtitles to know what they say. For an example, theres a couple times where I killed a enemy and my AI teammate Homura says 3 sentences but I have no idea what he just said. Its nothing really but just something that kinda bugs me for a bit.

If you are solely not buying the game just because theres no KB/Mouse support, I feel bad for you. You are missing out. I know that its stupid for KOEI TECHMO to not include it in the PC version but it should be expected if you've ever bought a PC ported game from them. KOEI TECHMO really outdid themselves with this PC port. The FPS cap is actually 60 and not 30 like most of their games and I haven't come across any launch or game breaking errors. Hopefully this game can last me for a few weeks."

												Toukiden 2.

Is a huge improvement to toukiden kiwami.
i saw lots of bad reviews turn up, and was worried that he port was the same as the first game.
30 fps, crashes, lag etc. (to i still enjoyed the first one allot)

Now is it better?
yes, the port runs great at 60 fps. Combat feels improved. its Toukiden but openworld.
Art style is great.
Characters (so far) are fun.
Story (so far) is kind of the same.
Gameplay, well its what makes these types of games amazing. its even better since its 60 fps.

Its a great game if you enjoy openworld type rpg's or like Hunter games.
its a dam good mix. And i do hope they will keep making the next entry like this.
improve uppon the things they did now.

So whats bad?
No mouse support. But thats about it actually... 
i play these types of games with a controller. Always have, always will.

Its refreshing to see that koei tried something new with one of there IP's.
and i encourage them to do so more and more.
The more they experement, the more of these types of new mix of games we will get.

Pc gaming is changing in a good way. More and more niche titles appear.
More and more console only games come to pc step by step.

I for such support this. 

Toukiden 2 is a great new entry in the hunting genre as in its franchise.

Enjoy the game."

												I see a lot of negative reviews for thus game in regards to the lack of keyboard and mouse support. What is this 2008? Controllers work on PC now and just as well as on consoles.

Anyway. The only bad things I can say about this game so far is that it does feel like a last generation game as far as the graphics, dialog and interface is concerned. Also, I felt like it took to long to get to the point where you can play online with friends after spamming the next button through all the text based dialog. There is way to much mandatory dialog in the beginning of this game.

Other than that, this game does seem like a Monster Hunter - like game that is either on par with MH or has ever so slightly surpassed it.
The fact that it is on the PC, on Steam, in English and has online multiplayer makes it the best Monster Hunting game in my opinion.

The combat is fluid and feels good. The monsters are interesting. There is a good amount of weapons.

All in all I do feel like the game should be about $15 to $20 cheeper for looking and feeling like a last generation game."

Wonderfully voiced with a Japanese dub (only English subs)
Open-world
A ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun
And a ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun

If you're an avid Monster Hunter fan, this is pretty close but a bit faster paced depending on the weapon you choose. Definitely worth the pickup especially while the DLC will be free for the next month.

												For those fan of Monster Hunter out there, Toukiden is so far a good mimic of  hunting monster game  with a little bit twist of Dynasty Warriors combine. Toukiden 2 is solid port with run on 60fps/1080p  with a good graphic design Koei/Tecmo.

 So far i did not see any crash or shutter at all the only this to complaint anIt's lack of supporting keyboard+ mouse so you may need to have controller to play fully enjoy this game.

At the end,  I just want to say again if you are play monster hunter series but this have console to play that , this is the game so close to that on PC for the moment you can play."

												Here's my 8 hours take on the game.

First, the boring stuff:

- No mouse support
- It's locked in 60 fps
- It's an overall superior port to the original Toukiden but it's still a port and not something created from the ground up
- Only consider this game if you have a controller; Keyboard controls are pure garbage

Now let's talk about the game.
They finally did it.
They took the Hunting genre created and maintened for years and year from Monster Hunter and created a ""clone"" that still is pretty much a clone in certain aspects while bringing a whole new flow to the gameplay.

You got your typical ""grab the quest, hunt the monster"" you are expecting from the genre but then you got a fully fledged action RPG on top of it and presented as the main course. This is one of the better open world experiences, I've stumbled into some secrets that opened new ways of bulding my own character in the game. It felt like the more I explore, the cooler the secrets I find. I'll relay this gameplay loop as my experience:

Behind a massive boulder from the souther region of the ""Age of Honor"" region of the map, there was this small shrine. I was lost, trying to find a way to reach my destination that did not travel in the ""Underworld"" cave system because if I did, my character would be poisoned by the Miasma and die.

So I stopped and decided to check on the shrine. There I found a figure of Japanese/German history I've never even heard about, Siebold (Philipp Franz von Siebold).

The character explains why his spirit was trapped there and asks for you to track a specific Demon with your ""Oni Slaying Vision"" and bring one of it's part for him to analyze.

So I track the creature, have a climatic showdown in the heart of an abandoned city and manage to bring the part to this Siebold fellow, who then is absorbed. He is one of the ""Mitama"", spirits that customize how you play the game. Think armor skills from Monster Hunter on steroids.

This partircular Mitama had a bunch of synergy with the Whip weapon, so I decided to try. Aiming explosive kunai tem smashing them with the whip and blowing up specific parts of the monster quickly turned me into an addict. And it's all thanks to this random thing I ran on the scenery that gave me the push to try different weapons, builds and approachs.

So far, this game is more than a step up from Toukiden 1 - It's a unique and refined take on the Hunting genre. When it tries to be copy cat Monhun it stumbles, but when it's being itself, it's an all around fun time. Let's see if the feeling persists through my next 8 hours."

												Crashes started on the first real mission after the intro fight. Crashed immediately upon gaining control of my character, then crashed just loading into that same fight, then I turned the graphics settings from high to medium. Thought that fixed it, then 3 minutes into that same mission, crashed again. You have to fast forward through dialogue and put up with a little bit of unskippable stuff to get from the most recent autosave to that fight. Sitting through that ♥♥♥♥ 3 times in 5 minutes is too much for me. Won't be touching this game again until it gets fixed."

												Needs a few patches here and there, but it runs a stable 60fps on my pc.
The only issue i had with this port is using a ps4 controller via steam inate support.
I had to disable steam support and use DS4win for it to work properly.
(apparently this game loves its xbox controller and wants nothing to do with ps4 ones.)

Other than that its a great game so far."

												First of all, this is great port considering the record with Tecmo Koei ports, but it doesn't have proper mouse and keyboard support. Then there is the limitation to going up to only 1080p on the graphics department. Other than this, the game performs flawlessly, giving you the option of locking it to 30 or 60 fps. There are few graphics options, but these are sufficient. A huge step forward from Toukiden Kiwami but, considering this is an straight PS4 port (Toukiden Kiwami origins go back to the PSP-Vita and then a PS4 HD port) this was to be expected. Let's hope that future KT ports are as decent as this one.

Toukiden 2 is also a much, much better game than the original Toukiden or Kiwami. These are monster humter-esque games but with a Japanese-fantastical setting to it. The graphics have been improved, 2 new weapons have been added, the story is told in a more immersive way, The world is huge and completely open with no transitions at all. I have only played for 4 hours and the game actually feels amazingly well done and immersive. They improved a lot of things, it actually feels like a start of a new franchise. 

I would have recommended this game exclusively on a sale but, after playing a bit, not anymore! This game deserves to be bought at full price. From the looks of it and by having played previous Toukiden games, I can ssure that it will have lots of content on both single player and multiplayer modes. I honestly was thinking of refunding it like I should have done with Kiwami. Tecmo Koei has really made an effort with this one, and it shows."

												 First off, to my fellow weebs out there.  THE VOICES ARE IN JAPANESE! YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO A CRAPPY ENGLISH DUB LIKE WHAT BANDAI DID TO THE GOD EATER GAMES!

I always wanted to play the 1st Toukiden game but never got it because everyone said the PC port was buns. I waited a few hours for some reviews for this game before buying it. Everyone seemed to think it was a pretty good PC port besides the fact that theres no KB/Mouse support. I was totally fine with this. Hack and slash and fighting games just feel natural on a controller. The game doesn't feel as monotonous or grindy as God Eater. I hated GOD EATER because there were so many load times and the world wasn't open. It was just dungeons with the same texture and layout for more than half the game.

I am about 5 hours in so far and can say that I'm liking it. 
+Graphics are decent. IMO I don't really care much
+Feels crisp and natural on a controller (Playing on xbox 360 controller)
+Good performance (Constant 60 FPS, No glitches)
+Characters seem fleshed out. They aren't walking bots. The japanese VA's really nailed the targeted personality traits.
+Good Soundtrack
? I've yet to try out the multiplayer coop but hopefully plan to later. 

My only gripe so far is that sometimes your Mitamas or your AI teammates say something in the middle of a fight and theres no subtitles to know what they say. For an example, theres a couple times where I killed a enemy and my AI teammate Homura says 3 sentences but I have no idea what he just said. Its nothing really but just something that kinda bugs me for a bit.

If you are solely not buying the game just because theres no KB/Mouse support, I feel bad for you. You are missing out. I know that its stupid for KOEI TECHMO to not include it in the PC version but it should be expected if you've ever bought a PC ported game from them. KOEI TECHMO really outdid themselves with this PC port. The FPS cap is actually 60 and not 30 like most of their games and I haven't come across any launch or game breaking errors. Hopefully this game can last me for a few weeks."

												Reviewing the game after 3+ hours (Early review)
The game run super smooth at stable 60 FPS, I had no issues since I started playing, no bug, no crash, everything is perfect!
People that put a bad review on this game are probably just trolls that doesnt know how a PC works!
You'll read on some post that the KB/M support isnt really there..So what? A simple X360 AfterGlow controller or if you have a ps4, use Ds4windows and boom, it works!

Controls work great
Graphics are nice for this kind of game!
The multiple weapon choice and combos are sweet!

Only thing I saw by their website was the number of Large Oni that seems low(I might be mistaken)

Overall, a great game for those who loves the Monster Hunter series and wants this kind of game on PC!
Its a buy
Dont be that gamer that will cry in tears because its 2017 and no KB/M <---which we dont care"

												Not a bad game, But as other reviewers have state it came out at a bad time.
Not sure if ill like this.

The open world feels pale in comparison to recent Zelda and Horizon.

As for the game itself:

It is faster and more responsive then previous games.
There is more to do and there is a little open world thrown into the mix.
It's called ""Open World"" But it is more like small areas attached to one another.
No load screens really other then when doing missions from the mission counter or between story parts.
But it is something to keep in mind.

The music is as good as the previous installments and makes return of old and new tracks.
Bassicly some bosses got recycled so if you played the other Toukiden games you will be reminded of most of the beginner bosses.
But don't let that disencourage you as you will encounter a lot of new big monsters early on.

The ""Demon Hand"" or Hookshot is a nice change of pace which let's you fly around your opponents grappling around and stuff.

Graphics are a bit outdated but considering all Hunter games are either ugly looking or anime-ish this one does a pretty good job of making it look cool.
Specifically the big monsters which all are pretty well detailed and all look really fearsome.

Though Toukiden is known for being rather forgiving I think this installment will test your skills.
I have already ran into enemies which made me use all my Mitama power to take them down.

Mitama indeed make their return and now more then ever, You can hold up to 3 (as far as I have gotten into the story anyways) at a time.
These Mitama are there to: Power you up, Protect you and also to summon shiny things to help you in battle.

This is a solid port, Do keep in mind that as it stands you NEED a CONTROLLER to play the game.
And as much as I have heard PLAYSTATION controllers are NOT supported.
I myself always prefer to have a classic 360 controller at hand becuase those are ALWAYS supported."

												Toukiden 2 a monster-slaying action RPG set in an open-world, fantasy medieval Japan.
Pros:
- A huge selection of weapon types and equipment sets, enabling a wide range of play styles, including melee combat with swords, spears, clubs, etc or ranged combat with bows and guns.
- Beautifully designed characters with Japanese voiceovers.
- Fast paced combat, both in ground or air with the new Demon Hand against various Japanese monsters.
- A huge open world with many different vibes to each setting.
- Performance-wise, very smooth.

Cons:
- Character models look lifeless, no mouth animation.
- World models look outdated.
- Story is somewhat weak compared to other JRPGs."

												I see a lot of negative reviews for thus game in regards to the lack of keyboard and mouse support. What is this 2008? Controllers work on PC now and just as well as on consoles.

Anyway. The only bad things I can say about this game so far is that it does feel like a last generation game as far as the graphics, dialog and interface is concerned. Also, I felt like it took to long to get to the point where you can play online with friends after spamming the next button through all the text based dialog. There is way to much mandatory dialog in the beginning of this game.

Other than that, this game does seem like a Monster Hunter - like game that is either on par with MH or has ever so slightly surpassed it.
The fact that it is on the PC, on Steam, in English and has online multiplayer makes it the best Monster Hunting game in my opinion.

The combat is fluid and feels good. The monsters are interesting. There is a good amount of weapons.

All in all I do feel like the game should be about $15 to $20 cheeper for looking and feeling like a last generation game."

												I played the game with a controller and you should too (Fo' real tho, KB/mouse support is quite lacking)

- Graphically pleasing to look at, although not all that fancy. 
- Open-world
- Decent story, interesting plot.
- Great cast of characters.
- Has an affection system.
- Combat can be either simple or complex depends on the weapon that you choose (There are quite a few of them).
- Each weapon has there own unique movesets that will take quite some time to master.

If you like the Monster Hunter / God Eater games, you'll love this.

I rate this game Benizuki/10 (Please be my mom)"

												Let me make something abundantly clear. I'm not a fanboy of Toukiden franchise. I detested the first Toukiden. No memorable monsters, zero difficulty, boring grind for cash and exp for Mitama ( just like armor skills in Monster Hunter ) but you actually had to level them up to unlock certain skills. It was a bad port and boring game.

So why did I even buy Toukiden 2 you say?

Well I like the hunting ""genre"" too much so I had to at least give it a try. I could have always refund the game right? Yet I didn't...

Is the game a bad port? Yes... yes it is. No mouse support at all ( I was going to play this game with friends but since they are pure PC players they do not use gamepads and won't buy them, so I guess Koei lost some money )
GFX in Toukiden are almost laughable by the current standards. It certainly does not look like a next gen game but polished PS3 game with a sharper resolution. Blurry textures everywhere just look at the character creator and you will disappointed. First time I downloaded the game it wouldn't even launch LOL... had to re-download.

Since you have lasted this far let me quickly point out what I don't like in the game and then why I still recommend it ( albeit not at the current price point ) :

-  weapons didn't really get much new moves ( apart from katana, dual blades and i think that's it... everything feels the same ) That means that I have limited arsenal of weapons that I like and can use. In Monster Hunter I liked almost every weapon. It had weight behind the attacks and It felt like I'm actually helping my team by stunning monsters etc. THAT being said I hated Hbowguns in MH. Toukiden feels a bit easier with ranged weapons which is good. 

- Monsters... yeah still don't like them and still are not memorable at all. Unlike Monster Hunter where most players have their favorites monsters that they LIKE to fight. You learn their moveset and anticipate what they will do. I cannot get the same thrill of the hunt in Toukiden...

- Special Effects could have been toned down because I can't sometimes see what the monster is doing with all the nonsesne going on especially with 4 players/NPC... 

- Still can't find online players :( 

- No items no strategy. Again this is the the Monster Hunter thing ( it really felt good to use flash bomb at the right time or to trap a monster to help out a team ) That element is missing from Toukiden HOWEVER this isn't entirely true. Stay until i point out the positives. 

- Armor design / grind for materials ( Monster Hunter was also Grindy as F,,, could kill monster 14 times to get 1 GEM... while others could have gotten 3... so yeah I had bad luck ) 


THE POSITIVES : 

- new Mitama abilities add depth to the combat! You can have attack speed boost, shadow clone of yourself etc. Makes the game far more interesting and fast paced. However that depth is also a curse because it takes LOOONG time to figure out what works and what does not... Seriously I spent A LONG time in Tutorials which is kinda annoying ( unlike Monster Hunter where I felt at home from the beginning it was easier yet challenging, It was about mastery of your weapon and learning Monster patterns ). 

- I like the new running and grappling hook moves ( which can help your team by smashing monster to the ground for free hits ) Also there are different Mitamas that can help out your friends... ( still prefer items from MH though ). 

- so far I'm impressed with how the story is presented ( voice acting and jokes of the characters ) I like the character build up and the events.. something that was a bit missing from MH ( but in all honestly I don't care about the story but the gameplay itself ) Regardless it was a nice suprise. 

- open world... they managed to keep it interesting ( at least in the beginning ) by adding events, treasure and some hidden stuff ) good job. 

I have to say that this game is at best average but can be fun. If I only had friends to play it with. Also its way more complicated in some ways so it will take time to learn the basics and move on to advanced stuff."

												I can only hope toukiden doesn't do what almost every worthwhile vita game does by offering a much better version to sell full price down the road. I'm saying this because if they offer nintendo a product they may do that. 

In toukiden, you play as a demon slayer hunting down oni and sending them off Monster hunter style. Mitama, fallen soldiers slain by oni, accompany you, offering special active and passive abilities that assist you in battle. Same general idea with equipment, you need the power of your enemies to stand a chance. Nothing new here. Though the grapple arm has special attack and defense attributes that offer some more versatility. The combat is smooth, but to be honest, I am nowhere near being able to take down anything significant in a reasonable amount of time. 

The main difference between this and the other hunters, including the first toukiden, is that instead of short bursts of quests and intense battles, it's a much smoother slow burn of exploration and combat, that doesn't make you feel weird for having a big PC just to play a bunch of 10-15 minute missions, and watch cutscenes. Granted some are longer, but the point still stands.

Toukiden 2 should be what we want, a feature filled open world hunter rpg that actually uses a healthy combination of open areas, movement and action mechanics, as well as augmentations that anyone would think about while playing, like mid attack evasion, invincibility, critical attacks, stamina recovery, attack buffs defence buffs, and recovering your magic use through sending demons. A combination of spirits that slightly or drastically alter the gameplay through skills and magic. Light heavy and signature attacks that offer more expansive types of combat. Everything is there.

Is it worth 60 or so dollars? I would almost always say no. But to be honest, if this is what people want, they need to show for it in sales, This is one less game we need to buy a different console for or wait a decade or so to be able to play it. And because the vita is on its way out, that's one less platform holding the game back down the line. And I'd like to think that koei is not going to let a series die once they started it up. I will admit that depending on your taste in hunter games you may be better off holding out, and I will also admit that if capcom took a look outside and decided that they want to make a PC monster hunter or another dragons dogma that gets finished, I will have a few regrets. The concept they decided to push is worth the money. But I can't help wondering why no one else was doing it. Because upon a closer look, it does look like they're reusuing assets."

												I came into buying this game under the thought that If I didn't like it or if it didn't work well like the firs one then I would refund it. I am glad to say I do not feel the need to refund this game. It runs much more smoothly then the previous port a tiny bit of lag but i feel that is based on my computer as it is below the requirements having an i5 and not an i7 core, however this lag is very miniscule and at times I forget that it is there, meaning this game is good to play even if you don't have an amazing computer. It keeps all the feels that I like abut monster hunter and adds an open world that greatly improves the hunt.  I would definetly suggest giving it a try if you are into these types of games."

												I really wanted to like this game since I played Toukiden Kiwami on PS4 and enjoyed it quite a bit, so an improved version on pc should have been awesome. Should have been.
The game started with a small launcher, an oddity but not unheard of. It showed the launcher in Japanese by default, but it was easy to change this to English. After this I saw that windowed mode was also the default so I also changed this.
But this is only the launcher right? Nope.

When entering the menu I found out the prompts were for an xbox controller even though I didn't have one plugged in. Decided to change a few options first. Saw the video settings by default were locked to 30 fps so I changed this to 60 since they can't be unlocked also changed details to high from medium.
This didn't affect gameplay for me, but I have a 1070 GTX so I am not exactly the ""average"" player on that front.
After changing the video options I went to sound options and saw that sound is a slider that ranges from small to large instead of soft to loud or low to high. A small thing, but translation is kind of a big deal if you don't understand the original language (Japanese). Seeing the translation in the menu I decided to skip the story since I don't trust the translation.

When starting to play I noticed the attention that character creation got which was nice. A lot of hairstyles etc. and quite a few sliders for things. It was nice to create the character I had on PS4 and improve on her appearance with more options.

After this the game started and I started to test the controls in the ""tutorial"". I put tutorial between quotes since it showed controls for an xbox controller instead of mouse and keyboard.
The first thing I noticed was that the mouse isn't used...at all. Instead you adjust the camera with G,H,J, and T while moving with W, A, S, and D. This came over really weird while playing, so I wanted to change the camera controls to numpad since mouse wasn't an option. As it turns out numpad cannot be used at all and neither can the arrows so you are pretty much stuck with awkward controls.
After movement I tested attacking with J, I, K, and L. Picking up items requires you to press and hold O and using magic is done by holding O and pressing one of the attack keys.
While pressing keys randomly I didn't get lock on to work and I was just about done with the entire control setup, but I decided to finish the tutorial with keyboard only and I can tell this game is absolute garbage when playing with keyboard since you need 3 hands with fingers ranging from A to L to play optimally without lock on.
After the tutorial I plugged in a dualshock 4 controller noticed the game didn't acknowledge it. No biggy I will restart the game since it most likely is a bug with playing it in while playing. Again a no since the controller can't be used. I also noticed this with Dark Souls 3 and find it odd that a game that also releases on PS4 can't use a PS4 controller. With this game however I find it a bigger deal since this game only releases on PS4 and PC and can't even be used with the controller of 1 of the 2 platforms.

This was the point where I decided to go for a refund since I was done. I dont want to control my character with W, A, S, and D while controlling the camera with T, F, G, H and also attacking with I, J, K, and L. The person who tested controls was either drunk and just said it was great or a mutant. Locking on might resolve the camera control issue, but when playing Kiwami I didn't use lock on all that much, so I don't want to adjust my playstyle in such a way just to get past a limitation in the controls that shouldn't be there.
Maybe I will check the game again if it can be used with DS4 or when it has proper mouse and keyboard controls, but right now I just couldn't enjoy it at all and uninstalled it after the tutorial. I doubt it though."

												My first Toukiden series on PC. Played the previous on PS4 and PS Vita. Love the series. Heard about the bad port for the previous entry. But this one definitely is a step up. Options to set 30 / 60fps. Not alot of other settings to set except for low med or high for a couple of different effects texture and etc. Which is kinda expected for most console ports for PC. Most importantly it is very well optimized as far as I can tell. Run almost 60fps lock the entire time.

This entry while it retains some of the core mechanic from previous, quite a number of things have been tweaked. Felt awkward at first mainly due to the impression from the previous series. But very quickly able to get into it. In fact the enimations looks and feel more natural than the previous. Besides weapons, a lot of other new things have been added. More abilities to play around with now which leads to more customization. Which is awesome.

This one feels really fresh when it comes to monster hunting genre. Rather than just doing generic counter accept quest then depart and hunt. It now works a little differently. In the previous entry, certain part of the counter quest will link to your main story line while some are optionals. Now as far as I have seen so far, it seems like they are no longer that case. Counter quest are still there for you to take, but it do not seems to tie directly to the main story line. You actually have the choice to also go on open world exploration. Yes I mean fully open world unlike previous entry or most other monter hunter games where the maps are divided into zones. During open world exploration, you can go material hunting, and along the way you may hit up to some NPCs that asking for help which are sorta side quest. They are completely optional, so you can shoose to do or not to. On top of that while doing open world exploration, you may also run into other slayers fighting Oni. And you can join up with them  as a joint operation and fight along their side. Upon clearing they will actually join you for a short while to help you back. That is a really nice touch. Also the relationship among NPCs seems to have a change in approach. Unlike previously mostly you try to increase your relationship by going to SPA (hot bath), now it seems like they are doing a mass efffect style where how you pick your dialogs can directly affect your relationship with each individual. Also helping them with task can also further build relationship.

This is not actually a full review but rather an early impression of the game. So far it has been really positive. A great departure from the previous entry while keeping quite a bit of good stuffs that what makes this game fun in the first place.

Do take note that it is recommended that you have a gamepad before you purchase this game. It is not only highly recommended but essential for a game like this. The controls on the first 2 entries are already pretty complex on keyboard. Thou I have not played the earlier ones on PC since I did them on PS4 and Vita, But I can imagine how hard will it be to play on keyboard. Don't expect an easier control this time around. Because on top of all the previous stuffs, there are even more new controls in this game. You can ignore most of the negative reviews in the comment section. I can only say they are mostly idiots. You can't expect a game with complex controls to work well with keyboard in the first place. This is not a FPS/TPS. And neither it plays like monster hunter which is pretty slow. This is a fast pace and extremely action based monster hunting game. With a lot of abilities unlike in monster hunter series. So to those complaining about keyboard control, use your initiative. Obviously it is not going to work even if they are going to have keyboard control. Not evey thing works with keyboard. This is why gamepad exist. Its like complaining you cant have precise acceleration and steering in a driving game because you are playing on keyboard instead of a racing wheel / gamepad. That is just idiotic."

												Port runs perfectly as far as I can tell a couple missions in. 

Mostly just leaving a postive recommendation because not supporting mouse in a hunting game isn't enough to say not recommeded and the current negative review reatio is dumb, hope this helps.

edit: For the actual game itself, it's pretty much Monster Hunter with Japanese mythology style. From what I'm reading it's still lighter on content than monster hunter games are, but still has more than enough to go past 50 hours. If you've never played another hunting game before, read a more in depth review. :V"

												This game is:
Capped at 60FPS and 1920x1080 resolution
Best played with a controller
Well optimized (always running at 60FPS without fail, see specs below)
A ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun
The closest thing we're getting to Monster Hunter on PC for a long time
Wonderfully voiced with a Japanese dub (only English subs)
Open-world
A ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun
And a ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun

If you're an avid Monster Hunter fan, this is pretty close but a bit faster paced depending on the weapon you choose. Definitely worth the pickup especially while the DLC will be free for the next month.

												Solid game. The additon of the open world was a really good step up from Kiwami (which I frankly found boring).

That said, the targetting still needs a bit of getting used to while the plot is interesting so far. The Oni hunting mechanics are still fun and the new demon hand is pretty handy (forgive the unintentional pun) to have during Otherworld treks. The mythos of the world are eally intriguing and worth investing the time into.  

The port runs well for the most part (it did stutter a bit during one battle but that was very short and inconsequential). I see myself investing a lot of hours in this game and the game is definitely worth the asking price.

PS: Don't forget the free Mitama, they give you a really good boost in the beginning."

												Extremely good game, just remember a few things:
A.  It's a hunting game.  And all this implies (seeing same enemies a lot, using body parts to craft gear, and so on).  If you enjoyed God Eater you will probably like it.
B.  Use a controller.  Extremely minimal mouse support, more importantly this type of game feels 10x better with a controller.  Sounds like you need to download the ps4 drivers yourself if you have a DS4 fyi.
C.  If you want the game to be harder, don't bring AI companions.  They are insanely good, can rez you, don't die themselves, and can kill most things without your help.  Just bring your waifu/husbando if you must.  Makes farming random parts a lot easier with a full party honestly.
D.  All the dialogue is in Japanese.  I consider this a plus mostly, but it is a bit off putting when you never know what their random comments in the game world mean.  So far the translation has been pretty good though.
E.  Max is 60 fps with 1080p resolution.  No freaking idea when this became a ""letdown"".  

So far I'm loving it.  Action is pretty fun, there's a ton of combat systems in place and I haven't tried most of the weapons yet.  Haven't gotten bored with my Weighted Sickle at all.  I've had no issues whatsoever when playing, maybe a tiny bit of slowdown during one fight that had tons of adds as well as my summons and a full team.  Otherwise runs flawless.  Haven't tried multiplayer yet, so can't comment on that.

Was worth every penny."

												A vast improvement over the game that I recall watching TotalBiscuit criticise. The developers have learned from the mistake of the past and not only fixed all of the issues but seem to have done their own thing to set the game out from Monster Hunter.

I can say this is probably the closest we have to Monster Hunter of PC but unlike that game this one opts for a more open world over the mission arenas we had seen in Monster Hunter and God Eater.

The game has received some flak due to initial misinformation and the apparant lack of mouse support for the game but if you can forgive the lack of mouse functionality, or you use a controller (Like you really should do for any Action RPG to be honest) then you will have a very good time here."

												First of all; if you don't have a controller, do not get this game.
It lacks mouse support so your options are keyboard or controller.

This little review also assumes you've tried the first one or are familiar with monster hunting games. And it's spoiler free. But there's not much to spoil anyway.

What I love:
Open World - In most monster hunting games, you have a village that acts as a hub. In that hub, you can choose which missions to go out on and you go to the general mission area. From there, you have all these little instances of maps that you go through one by one til you get to the final zone and then you get ported back. That's gone from this game. You actually just walk out of the village and explore the oni infested lands with some party members.

Mission Structure - I feel like I needed to separate this part before I get off track before I talk about the quests any further. Story missions will have you go out into the open world to complete your stuff. You also complete some side quests this way (e.g. find this person, kill the oni hanging out by that tree over there, I can't leave this cave with that oni right outside, basic fetch quest, basic escort quest). 

Then there are ""Phase Missions"" where you talk to someone at the front desk and when you leave the village, you'll get ported to the exact area you're supposed to be. Then you just kill everything in the vicinity. Pretty watered down version of the older monster hunting style quests.

Combat - You get an item early on called the ""Demon Hand"" that allows you to grapple towards objects and enemies a la Attack on Titan. This is so huge for movement in these games. Bosses often fly across the map and it sucks catching up to them only for them to fly across again. Last time I played a game like this that gave you a good amount of movement was Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce. All weaponsets have a small dodge while some have also have guard/parry. It's pretty fast paced if you play with the right weapons. To mix things up for your playstyle are the Mitama that you attach to your gear. Some specialize in dealing damage, destroying monster body parts, moving quickly, movement impairing, healing, buffing, tanking, etc.

Things I like:
Upgrading weapons - Kill monsters for their parts and use them to upgrade weapons in several different ways. You can either increase its raw damage, critical rate, or elemental damage. Then you can reforge them into stronger variations.
Armor works the same. Increase defense or increase the rate of your health regen (but not really, idk it's stupid).

A.I. - Monsters behave how they're supposed to. Party members are pretty efficient. Have yet to run into issues.

Complaints (so far):

Mini map - Kinda hard to navigate with it. You can resize it but all the sizes are just so awkward. I think if the character indicator arrows also resized with it. Arrow points in the direction of the story quest but you can't get it to track other quests. It also doesn't help navigate you to the quest, as in which path you should take. You'll go down one fork in the road only to end up having to backtrack pretty far back. This wasn't a problem til I got to....... the snow area.

So you have to do is press Start and press X to see the full map, not the map that shows up when you initially press Start. At least you can set waypoints but I think that works the same as the stupid arrow in the minimap.

Terminology - I swear that this is the worst thing about this game (because I'm not having technical issues :D   ).
Your passives will refer to all these different abilities and you don't even know what they are. Example,
Onslaught+ (Orthodox)
Increases the damage you inflict when attacking an Oni from straight on when using Onslaught.
Cannot find Onslaught in the game's encyclopedia. Orthodox? What significance does that word have? ""Straight on"" probably means when you're not attacking an enemy from behind. Does the side count? I wish there was a way to highlight keywords and the game will show you what it is in the game.

Demon Hand - For the most part it's great. But when you aim with it by holding RT, you can't cancel out of it unless you dodge which uses up your focus/stamina. Or you can just let it go and whiff it. Why would you cancel out of it in the first place? Cause you think you can grapple on to an enemy but then they're not in range anymore or you misjudged the distance. A small and partial fix for this would be to change the color of the lock on target indicator when an enemy's in range of the demon hand.

Day/Night - There's a day/night cycle. It makes a small difference. Oni are more powerful at night. Some sidequests can only be completed at night. In a few areas, you can't really tell if it's day or night so to have an icon on the minimap and in the main map would be helpful.

Haven't touched:
Multiplayer - Waiting for a friend. Also can't find a random lobby. PS4 might have more luck or Andromeda is stealing the crowd lol.
Item Synthesis - Doesn't look useful yet. Maybe later in the game.
Bonding with party members - Don't really know the purpose of this. I have an idea based on the first game though.
Sending gatherers out to bring back materials every X minutes - Well, I do this. But it always fails. Need to upgrade gatherers a bit more but to do so is pretty difficult.

												For those who are new to toukiden : its basically monster hunter but you fight demon instead; if u ask what monster hunter, err its hack and slash game where you co-op to destroy your gigantic monster body parts.

changes in toukiden 2 from the 1st :
you can zoom out ( much like bird view than 3rd person view)
added 2 weapon (shield & sword & blade whip)
katana now have new procedure to enter hyper gouge
knife you can air dash now
bow have backflip during aim mode
rifle you can reload after shooting or rapid reload

new mitama lvling system and skills

unity attack changed to demon hand, which actually destroy the part and wont regrow at all (you can actually make a demon limp with no feet now.)

if you explore map without taking mission it will be an open world ( much like MMO, with random skirmish mission)

Afterwords, I dont think you guys need a review. you would love it, just spend the money ""it's worth it""!"

Had a problem with graphics, but that's because of the dual-integrated graphic on my laptop detecting the Intel graphic card, so if anybody has FPS issues, just force change your graphic card.

												Let me make something abundantly clear. I'm not a fanboy of Toukiden franchise. I detested the first Toukiden. No memorable monsters, zero difficulty, boring grind for cash and exp for Mitama ( just like armor skills in Monster Hunter ) but you actually had to level them up to unlock certain skills. It was a bad port and boring game.

So why did I even buy Toukiden 2 you say?

Well I like the hunting ""genre"" too much so I had to at least give it a try. I could have always refund the game right? Yet I didn't...

Is the game a bad port? Yes... yes it is. No mouse support at all ( I was going to play this game with friends but since they are pure PC players they do not use gamepads and won't buy them, so I guess Koei lost some money )
GFX in Toukiden are almost laughable by the current standards. It certainly does not look like a next gen game but polished PS3 game with a sharper resolution. Blurry textures everywhere just look at the character creator and you will disappointed. First time I downloaded the game it wouldn't even launch LOL... had to re-download.

Since you have lasted this far let me quickly point out what I don't like in the game and then why I still recommend it ( albeit not at the current price point ) :

-  weapons didn't really get much new moves ( apart from katana, dual blades and i think that's it... everything feels the same ) That means that I have limited arsenal of weapons that I like and can use. In Monster Hunter I liked almost every weapon. It had weight behind the attacks and It felt like I'm actually helping my team by stunning monsters etc. THAT being said I hated Hbowguns in MH. Toukiden feels a bit easier with ranged weapons which is good. 

- Monsters... yeah still don't like them and still are not memorable at all. Unlike Monster Hunter where most players have their favorites monsters that they LIKE to fight. You learn their moveset and anticipate what they will do. I cannot get the same thrill of the hunt in Toukiden...

- Special Effects could have been toned down because I can't sometimes see what the monster is doing with all the nonsesne going on especially with 4 players/NPC... 

- Still can't find online players :( 

- No items no strategy. Again this is the the Monster Hunter thing ( it really felt good to use flash bomb at the right time or to trap a monster to help out a team ) That element is missing from Toukiden HOWEVER this isn't entirely true. Stay until i point out the positives. 

- Armor design / grind for materials ( Monster Hunter was also Grindy as F,,, could kill monster 14 times to get 1 GEM... while others could have gotten 3... so yeah I had bad luck ) 


THE POSITIVES : 

- new Mitama abilities add depth to the combat! You can have attack speed boost, shadow clone of yourself etc. Makes the game far more interesting and fast paced. However that depth is also a curse because it takes LOOONG time to figure out what works and what does not... Seriously I spent A LONG time in Tutorials which is kinda annoying ( unlike Monster Hunter where I felt at home from the beginning it was easier yet challenging, It was about mastery of your weapon and learning Monster patterns ). 

- I like the new running and grappling hook moves ( which can help your team by smashing monster to the ground for free hits ) Also there are different Mitamas that can help out your friends... ( still prefer items from MH though ). 

- so far I'm impressed with how the story is presented ( voice acting and jokes of the characters ) I like the character build up and the events.. something that was a bit missing from MH ( but in all honestly I don't care about the story but the gameplay itself ) Regardless it was a nice suprise. 

- open world... they managed to keep it interesting ( at least in the beginning ) by adding events, treasure and some hidden stuff ) good job. 

I have to say that this game is at best average but can be fun. If I only had friends to play it with. Also its way more complicated in some ways so it will take time to learn the basics and move on to advanced stuff."

												Open world Toukiden! It's for sure an improvment over the previous games.

So far it's shown to be a great port, which is suprising coming from KOEI TECMO. No issues on this side. 
Bewarned though, some people are having issues getting it to launch. It seems if you can launch it, it's smooth sailing from there. Put that Steam refund capability to use if it's not launching. Highly recommend using a controller to play, as there's currently no mouse support. I've had zero issues using an Xbone controller.

With that said, I'm stoked to what see what kind of crazy Oni I'll get to slay in this round of Toukiden."

												Funny enough, when this game first hit it had tons of negative reviews, and you know what they were all complaining about? Controller support. Other than that, this game supports 60 FPS and is optimized very well, the graphics are also taken from the PS4 version yet again so while not absolutely stunning, the visuals are very clean and solid.

Anyway, if you're not that shallow and can look past the fact that the Keyboard and Mouse controls for this game are practically non existant, then what you'll find here is something truely beautiful.

Toukiden 2 is the kind of game where once you play it, you'll be witnessing the transformation of a game that was merely ""another of it's genre"" into it's own unique identity.

In the first Toukiden, you could very much say that it's basically Toei's version of a Monster Hunter game, with a little more focus on getting in on the action instead of gathering and preparing for the fight (whether that's a good thing or not is entirely up to preferance). But now, Toukiden 2 has pulled out all the stops and decided to go in it's own direction completely. It's a sequel that does the concept of sequels justice.

Toukiden 2 keeps all of the main mechanics from the first game that made it a MonHun style game, but improves on every aspect. Combat definitely feels a little more fluid and now there are two new weapons to try out as well. But that's where the similarities to the ever advancing MonHun series stops.

First thing you'll notice (at least in singleplayer) is that Toukiden 2 is a seemless fully open world game. There aren't any loading screens when you're exploring in the open world, only in cutscenes and mission modes. This alone changes the entire feeling of the game, it's massive and it's full of huge monsters to slay. The game then lets you take your entire party out into the open world, so now you've got a party based action heavy MonHun-like game that's set in an open world, you'll feel like it's got some Dragon's Dogma vibes going on, and that's incredible. Not only that, but in some areas, it'll feel like you're delving into something akin to Phantasy Star Online at times as well.

It starts meshing to the point where it's hard to simply compare it to one or two games of established genres and you'll see how it just becomes a crock pot of gaming ideas that forms into something that can only be Toukiden 2.

As for the multiplayer, it basically progresses like a classic MonHun game, where you just do missions, murder stuff, make stuff out of the stuff you murdered, then murder more stuff. It's a vicious cycle but it still works very well. There is however, no open world for multiplayer, but don't let that turn you away because there are what's known as ""Patrol Missions"" where they let you just roam around entire sections of the open world like the starting hill area or the entire zone including all the areas under the ""Age of Peace"" label and so on and so forth, which honestly, is more than enough considering that aside from the very first open world area, the places you can go to are absolutely massive.

Overall, I would say that unlike the first game which had an abysmal launch, if you're a fan of MonHun style games or even just Action RPG games then this one's a must buy. It takes all the things that worked in the first and improves upon everything while doing so many things new that while it may feel similar, it will also feel completely new and fresh at the same time.

TL;DR Summary
Okay so, you take Dynasty Warrirors' Style, Monster Hunter's Gameplay, Dragon's Dogma's Open World JRPG Feeling, and Toukiden's Setting, throw them all into a blender and MIX THE **** OUT OF THEM. Then you get this game. It's a mish mashed monster, but it has all the good crispy bits, and who doesn't like crispy bits?

TL;DR Basic Port Stats
- 60 FPS
- Very well optimized, runs buttery smooth
- Fullscreen basically functions as Borderless Windowed
- However the Keyboard and Mouse controls are complete trash, gonna need a controller for this one.




Oh and I forgot to mention, if you like Waifus and Husbandos, the affection system is still very much intact from the first game. Get your body ready to bathe with best girl or best guy... or both ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

												I played the game with a controller and you should too (Fo' real tho, KB/mouse support is quite lacking)

- Graphically pleasing to look at, although not all that fancy. 
- Open-world
- Decent story, interesting plot.
- Great cast of characters.
- Has an affection system.
- Combat can be either simple or complex depends on the weapon that you choose (There are quite a few of them).
- Each weapon has there own unique movesets that will take quite some time to master.

If you like the Monster Hunter / God Eater games, you'll love this.

I rate this game Benizuki/10 (Please be my mom)"

												Here's my 8 hours take on the game.

First, the boring stuff:

- No mouse support
- It's locked in 60 fps
- It's an overall superior port to the original Toukiden but it's still a port and not something created from the ground up
- Only consider this game if you have a controller; Keyboard controls are pure garbage

Now let's talk about the game.
They finally did it.
They took the Hunting genre created and maintened for years and year from Monster Hunter and created a ""clone"" that still is pretty much a clone in certain aspects while bringing a whole new flow to the gameplay.

You got your typical ""grab the quest, hunt the monster"" you are expecting from the genre but then you got a fully fledged action RPG on top of it and presented as the main course. This is one of the better open world experiences, I've stumbled into some secrets that opened new ways of bulding my own character in the game. It felt like the more I explore, the cooler the secrets I find. I'll relay this gameplay loop as my experience:

Behind a massive boulder from the souther region of the ""Age of Honor"" region of the map, there was this small shrine. I was lost, trying to find a way to reach my destination that did not travel in the ""Underworld"" cave system because if I did, my character would be poisoned by the Miasma and die.

So I stopped and decided to check on the shrine. There I found a figure of Japanese/German history I've never even heard about, Siebold (Philipp Franz von Siebold).

The character explains why his spirit was trapped there and asks for you to track a specific Demon with your ""Oni Slaying Vision"" and bring one of it's part for him to analyze.

So I track the creature, have a climatic showdown in the heart of an abandoned city and manage to bring the part to this Siebold fellow, who then is absorbed. He is one of the ""Mitama"", spirits that customize how you play the game. Think armor skills from Monster Hunter on steroids.

This partircular Mitama had a bunch of synergy with the Whip weapon, so I decided to try. Aiming explosive kunai tem smashing them with the whip and blowing up specific parts of the monster quickly turned me into an addict. And it's all thanks to this random thing I ran on the scenery that gave me the push to try different weapons, builds and approachs.

So far, this game is more than a step up from Toukiden 1 - It's a unique and refined take on the Hunting genre. When it tries to be copy cat Monhun it stumbles, but when it's being itself, it's an all around fun time. Let's see if the feeling persists through my next 8 hours."

												Played toukiden 1 and kiwami on vita, tried demo on ps4 and now playing on pc. Gameplay improved, graphics tiny bit outdated but runs fine on 60 fps. Lots of new bosses and mechanics. Open world is also an improvement. Gameplay is much more fun than kiwami with the additional powers. 
There is absolutely no difference between the pc & ps4 version so there are no complaints. anyone crying about mouse support .. i just can't imagine this game with a mouse. None of the Koei games are made with mouse. All i can say is: keep up the good work Koei tecmo and thank you for releasing a pc version that works perfect."

												Toukiden 2 a monster-slaying action RPG set in an open-world, fantasy medieval Japan.
Pros:
- A huge selection of weapon types and equipment sets, enabling a wide range of play styles, including melee combat with swords, spears, clubs, etc or ranged combat with bows and guns.
- Beautifully designed characters with Japanese voiceovers.
- Fast paced combat, both in ground or air with the new Demon Hand against various Japanese monsters.
- A huge open world with many different vibes to each setting.
- Performance-wise, very smooth.

Cons:
- Character models look lifeless, no mouth animation.
- World models look outdated.
- Story is somewhat weak compared to other JRPGs."

												My first Toukiden series on PC. Played the previous on PS4 and PS Vita. Love the series. Heard about the bad port for the previous entry. But this one definitely is a step up. Options to set 30 / 60fps. Not alot of other settings to set except for low med or high for a couple of different effects texture and etc. Which is kinda expected for most console ports for PC. Most importantly it is very well optimized as far as I can tell. Run almost 60fps lock the entire time.

This entry while it retains some of the core mechanic from previous, quite a number of things have been tweaked. Felt awkward at first mainly due to the impression from the previous series. But very quickly able to get into it. In fact the enimations looks and feel more natural than the previous. Besides weapons, a lot of other new things have been added. More abilities to play around with now which leads to more customization. Which is awesome.

This one feels really fresh when it comes to monster hunting genre. Rather than just doing generic counter accept quest then depart and hunt. It now works a little differently. In the previous entry, certain part of the counter quest will link to your main story line while some are optionals. Now as far as I have seen so far, it seems like they are no longer that case. Counter quest are still there for you to take, but it do not seems to tie directly to the main story line. You actually have the choice to also go on open world exploration. Yes I mean fully open world unlike previous entry or most other monter hunter games where the maps are divided into zones. During open world exploration, you can go material hunting, and along the way you may hit up to some NPCs that asking for help which are sorta side quest. They are completely optional, so you can shoose to do or not to. On top of that while doing open world exploration, you may also run into other slayers fighting Oni. And you can join up with them  as a joint operation and fight along their side. Upon clearing they will actually join you for a short while to help you back. That is a really nice touch. Also the relationship among NPCs seems to have a change in approach. Unlike previously mostly you try to increase your relationship by going to SPA (hot bath), now it seems like they are doing a mass efffect style where how you pick your dialogs can directly affect your relationship with each individual. Also helping them with task can also further build relationship.

This is not actually a full review but rather an early impression of the game. So far it has been really positive. A great departure from the previous entry while keeping quite a bit of good stuffs that what makes this game fun in the first place.

Do take note that it is recommended that you have a gamepad before you purchase this game. It is not only highly recommended but essential for a game like this. The controls on the first 2 entries are already pretty complex on keyboard. Thou I have not played the earlier ones on PC since I did them on PS4 and Vita, But I can imagine how hard will it be to play on keyboard. Don't expect an easier control this time around. Because on top of all the previous stuffs, there are even more new controls in this game. You can ignore most of the negative reviews in the comment section. I can only say they are mostly idiots. You can't expect a game with complex controls to work well with keyboard in the first place. This is not a FPS/TPS. And neither it plays like monster hunter which is pretty slow. This is a fast pace and extremely action based monster hunting game. With a lot of abilities unlike in monster hunter series. So to those complaining about keyboard control, use your initiative. Obviously it is not going to work even if they are going to have keyboard control. Not evey thing works with keyboard. This is why gamepad exist. Its like complaining you cant have precise acceleration and steering in a driving game because you are playing on keyboard instead of a racing wheel / gamepad. That is just idiotic."

												Only played into the game 4 hours but I'm already enjoying the hell out of it. A lot has been improved, including the landscapes. No loading between any rooms anymore because everything is already loaded. I was skeptical about the whole ""open-world"" thing but it seems to have been implemented very well.

Not only have two new weapon types been added (Sword and shield, chain whip) but all the other weapon types have had new moves added to them further increasing their viability and adding something to draw you back into those types so you're not spending all your time with the two new ones.

The is also a very VERY clean port. I had Kiwami on the PS4 so I can't speak for the PC version but this game runs smooth as silk on my rig. Loading times are also ridiculously short as well which is a wonder as all the ages are linked together into one giant map with no seperate ""room"" loading like in Kiwami.

The Demon-Hand thing seems just a tad gimmicky to me, though. I'm still trying to learn all it's ins-and-outs but I hardly use the damn thing.

The characters aren't as compelling as the original cast in Toukiden: Age of Demons but they get pretty damn close. Of course I'm also not very far in so I may grow to love them like I did the original cast. I do really like Benizuki though, she's pretty rad.

This part doesn't affect me as I use controller but it's a tad bit silly to not have mouse support on a PC game. I'm also wondering if this is intentional or not as I've seen some text in the game that wasn't quite... right? One of the screenshots explaining something was a Japanese screen shot and when sending my machina out on a survey the survey time was shown as ""Survey Time"" not ""long"" ""very long"" or anything like that. A few things just seems a tad weird to me so the lack of mouse support may not be intended.

All in all a very good game and a very good sequel to the original. I highly recommend picking it up."

												Crashes started on the first real mission after the intro fight. Crashed immediately upon gaining control of my character, then crashed just loading into that same fight, then I turned the graphics settings from high to medium. Thought that fixed it, then 3 minutes into that same mission, crashed again. You have to fast forward through dialogue and put up with a little bit of unskippable stuff to get from the most recent autosave to that fight. Sitting through that ♥♥♥♥ 3 times in 5 minutes is too much for me. Won't be touching this game again until it gets fixed."

												For those who are new to toukiden : its basically monster hunter but you fight demon instead; if u ask what monster hunter, err its hack and slash game where you co-op to destroy your gigantic monster body parts.

changes in toukiden 2 from the 1st :
you can zoom out ( much like bird view than 3rd person view)
added 2 weapon (shield & sword & blade whip)
katana now have new procedure to enter hyper gouge
knife you can air dash now
bow have backflip during aim mode
rifle you can reload after shooting or rapid reload

new mitama lvling system and skills

unity attack changed to demon hand, which actually destroy the part and wont regrow at all (you can actually make a demon limp with no feet now.)

if you explore map without taking mission it will be an open world ( much like MMO, with random skirmish mission)

Afterwords, I dont think you guys need a review. you would love it, just spend the money ""it's worth it""!"

												This is a great game, and reminds me a alot of monster hunter for the 3ds

       - It a great looking game, visuals are pretty nice, actually feels as if im in a mmo like Tera for instance
       
       -Runs at 60 fps

       - Music in this game is nice as well
       
       -Combat in this game fun and challenging 

       -Lots of content and weapons to use, on a side note each weapon has it own combos and moveset that takes getting   used to  

       -Online seems to be a bit slow (probs my connection doe)

On my personal opinion I want to state that as Koei game i never expect to use the Keyboard and mouse, always a controller because to me Koei never makes using the keyboard fun. So if you have a controller, have fun but if not good luck."

												I just started playing but so far so good. It certainly is a better port than Toukiden Kiwami what with having a 60fps option.  One thing though, you absolutely need a controller to enjoy this game. You could play with a keyboard but just forget about it. It's really not ideal. Will update this review once i spen more time with the game."

												Toukiden 2. How should I say this?

It is such a great improvement from Kiwami. Seriously. 
Considering how bad that port was, this was so much better. I barely had any crashes, and lag just wasn't there. The funny thing is, all those bad reviews when the game first came out was from no mouse and keyboard support. Just buy a controller and play this game if you're a Monster Hunter fan, it's a great substitute for PC. But if you want a Pros and Cons list, here you go.

PROS:

-Graphically pleasing, not the best, but it's still cool.

-Decent story, though a little rushed at times (But that's just me nitpicking)

-A lot of armor sets and weapons (They even added about two more weapon types, sword & shield and chain & whip)

-Characters can be pretty amusing at times, it doesn't feel like they're just robots saying the lines because they were ordered to.

-Voice acting is great too.

-Gameplay is great.

-Game isn't too difficult, or too easy.

-Grammar mistakes at times, but this always gives me a laugh so I'll put it here, in PROs. (This is also me nitpicking)

-Has multiplayer. (Though if you want to play with less than four friends, you'd have to take NPCs with you. But that's it.)

CONS:

-The Multiplayer has a built in mic, which I honestly don't want to use. So far I'm not sure if there's a way to turn off the mic.

-No Keyboard+Mouse support, but honestly, this isn't such a big problem. You can easily just configure your keyboard to your liking, or just buy a controller, which I highly suggest you do.

In conclusion, Toukiden 2 is a great game. Buy it. If you don't think it's worth the price, wait for some sort of a sale. Then buy it."

												I know I don't have much playtime and i know a lot of people will complain about that, but just stay with me for a second and let me explain.

The game it self is a lot better then the first one.
The graphics are okay.
Its nothing to jump up and scream about, but it definitely does the job. 
(Could be more graphical settings in my opinion) 

The sounds track is nice and the sound engineering is on point.


So why am I giving it a thumbs down? 

Because the games has no real mouse support at all.
This is on PC and I know a lot of you will say: But games like this are meant to be played with a controller. And I agree! But you must understand not everyone will nor want to use a controller.

Overall there are some minor issues while tabbing in and out of the game.
But port-wise besides the mouse there is nothing major wrong it.


It's a HUGE step-up from the first game they released on PC.


Do I recommend getting the game now? 
Completely up to you, but my two cents are.

If you are okay with the no real mouse support and the OK graphics then yes go for it.
If you are not okay with these issues then I recommend waiting.


PS: I know I talked mostly about the port, that's because I have not gotten to far in the game yet, but what i have seen so far its definitely an okay game.

												Solid game. The additon of the open world was a really good step up from Kiwami (which I frankly found boring).

That said, the targetting still needs a bit of getting used to while the plot is interesting so far. The Oni hunting mechanics are still fun and the new demon hand is pretty handy (forgive the unintentional pun) to have during Otherworld treks. The mythos of the world are eally intriguing and worth investing the time into.  

The port runs well for the most part (it did stutter a bit during one battle but that was very short and inconsequential). I see myself investing a lot of hours in this game and the game is definitely worth the asking price.

PS: Don't forget the free Mitama, they give you a really good boost in the beginning."

												For those fan of Monster Hunter out there, Toukiden is so far a good mimic of  hunting monster game  with a little bit twist of Dynasty Warriors combine. Toukiden 2 is solid port with run on 60fps/1080p  with a good graphic design Koei/Tecmo.

 So far i did not see any crash or shutter at all the only this to complaint anIt's lack of supporting keyboard+ mouse so you may need to have controller to play fully enjoy this game.

At the end,  I just want to say again if you are play monster hunter series but this have console to play that , this is the game so close to that on PC for the moment you can play."
